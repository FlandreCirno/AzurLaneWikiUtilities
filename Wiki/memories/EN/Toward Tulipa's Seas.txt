Iron Blood Embassy, Iris Orthodoxy<br>
Dinner Party<br>
I received an invitation to a formal banquet from Bismarck, and now Memphis and I have come to their embassy.<br>
While hosting a banquet in an embassy isn't exceedingly unusual, it certainly is when it's in an Iron Blood embassy.<br>
This place, usually solemn and deathly silent, is brimming with life tonight.<br>
After verifying my identity and going through the embassy's main gate, a well-maintained lawn lined with trees comes into view.<br>
This is a fairly large banquet. The venue spans from the hall indoors, past a roofed and semi-outdoor space, and all the way into the garden.<br>
People come and go, glasses cling, and the buzzes with laughter and conversations. The celebrations are in full swing.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Wow... This is nowhere near as formal and lifeless as I expected it to be.<br>
Granted, I've never been to an Iron Blood banquet before. I just thought their parties would be like their army.<br>
But no, they're actually hosting a leisurely event here. Never judge a book by its cover.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Maybe the Orthodoxy's romantic vibe has influenced them a bit?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Hmm. Yeah, probably. I take back what I just said.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
So much for that. More pertinently, have you seen the Kingdom of Tulipa's delegation?<br>
I don't see any of Bismarck's entourage either.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
The Tulipans are the stars of the show tonight. You'll probably find them wherever the crowd is the largest.<br>
Let's head inside, shall we? It's cold out tonight.<br>
<br>
I enter the hall and my ears are met with an impassioned symphony.<br>
In stark contrast to the graceful atmosphere in the courtyard, the hall and all its furnishings are far more lively.<br>
Memphis and I fortify ourselves with a light meal, and before long, Bismarck approaches us from afar, the delegation of Tulipan representatives trailing behind her.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck：</span><br>
Commander, Memphis, I'd like to introduce you to some people.<br>
<br>
I was surprised by how many delegates had come from Tulipa.<br>
In addition to a military rep whom I'd met only once before to discuss shipgirl-related business, the delegation also included a spokesperson from the Tulipan royal family and several members of their parliament.<br>
The point of this banquet is apparent – to deepen the Iron Blood's ties to me as well as the Tulipans – but Bismarck also has obviously has some other, personal stake in it.<br>
During my conversation with the representatives, I noticed something interesting.<br>
The military reps were very positive about the inclusion of shipgirls in their fleet. Their enthusiasm was only matched – and surpassed – by the royal family's representative.<br>
On the other hand, the members of parliament were certainly polite and formal, yet always maintained an air of distance and prudence.<br>
Despite that, they were always the ones guiding the conversation.<br>
Much unlike the royal family of the Royal Islands, which has a direct say in their navy, the royal family of the Kingdom of Tulipa are little more than figureheads.<br>
Or at the very least, that's how it seems to me.<br>
Perhaps as the Tulipans' plans of expanding their fleet with shipgirls progresses, their royal family would follow the example set by the Royal Islands and regain power by incorporating shipgirls into their dynasty.<br>
Be they kings or congressmen or generals, as long as they treat shipgirls fairly and can guarantee them their due status and power, I have no reason to meddle excessively in their internal affairs.<br>
That is the position that I, as well as the Azur Lane, hold firmly.<br>
Finally, our conversation which was 10% sincerity and 90% lip service came to an end.<br>
The Tulipan delegates set their respective sights on other targets among the guests, and quickly began on their next task.<br>
Once they had dispersed, Memphis compiled a list of tonight's guests.<br>
Meanwhile, Bismarck and I made our way to the conference room she had prepared ahead of time.<br>
All it took was rearranging the layout of the tables and chairs to instantly turn the formal conference room into a quiet, private room.<br>
The room is lit by a gentle light, and there is even food ready. It gives a candlelit dinner type of atmosphere to the place.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
We didn't have much time to speak earlier, so let me say it now: It's a pleasure to meet you again, Bismarck.<br>
How has your health been? Any changes since then?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck：</span><br>
It's been wholly fine. Thank you for your concern.<br>
Now, let us have a toast to the smooth progress of our cooperation with the Kingdom of Tulipa.<br>
Heehee. I hope you'll like this wine.<br>
Don't you think this place is much more conducive to a calm dialogue? It's rather rowdy and hard to have a face-to-face out there.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Yeah, it's a huge step up. Thanks for planning for that. Say, is this the privilege of being the banquet organizer?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck：</span><br>
Indeed, it is. Although, it did mean you had to leave Memphis behind.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Don't worry about her. She'll enjoy the party.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck：</span><br>
That's good to hear. Now, let us get down to business. What do you think of this diplomatic banquet?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I was surprised to see your embassy hosting it. The invitee list had names from factions across the world, too. That was a thrilling sight.<br>
The organizers and participants all seemed overjoyed, and I was pleased to see different factions mingle and laugh. Some had ulterior motives for being here, sure, but none of them showed it.<br>
It felt like I'd gone back in time to before all the fighting began.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck：</span><br>
Is this what you believe our new order should look like?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
...We won't be poised to deal with future threats if we merely go back to an old status quo.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck：</span><br>
Is that so? The last time we met, I knew you had some ideas, but you lacked the conviction you have now.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Let's just say I've been through quite a lot.<br>
Some of them are things you know about, some of them you don't. Some happened here and now, others in a far-off place long ago...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck：</span><br>
Hmm. A very thought-provoking manner of speaking. A good change, I'd say.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Ah, forgive me. I didn't mean to put on airs.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck：</span><br>
Heehee. Let's put the past aside for now and focus on present matters. For instance, the complete ceasefire agreement between the Azur Lane and the Crimson Axis.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
So something finally came of those endless meetings.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck：</span><br>
Things wouldn't have gone this smoothly if you hadn't expertly resolved the crisis of the Sakurans.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I can't claim all the credit. That was the result of us all working together.<br>
From what I've heard, you've finalized the framework and are ironing out the details – correct?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck：</span><br>
Yes, and tonight is the groundwork for that. I've directly spoken to a few factions already.<br>
As of now, all of them are in agreement on two things: Firstly, that the Azur Lane and the Crimson Axis should seek an immediate, complete armistice and an end to all-out war.<br>
Secondly, that the spheres of influence of all factions be restored to fundamentally what they were prior to hosilities beginning.<br>
A formal vote on these two points will be held at the next conference. It should pass without issue.<br>
To elaborate on the ceasefire a bit...<br>
All matters such as restoring old borders, troop transfers, reconstruction, and compensation for war damages will be dealt with by asking the other factions to sign separate supplementary agreements.<br>
The Azur Lane and the Crimson Axis will both provide full support in the facilitation of this process.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Yeah, that's the right approach. At long last, this war is coming to an end.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck：</span><br>
It couldn't have been done without you, the one who brought all the factions together and ensured the success of our joint operations.<br>
I really look forward to seeing how the war's end will change the world.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Thank you for the kind words, but personally, I remain cautiously optimistic about the world's future.<br>
Reforming the Azur Lane... It's a real swamp.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck：</span><br>
We'll take that one step at a time. Rome wasn't built in a day, after all.<br>
On another subject, the Lower Countries Treaty is formally being signed next month. Would you mind being there to personally witness it?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Ah, that treaty...<br>
(By signing it, the three constituents of the Kingdom of Tulipa will pull out of the Iron Blood's shadow and regain its neutral position.)<br>
(Although, when faced with the Sirens, neutrality is a pie in the sky.)<br>
(All it really means is that Tulipa will be treated as an observer state by both the Azur Lane and the Crimson Axis.)<br>
(It will stay that way until a final judgment on the Azur Lane's reformation is passed, after which further discussion will take place.)<br>
Of course. I'd love to see it, assuming circumstances permit me to.<br>
It's our first step into a new age, and a sign of enormous progress for the reformation of the Azur Lane.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck：</span><br>
Let's discuss that matter later.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Right. Let's have another drink. To the Lower Countries Treaty.<br>
Cheers.<br>
<br>
Bismarck and I discussed all sorts of things.<br>
Interfaction affairs, Siren movements, META organizations in other branches, the Iron Blood's nature, climate, and culture, and so on and so on.<br>
All this talking reminded me that behind that tempered exterior of hers lies a woman who is surprisingly eloquent.<br>
Time had completely flown by, and the banquet was approaching its end.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck：</span><br>
Ah, before you leave, there's one last thing I'd like to tell you.<br>
About the Tulipan shipgirl fleet that you came up with and the factions of Europa worked together to build...<br>
There will soon be a chance for you to meet those girls in person.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Come again? But I don't have plans to go to Tulipa anytime soon.<br>
Ah, wait, are you hinting that they'll be present at the signing of the treaty?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck：</span><br>
That, I'm not at liberty to say. You'll see for yourself tomorrow.<br>

<br>
Iris Orthodoxy - Capital<br>
Commander's Office<br>
The next day...<br>
The day following the banquet, an operation briefing from my higher-ups gave an answer to the question Bismarck left me with yesterday.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
I can't believe they're launching the NA Ocean Purification Campaign so soon... What's more, the Tulipans have a fleet participating in the first phase.<br>
They don't have any experience with fighting Sirens. Is this really a good idea?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Everything has to start from somewhere.<br>
The enemies they'll be up against aren't especially threatening. That's perfect for a first battle.<br>
<br>
Following the departure of the Sirens' experimentation division, our world entered a new, post-Siren age.<br>
Unfortunately, the self-detonation of their mainframes was so sudden that it left us with many problems to deal with.<br>
Among them, the biggest and most serious is the NA Ocean.<br>
Since Compiler's mainframe was not self-detonated, but rather destroyed by us, its restructuring program initiated very soon after.<br>
To make matters worse, when Observer issued the self-detonation command, Compiler's mainframe still hadn't come back online, so it never received that order.<br>
If we don't do anything, then it's possible that a new Compiler mainframe will take shape within the NA Ocean within the year. That's a future no one wants.<br>
Therefore, cleaning up Compiler's remaining forces in the area became the top priority between all of the world's factions.<br>
To that end, the Azur Lane and the Crimson Axis formulated a cooperative plan to neutralize the recovering mainframe as well as the lingering Siren forces.<br>
They dubbed this plan, "The NA Ocean Purification Campaign."<br>
The plan originally only included the Royal Navy, the Iris Orthodoxy, the Iron Blood, and the Northern Parliament.<br>
However, the shipgirls of the Kingdom of Tulipa were added to this roster after they demonstrated promising results.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(...And since I had a hand in the creation of their fleet of shipgirls, the task of commanding them fell upon me.)<br>
(The mission itself isn't that difficult. All that needs to be done is eliminate the enemy Mirror Sea sitting near the coast of Tulipa.)<br>
(We'll also be accompanied by a support fleet consisting of vessels from both Tulipa and other factions. That will reduce the danger further.)<br>
(What I'm not sure of yet is whether their inclusion in this mission was an attempt by my superiors to place the Tulipans, or an attempt by Bismarck to train them.)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Commander, the briefing said to "go to the Kingdom of Tulipa, review their fighting capabilities, and determine whether or not support from other factions is needed."<br>
But, well... the Northern Parliament have already stated they'll provide support.<br>
Should we politely turn them down?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
No. Regardless of the impression it gives, I'll gladly accept anything that gives us more leeway in battle.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Understood. When are we leaving?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I want to learn more about the Tulipans before the mission. Let's leave as early as we can.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Okay. How about going there by train tomorrow?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Sounds good.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Alright. I'll contact the Tulipan command and let them know!<br>

Kingdom of Tulipa<br>
Train - Commander's Cabin<br>
The next day...<br>
Memphis quickly arranged everything for me.<br>
The day after I received my mission briefing, I set off to Rotterdam – the Kingdom of Tulipa's second-largest city and its largest port city.<br>
Bumping every now and then, the train ran through cities, grasslands, forests, and hills, until eventually windmills, dikes, and colorful flower fields filled the scenery past the window.<br>
Time passed slowly while my heart was enraptured by the beautiful sights. Before I knew it, the train's whistle sounded and its speed gradually dropped.<br>
After a roughly three-hour journey, I had arrived at my destination – the first stop of my journey to the country.<br>
As soon as Memphis and I disembark the train, a girl carrying the country's flag approaches us.<br>
To her sides are two girls donning the distinct uniforms of the Northern Parliament.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Evertsen：</span><br>
Commander, Memphis, thank you for coming all this way. Welcome to the Kingdom of Tulipa<br>
I am Evertsen, an Admiralen-class destroyer of the Kingdom of Tulipa.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Thank you, Evertsen.<br>
Your country lives up to its name. I was bewitched by the beautiful sights of all the blooming flowers on the way here.<br>
You, too, are quite a stunning representation of this new era for the Tulipan navy. I look forward to seeing you bloom on the battlefield.<br>
(The Tulipans are really doing well with their shipgirls.)<br>
(This aura of nature and greenery must be their trademark trait.)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Evertsen：</span><br>
I promise you that our fleet will live up to your expectations.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Say, who are these other ladies? Kazan and Oleg, correct?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kazan：</span><br>
It's good to see you again, Commander.<br>
She and I are here to assist the Tulipans on orders from Saint Petersburg Base. We'll be under your command for this mission.<br>
It's a pleasure to fight by your side again.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Yeah, we only got to speak briefly during the last battle. This time we can finally take our time and work together comprehensively.<br>
The burden on the Tulipans' fleet will be lessened with you two around. I can't wait to see you in the field.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Oleg：</span><br>
Heheh! My heart already races with anticipation! Do look forward to our stellar performance!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Evertsen：</span><br>
Now then, we're going to drive to an anchorage located on the city's outskirts.<br>
If you have any questions about my homeland, don't be afraid to ask on the way.<br>
The car is waiting for us. Please follow me.<br>
<br>
The car takes us westward. While the gorgeous flower fields and windmills are a given, there are also enormous dikes built along the river. Their presence is not lightly felt.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
These dikes are bigger and taller than ones I've seen anywhere else... They even have buildings attached to them.<br>
And those massive mechanical structures built on top of the banks...<br>
Are those part of the famous flood control system that took the country many years to build?<br>
I didn't expect it to be so large in scope. They've fortified not just the coastal areas, but the banks of inland rivers as well.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Evertsen：</span><br>
Correct. Since our country is on such low elevation, we have not just a long coastline, but also an extensive network of waterways.<br>
As such, we place a bigger emphasis on banks and dams than other countries. We're also in a class of our own when it comes to building them.<br>
When the Sirens first appeared, Tulipa was immediately put in danger as it didn't have shipgirls to protect it.<br>
Instead, we opted to weaponize our embankments.<br>
We devoted our full efforts to up-arming the banks that span our whole kingdom and created a vast and complex defensive installation that can protect our most important positions.<br>
Of course, while it's inadequate for dealing with a proper Siren fleet, it did give us the ability to defend ourselves against threats like stray mass-produced ships and regularly sized air raids.<br>
Now, the banks that protected us from the sea also protect us from the Sirens.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Fortifying your land and concentrating your population where the defenses are the strongest...)<br>
(That's how the Tulipans defended themselves during the war against the Sirens, whilst staying out of the spotlight and having no shipgirls.)<br>
(This strategy has limited effectiveness, but I suppose they had no other choice.)<br>
(Hmm. Speaking of the Sirens...)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Your country's future is looking brighter. The Sirens' experimentation division has been destroyed, and now you have a fleet of shipgirls.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Evertsen：</span><br>
Yes. I believe a better future is ahead of us.<br>
<br>
The sun set and dusk silently enveloped the city as we drove. Soon, we arrived at the harbor, where Tulipan shipgirls and a mass-produced fleet were anchored.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
That building up ahead is sparkling... Was it built just recently?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Evertsen：</span><br>
Yes. While implementing our shipgirl program, some advisors sent by the Northern Parliament informed us that shipgirls do not operate quite like a conventional navy. As such, we decided to construct this new harbor.<br>
It was completed exceptionally quickly thanks to the Northern Parliament's substantial aid.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Oleg：</span><br>
Heheh! As a matter of fact, I contributed a little to its construction.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
I'm somehow not surprised to hear you're already getting involved in their construction projects.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kazan：</span><br>
All we did was help people who needed assistance.<br>
It's not limited to Tulipa, either. Now that the war in the polar regions is over, the Northern Parliament finally has the flexibility to help other countries.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Post-war reconstruction is indeed a crucial task.<br>
There is still fighting to be done, and we need to help each other to get through it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
......<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">De Zeven Provinciën：</span><br>
My apologies for the delay. I am De Zeven Provinciën, light cruiser of the Kingdom of Tulipa.<br>
Commander, Memphis, Kazan, and Oleg – welcome to Nieuwe Haven Naval Base.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Evertsen：</span><br>
Zeven, I told you to be ready to greet the Commander. Why were you late?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">De Zeven Provinciën：</span><br>
I was just filling in our exercise schedule, then all of a sudden the machine started spewing smoke...<br>
So I had to put out the fire... which took quite some time.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Evertsen：</span><br>
Not again... It may be for the best if you simply don't touch any machinery from now on.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">De Zeven Provinciën：</span><br>
But I'm the fleet's flagship! I'm also the harbor's overseer.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Evertsen：</span><br>
Let's save this for another time. More pertinently, what was that about an exercise? I wasn't informed of this.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">De Zeven Provinciën：</span><br>
I wanted it to be a surprise, since I figured the Commander would be interested to see us in action.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Evertsen：</span><br>
A surprise is the last thing we need right now. Our schedule is packed. There's simply no time for a surprise exercise.<br>
Tell me, what do you see anchored in the harbor?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">De Zeven Provinciën：</span><br>
A mass-produced fleet? What of it?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Evertsen：</span><br>
And what about those ships in the front?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">De Zeven Provinciën：</span><br>
I mean... they're our riggings.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Evertsen：</span><br>
Exactly. They've been fully deployed in the harbor in vessel form in order to conduct inspections and maintenance.<br>
How, pray tell, do you expect to hold an exercise while that's happening?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">De Zeven Provinciën：</span><br>
With... magic?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Evertsen：</span><br>
......<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">De Zeven Provinciën：</span><br>
...Is that not going to work?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Evertsen：</span><br>
No. It's not going to work.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">De Zeven Provinciën：</span><br>
Are you sure? Is it super-duper not going to work?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Evertsen：</span><br>
It's not going to work! Period!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">De Zeven Provinciën：</span><br>
Aww... Okay, I understand.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kazan & Oleg：</span><br>
......<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
......<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Zeven, Evertsen, may I suggest saving confidential matters until AFTER we've entered the base?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">De Zeven Provinciën：</span><br>
Oh, right! Forgive me! Please come with me – I'll show you to the reception party!<br>

Kingdom of Tulipa<br>
Nieuwe Haven Naval Base<br>
After the party, Memphis and I were curious about the Tulipans' dam defense system, so went to the nearest one to have a look.<br>
Thanks to my status and position, we made it there without much hassle.<br>
After a short while, we were strolling on the embankment, made of concrete and rebar and covered with steel armor.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
In terms of structural strength, it looks on par with our Panama Canal fortifications.<br>
Even though this is just a place to walk, not a strategic location.<br>
I suppose Tulipa was very serious about it when they built this dam defense system.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Yeah. You can even see signs of repairs all over the place. Sirens must've hit this place several times in the past.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
The Sirens' Mirror Sea is pretty close to the coastline. I'll bet that's where they attacked from.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Communicator：</span><br>
BEEP BEEP!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Hm? Who's calling this late in the–<br>
<br>
The light fades, and the familiar sight of the night sky unfolds before me.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
I called you in advance this time.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Not with the best timing, sadly. I was just with Memphis and–<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
I know. You were taking a walk on the embankment.<br>
Don't worry. I made it so the time flows at a ratio of 360:1 this time, so this won't take more than a few seconds.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Is there some sort of issue with Marco Polo?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
No, there's just something I wanted you to know about your next move.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
You mean my incursion in the Mirror Sea off the Tulipan coast?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
Yes. How much did they tell you in your briefing?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Upper command said it's Compiler's forward operating base for keeping an eye on and blockading the Kingdom of Tulipa.<br>
Ever since Compiler's defeat, the base's defense systems have remained offline, and the fleet within it has remained idle. It's the perfect place for the Tulipan shipgirls to get some fighting experience.<br>
Let me guess... our intel is wrong, isn't it?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
Heehee.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Then how much of it is wrong?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
That's not an FOB. It's a weapons test site previously overseen by Omitter. It was used to develop and test all kinds of new weaponry.<br>
The defense system works like normal, and the test programs inside are still running, despite the detonation of her mainframe.<br>
So, how much of your intel do you think is wrong?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
...Sounds like our intel department will need a lot more time to figure out the experimentation division's structure.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
Don't worry, that's exactly what I'm here to help with.<br>
I got the data on their new weapons from Observer. I'll send it to you later.<br>
You'll need much more than two Tulipan shipgirls to deal with that place. It's really lucky that the Northern Parliament sent those reinforcements.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
And to think I was going to split the fleet in two so they could gain more experience...<br>
You saved my skin with this intel. Thank you.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
No need to thank me.<br>
Well, that's everything from me. Enjoy your nightly stroll.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Hmh...<br>
Hrrmmmh...<br>
<br>
When I can see again, my vision is filled with Memphis' face.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
You blanked out for no reason for a minute there, Commander.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I, uh... My mind just wandered for a bit.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Your mind wandered. Right. You weren't talking to someone?<br>
It was her again, wasn't it? Helena META.<br>
Gosh, does she even know how dangerous it is for her to do this?!<br>
What if she did it while you were driving, huh? Or in the middle of crossing a road?!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
It's fine. She knows when not to do it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Let's hope she never misjudges her timing, then.<br>
So, what did she tell you?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
It was about the–<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Shh. Wait. Someone's coming.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">De Zeven Provinciën：</span><br>
...Commander? Memphis?<br>
I wasn't expecting to come across you here. Are you out on a walk as well?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Excuse me? I radioed the base and said we were going out.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">De Zeven Provinciën：</span><br>
Uhh, well... My communicator did receive a message, but as soon as I picked it up, it stopped working...<br>
And then... smoke started coming out of it...<br>
So Evertsen brought in the technical team to assist...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
......<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">De Zeven Provinciën：</span><br>
It's no big deal! Luckily, I stumbled upon you out here!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Are you anxious about your upcoming battle, Zeven?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">De Zeven Provinciën：</span><br>
...You see right through me, Commander. Yes, you're correct.<br>
I have done lots of training and I have the essentials of combat carved into my memory, but even so...<br>
This will be my first real battle as a representative of my country, and I feel so nervous about being the flagship...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
That's normal. Nothing is easy the first time around.<br>
I know what you're capable of. You'll be fine as long as you fight like you did during your training.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">De Zeven Provinciën：</span><br>
Okay! Thank you for the comforting words, Commander! I'll strive to do my best!<br>
Oh, one more thing! My favorite park lies just at the end of this embankment. Would you like to come see it with me?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I wish I could, but time is short. The mission is taking place the day after tomorrow and I need to get back and start preparing.<br>
We can certainly go and see the park after we've won.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">De Zeven Provinciën：</span><br>
In two days, then! Why don't we walk back to the base together?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
...Right. Let's head back.<br>

<br>
Sea Near the Kingdom of Tulipa<br>
Joint Fleet<br>
Two days later...<br>
On the day of the Tulipan fleet's first battle, their flag flutters in the gentle sea breeze.<br>
Zeven and Evertsen deploy their rigging and set sail first.<br>
They're followed by my command ship, which is then followed by the imposing mass-produced Tulipan fleet.<br>
Kazan and Oleg have joined me on the command ship so that the stars of the day can keep the spotlight to themselves.<br>
That said, though the parade is flashy, it is a short affair.<br>
Not long after we leave the port, Zeven and Evertsen put away their rigging and join the Northern Parliament's mass-produced fleet waiting close by.<br>
The fleet changes to a circular formation centered around the command ship, and we make way for our destination.<br>
Shortly later...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Oleg：</span><br>
Kazan, is it just me, or is the Commander a little too cautious?<br>
The experimental division's big shots are gone. I bet Sirens would be easy pickings for our fleet.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kazan：</span><br>
I'm sure the Commander has good reasons.<br>
Besides, you've seen how nervous the Tulipan girls are.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Oleg：</span><br>
Oh... Yeah, now that you mention it...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">De Zeven Provinciën：</span><br>
It will work out... It won't work out... It will work out... It won't work out...<br>
Aww... This is no good. Let me try again...<br>
It will work out... It won't work out...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Evertsen：</span><br>
Keep pulling out petals, and that wand won't have any flowers left.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">De Zeven Provinciën：</span><br>
Ah... Th-then I'll just grow more...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Evertsen：</span><br>
Not a good use of your powers.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">De Zeven Provinciën：</span><br>
O-okay, I'll just go get more flowers...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Evertsen：</span><br>
That's not the problem – ugh, forget it. I'm wasting my breath.<br>
If you really can't settle down, might I suggest a round of patrols?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">De Zeven Provinciën：</span><br>
Oh! That's a good idea. Shall we go now?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Wait a minute, I heard that!<br>
You're acting as part of a fleet. No individual action without approval!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Evertsen：</span><br>
I'm sorry. I guess I didn't think things through.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Oleg：</span><br>
Okay, they're getting TOO tense.<br>
This isn't normal... It's almost shipgirl instinct to maintain discipline in battle, isn't it?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kazan：</span><br>
Are they under too much pressure? Or could it be... because of their special Wisdom Cubes?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Oleg：</span><br>
Aha! That must be it!<br>
After the investigation of the Arcana Sanctum, everyone's Wisdom Cubes had changed in subtle ways.<br>
Their structure is still stable, but they're extra active. They were there for a long time, after all.<br>
So we'll get to see the Tulipan fleet using the power of those cubes... I'm getting even more excited to see them in battle!<br>
<br>
Commander's Vessel - Command Deck<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
*sigh*... These people are such a mess.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Don't worry. There's still time until we enter the danger zone, so let them get acclimated.<br>
Weren't you like this during your first operation, too?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Goodness, no!<br>
I was calm and collected, and I sunk countless mass-produced Siren ships to boot.<br>
Why, my heroic acts left an unforgettable impression on everyone there.<br>
...What? If you don't believe me, then go ask Honolulu.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
That's not it. I'm just thinking about how time flies.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Hm? Are you calling me old now?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Not at all.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Hmph. We shipgirls are forever young!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Communicator：</span><br>
BEEP BEEP!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Whoops, there we go.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Commander, we have intel reports.<br>
Our route remains clear. If we continue at our current pace, we should enter the Mirror Sea in approximately 45 minutes.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Time to get into formation, then.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Communicator：</span><br>
BEEP BEEP!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Evertsen, can you hear me?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Evertsen：</span><br>
Evertsen speaking. Commander, what are your orders?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Let me ask one thing first. Have Tulipan communication devices been prepared to deal with the jamming in Mirror Seas?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Evertsen：</span><br>
I'm sorry... You won't like the answer.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Oleg, what of the Northern Parliament's?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Oleg：</span><br>
It's possible in theory, but I can't make any promises. Sometimes, they fail.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Understood. All units, listen carefully.<br>
In forty-five minutes, we will enter the Mirror Sea. Communications with the outside will most likely be cut off. This is expected – remain calm.<br>
Memphis will give you orders to adjust your formations, so listen to her and prepare for battle.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Everyone：</span><br>
Roger!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Things are just like they used to be. It's almost disconcerting.)<br>
(I should ask Helena META if she has any tech she can share with us...)<br>
(Worst case, I can have her reverse engineer it at the Sea of Stars. I doubt she'll say no to that.)<br>

<br>
KABOOOM!<br>
The Tulipan fleet is engaging the enemy.<br>
Shell after shell loaded with fury ignites one hideous foe after the next.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Evertsen：</span><br>
The Sirens are ablaze.<br>
All the blood shed since the destruction of our kingdom's fleet... can be seen in these flames.<br>
We finally did it... The Kingdom of Tulipa finally did it...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">De Zeven Provinciën：</span><br>
It's not time yet to be overcome with emotion, Evertsen.<br>
Our journey has only just begun. We only planted our flag in this ocean mere moments ago.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Evertsen：</span><br>
You're right... This is only the beginning.<br>
Our new future... begins now.<br>
<br>
KABOOOM!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">De Zeven Provinciën：</span><br>
Enemy reinforcements incoming.<br>
We'll lead our mass-produced fleet in and pincer them. Eliminate them as quickly as possible.<br>
Let us show them our might. Our first battle must end in victory!<br>
<br>
<br>
KABOOOM!<br>
As time went by, the Tulipans conquered their initial awkwardness and gradually became accustomed to fighting.<br>
The advantage we had since the very start had developed into an overwhelming superiority.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Mirror Seas used to be so dangerous, and now we can just bulldoze through them.<br>
And our fighting force isn't even first-rate...<br>
Seems like we've accomplished the transition from quantity to quality.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
You realized that just now?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
I've had an inkling for a while. Data doesn't lie.<br>
It's just that the enemies have been getting stronger at the same as we did. Chances to really feel our growth were surprisingly rare.<br>
This one time is different. They're still weak while we've changed greatly.<br>
I estimate we'll complete this mission in under 12 hours, including time spent searching for hostiles.<br>
If we hurry back to the harbor, we should even make it in time for lunch.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(True. The mission is proceeding very smoothly, and it looks like the Tulipans got into the swing of things.)<br>
(That said, no report is better than seeing something with your own eyes. There is something special about these girls.)<br>
(The ivies appearing out of thin air, this everpresent feeling of nature... Could this be a type of cognitive materialization?)<br>
(Their strange powers and these unusual phenomena must have something to do with those unique Wisdom Cubes.)<br>
(After my trip to the Arcana Sanctum, there was an unidentified but positive change in all the Wisdom Cubes the Northern Parliament had at the time.)<br>
(They developed all kinds of theories to try to explain the origin of this phenomenon.)<br>
(Some say the cause was the Arcana Sanctum's unique environment, while others say my Wisdom Cube aptitude had that effect. Others, still, say it was a combination of both of those.)<br>
(Whatever the case, that phenomenon hasn't reoccurred since.)<br>
(That's not all. Whenever new shipgirls are born in the Northern Parliament, they use those unique Wisdom Cubes as part of the process.)<br>
(Despite this different procedure, those shipgirls don't display any differences. It's as though they did it using regular Wisdom Cubes.)<br>
(In contrast, the Tulipan shipgirls exhibit astonishing changes.)<br>
(I hope we'll be able to figure out the root cause...)<br>
(Because if we do, we might be able to further raise the strength floor of our world!)<br>
<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Communicator：</span><br>
BEEP BEEP!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kazan：</span><br>
Commander, the Northern Parliament fleet has finished its elimination mission.<br>
We're now starting to surround the Mirror Sea's central control tower from the southwest. Expected to be in the designated position within an hour.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">De Zeven Provinciën：</span><br>
Likewise, Commander, the Tulipan fleet has completed its own elimination mission. We are currently surrounding the tower from the southeast.<br>
We'll begin an all-out attack once we link up with the Northern Parliament's fleet!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Fantastic work. Keep it up.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Communicator：</span><br>
BEEP BEEP!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
......<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
What's wrong, Commander? You look displeased, despite how well things are going.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Remember back at the embankment, right as Zeven approached us? I was going to tell you that Omitter used this Mirror Sea to test new weapons.<br>
I heard it straight from Helena, so I have no reason to doubt its veracity.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Huh? But we haven't seen anything you could call a new weapon so far...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
That's what worries me.<br>
There should be one, so where is it?<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=The Tulipans' First Battle - 2|选项=7|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<br>
KABOOOM!<br>
The battle for the central control tower wasn't particularly tough.<br>
All resistance to our overwhelming firepower proved futile, and the tower that maintained the Mirror Sea was destroyed very quickly.<br>
The abnormal weather and terrain within the Mirror Sea gradually faded away, and soon, the jamming that impeded our communications disappeared, and we started receiving messages from the outside again.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Wow, that's a lot of unread messages.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
...Commander, I have terrible news.<br>
Not long after we departed, a Siren fleet launched an attack on the Tulipan coast!<br>
<br>
My bad premonition came true.<br>
Helena META's intel was correct – this place was indeed a Siren testing site for new weapons, and it had been operating as normal.<br>
Apparently, as soon as I took the fleet in to destroy the Mirror Sea, its commanding AI sent forth a fleet armed with new weapons and attacked the now-defenseless Tulipan coast.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">De Zeven Provinciën：</span><br>
Scheming to strike at us even if it meant sacrificing itself... How cowardly!<br>
Our dam defense system is engaging the Siren fleet, and it's now on the brink of falling apart...<br>
Commander, we have to retreat posthaste!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Hold up. While we did destroy the machine sustaining the Mirror Sea, there are still Sirens in the general area. Our mission isn't over yet.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">De Zeven Provinciën：</span><br>
Be that as it may, the enemy is attacking our country directly!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
I know, but we can't just leave. This is a joint operation between the Azur Lane and the Crimson Axis.<br>
And as operation participants, we have to prioritize the mission.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">De Zeven Provinciën：</span><br>
Even if our country is burning?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Believe in yourself, believe in your compatriots defending the dam, and believe in the Commander.<br>
You have to keep cool no matter how dire things get.<br>
Remember, we have the edge in firepower. As long as each of us carries out their role, the Commander will always lead us to the best result.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">De Zeven Provinciën：</span><br>
*sigh*...<br>
You're right. Forgive me, Commander. I lost my composure.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Since the situation has changed, we'll have to redeploy our forces.<br>
We've successfully eliminated the Sirens within the Mirror Sea and taken out its control tower.<br>
However, there are still hostiles in the area, so our mission isn't finished just yet.<br>
While it's true we have to deal with them, not ALL of us need to stay here.<br>
A part of our force will split off and head to the coast.<br>
Zeven, assemble a fleet consisting of you, Eversten, and your mass-produced ships. I'll bring my command vessel and provide support.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">De Zeven Provinciën：</span><br>
Thank you, Commander! I'll start regrouping at once!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Kazan, you'll take command of the NP fleet and stay here to mop up the enemy. Don't let a single one get away.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kazan：</span><br>
Got it. It will be done.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I'll request backup from the Royal Navy fleet nearby. They should help us clean up this area.<br>
Once the area is clear, immediately return to Tulipa and provide backup.<br>
This battle must be finished quickly and conclusively.<br>
There are your orders. Eliminate all enemies before Tulipa suffers further casualties!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Everyone：</span><br>
Roger!<br>
<br>
<br>
KABOOOM!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Grenville：</span><br>
Commander! Haven't seen you since the NA counterattack operation!<br>
Royal Navy destroyer Grenville, head of the search-and-destroy fleet, reporting in!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hardy：</span><br>
The battle hasn't yet resulted in significant casualties. It seems we've arrived at the perfect time!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kazan：</span><br>
We're done mopping up the stragglers. I'll join up with you and the Royal Navy soon, Commander.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Oleg：</span><br>
Whoa-ho! Those must be the biggest foes I've ever seen!<br>
Heheh... I'd love to pick their wreckages apart!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hero：</span><br>
What're we waiting for? Get 'em! Chaaarge!<br>
<br>
<br>
The fleet failed on at full speed, and soon the Tulipan coastline lit up by cannon fire came into view.<br>
While there was fighting all across the dam defense system, it didn't seem as disastrous as was assumed.<br>
The defense line was holding, and the battle was going far better than expected.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tirpitz：</span><br>
Leipzig, Nürnberg, coordinate with the Tulipan defensive installations and destroy the enemy's vanguard force.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leipzig & Nürnberg：</span><br>
- Yes, ma'am! - Roger!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tirpitz：</span><br>
Spee, don't focus solely on their biggest units. Our goal isn't swift elimination, it's to repel them from the coastline and keep structural damage to a minimum.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Admiral Graf Spee：</span><br>
Okay... I'll bear that in mind.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Avrora：</span><br>
Oh. It seems the Iron Blood had the same idea as us.<br>
Murmansk, Grozny, we're going to assist the Iron Blood's fleet and push the frontline back into the sea.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Murmansk & Grozny：</span><br>
- Roger, roger. - Let's beat the crap out of 'em!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">De Zeven Provinciën：</span><br>
Ally reinforcements on the coastline!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Evertsen：</span><br>
Thank goodness. They're still holding out!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Those are the domestic Iron Blood and Northern Parliament defense fleets not participating in the operation.<br>
They're actually going out of their way to assist...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
A good sign of things to come. It means all our hard work up to this point wasn't for nothing.<br>
There may just be hope for the Azur Lane's reformation.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Yeah!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Then there are THOSE things over there... They must be Omitter's latest weapon.<br>
According to intel, those are Sphyrnidae, super-dreadnought-class eradicators.<br>
We have to defeat them to complete this mission in any real sense.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">De Zeven Provinciën：</span><br>
Commander, the Tulipan fleet awaits your orders!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Right. Coordinate with the coastal defense forces and allied fleets and eliminate the enemy!<br>
<br>
<br>
At long last, peace and quiet returns to the shore.<br>
The first light of dawn shines down, and a new day begins.<br>

<br>
Kingdom of Tulipa<br>
Nieuwe Haven Naval Base<br>
Two days later...<br>
Across the land scorched by fire, new life springs forth in droves.<br>
After less than a day of examination and statistics, the Kingdom of Tulipa immediately started repairing its dam defense system.<br>
Meanwhile, in the corner of the busy construction site...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Oleg：</span><br>
Whoooa! They're growing! I can see the growth with my own two eyes!<br>
They're getting bigger and bigger, longer and longer...<br>
They can even lift those stacks of steel plates with ease!<br>
Fabulous! Simply beautiful!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Evertsen：</span><br>
Are you satisfied?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Oleg：</span><br>
Satisfied and then some!<br>
Ah, sorry, it just hit me that I made you put on a show for my sake.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Evertsen：</span><br>
Don't be sorry. I'm just doing what has to be done anyway.<br>
It makes an incredible amount of sense to put life and nature to use in reconstruction.<br>
Our dam defense system is very important and directly linked to our country's safety. As a Tulipan, I should naturally give reconstruction efforts my all.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Oleg：</span><br>
Well spoken! Ah, that makes me think...<br>
Heheh... Mwahahaha...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Evertsen：</span><br>
What's so funny?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Oleg：</span><br>
Nothing, I just remembered something joyous!<br>
You've shown me the wonders of biotechnology. Soon, I will show you the staggering might of INDUSTRIAL technology!<br>
We defended these embankments together, so the Northern Parliament should also have a role in its reconstruction!<br>
In fact, the giant construction machines I requested will be arriving by transport ship at this harbor today!<br>
Hahahaha! Together, we'll rebuild it stronger, bigger, and better than before!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Have to say, I'm impressed by how the Tulipans rebuild.<br>
<br>
Admiring the impassioned workers at the construction site from afar, Memphis and I walk along the embankment.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
On another note, I heard the Sea of Stars sent a request for a few of those special Wisdom Cubes for research purposes.<br>
Do you think the Northern Parliament will approve it, though?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Probably. Since the Tulipan fleet already demonstrated its unique powers, there's no reason to hide the Cubes anymore.<br>
(Although, I wonder if the Sea of Stars will be able to research anything until they figure out how the Cubes work.)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Communicator：</span><br>
BEEP BEEP!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
It's Bismarck. She has many things to talk about, including but not limited to the mission's results.<br>
I'll go and take a walk over there.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck：</span><br>
I heard you achieved another stellar victory, Commander.<br>
Now that the Tulipan fleet has a win to its name, the going should get easier for them.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
While the mission was a success, I wouldn't call it flawless.<br>
Despite our overwhelming military advantage, Tulipa still suffered damage in this battle.<br>
Damage which happened despite my learning in advance that our intel was wrong and revising the plan accordingly.<br>
If it hadn't been me at the helm, or if I hadn't realized the intel was wrong, then who knows how the battle would've gone?<br>
Even with the Sirens' experimentation division gone, we still can't ignore the threat that the remaining Sirens pose.<br>
I think we've come to let our guard down after winning too much.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck：</span><br>
You're right. The Sirens are no less dangerous than before.<br>
This direct attack on the Tulipan mainland serves as a warning for those of us who've become complacent.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
...You know, I just remembered that the Sirens and the Iron Blood used to have a handful of Mirror Seas for cooperative testing purposes.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck：</span><br>
Please. That's in the past.<br>
We live in a new age. A unified age where people help one another.<br>
A better age. Wouldn't you agree?<br>
<br>
As I walk aimlessly while on a call with Bismarck, I suddenly realize that I've arrived at the park Zeven mentioned a few days back.<br>
I spot Memphis waving in the distance. She points at the communicator, then at a gazebo nearby.<br>
Wrapping up my chat with Bismarck, I go up to the gazebo.<br>
There, I find Zeven waiting for me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">De Zeven Provinciën：</span><br>
Commander. What a coincidence! I wasn't expecting to meet you here.<br>
How do you like the park?<br>
You'll find the beautiful sights of Tulipa in many more places than just here. Since the mission is over now, and you find yourself here, why not stay in the country and relax for a while?<br>
I and my countrymen all would love to have you here.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Well... The plan is for me to return to the Iris Orthodoxy tomorrow.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
For another all-but-pointless meeting?<br>
You've been working like a dog lately. It's time you took some time off.<br>
Heck, I can write your vacation request for you. There's no need to burden yourself with that.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
You say that, but my work is important.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
If it really is important, they can call you about it. You can do it remotely!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Alright, if you insist...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Glad you agree! Time for a well-earned vacation!<br>
Zeven, let's put together a schedule!<br>
<br>
The two of them start merrily chatting away about a holiday schedule for me.<br>
As I savor the joy of temporarily getting away from my work and the excitement of a vacation, I take one last look at my communicator.<br>
That's when I notice there is a single unread message.<br>
The sender – Queen Elizabeth. It arrived at nearly the same time as my call from Bismarck.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(From Elizabeth? Why would she message me at this time?)<br>
(Maybe it's a "congratulations on your mission completion" message? One of her fleets DID participate.)<br>
(Only one way to find out...)<br>
<br>
I open the message. As expected, it does start with some congratulations, and even briefly touches on the developments on the front the Royal Navy has been assigned.<br>
What comes after that, though, hits me like a freight train.<br>
Queen Elizabeth META and Miss D returned safely to Camelot. They were successful in their whale hunt.<br>
The catch is that although they have the whale, Miss D has forgotten how to use it.<br>
Due to the exceptional familiarity Miss D showed toward me, and the astonishing cooperation between her and Helena META in the Martyrium, she is now inviting me to come to the Royal Islands.<br>
Along with Helena META. She hopes that, together, we'll be able to shed some light on this whale of theirs.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(An invitation I can't refuse...)<br>
(I'll have to contact Helena sometime today and start preparing in advance for a visit to the Royal Islands.)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Commander! How does the Tulipan capital sound for our first destination?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Err...<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Memphis...</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：About that vacation...</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
...Why the grim look?<br>
What happened? Show me that!<br>
......<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
So... yeah.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
......<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
We'll accompany Grenville's fleet to the Royal Islands tomorrow.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
No.. My vacation... My vacation plans...<br>
ELIZABEEEEETH!!!<br>
<br>
Toward Tulipa's Seas - End<br>
