The Queen's Ordinary Day<br>
<br>
1.An Ordinary Morning <br>
The sun rose over the Royal Islands on a quiet yet busy morning.<br>
Birds chirped from atop their tree branches, their song flowing across the empty streets below.<br>
Sunlight filtered through the curtains of the Queen's castle, marking the beginning of another wonderful day.<br>
Royal Islands - Queen Elizabeth's bedchamber<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Zzzzz...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Newcastle：</span><br>
Your Majesty, it's time to wake up. Please, Your Majesty.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Zzz... Five more minutes, Bel... Zzzzz...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Newcastle：</span><br>
You said the same thing five minutes ago. No work is going to get done if you stay in bed all day...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Nnngh... Oh, it's you, Newcastle... That's right, Bel isn't here right now...<br>
*yaaawn*... Okay, time to get up!<br>
<br>
Some time later, in Elizabeth's office...<br>
After getting dressed and washing her face, the little queen sat down at her work desk.<br>
Cup of morning tea in hand, she went through reports from her subjects all around the world.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">King George V：</span><br>
Per Your Majesty's orders, we sent replicas to our exhibit at the World Expo. As predicted, several of the originals have since gone missing.<br>
The data we gathered suggests META involvement, though the specific readings do not match anything we have on record. Furthermore, we are unable to trace how these infiltrations took place.<br>
Moreover, sporadic Siren attacks were detected around the same timeframe the exhibition items were stolen.<br>
While there may be some connection between the two events, we do not have any hard evidence to link them as of yet.<br>
For the time being, all we can do is continue investigating.<br>
I shall inform you if anything new comes to light.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Hmm... The Sirens targeting the World Expo was well within my expectations.<br>
But, what does this unidentified META want with our Royal Islands?<br>
Their motivations truly make no sense to me – and that goes for both the Sirens and the META.<br>
(We've dealt several blows to the Sirens, both in the NA Ocean and through Friedrich's ploy. We've also made contact with certain META ships through Camelot.)<br>
(So why is all of this happening now? How are they attacking us while hardly leaving any evidence behind?)<br>
(I have a bad feeling about this... If there are META ships colluding with the Sirens, that could spell disaster.)<br>
(Even the Ashes are not a monolithic faction. It isn't inconceivable that they would have members among them working with the Sirens.)<br>
(...In any case, I can't just sit around and wait for reports to come in. Think, which parties might be interested in getting their hands on cultural artifacts?)<br>
Newcastle, summon Gloucester. I want a report on Sardegna's and Iris Libre's recent movements.<br>

The Queen's Ordinary Day<br>
<br>
2.The Usual Lunch <br>
Elizabeth's Office - Noon<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Newcastle：</span><br>
Your Majesty, it's almost lunchtime. Would you like to eat?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Let me finish what I'm doing first. Give me thirty minutes.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Newcastle：</span><br>
As you will. I shall wait until then.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gloucester：</span><br>
Your Majesty, here's the report you asked for.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Finally. Let's make this quick.<br>
Tell me your most important findings.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gloucester：</span><br>
Of course.<br>
Starting with Iris Libre, Richelieu's campaign in Africa is proceeding smoothly.<br>
Her fleet has been steadily growing in strength and is expected to become a considerable force in the near future.<br>
Meanwhile, the Vichya Dominion has been abandoning their territories one by one and redeploying their forces in mainland Europa, suggesting a change of strategy.<br>
As for the Tribunal, we've learned that several of its members have left the continent of Europa to partake in covert operations.<br>
However, due to the organisation's secretive nature, we've been unable to determine their means or objectives, and need to remain vigilant.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Are there any reports of the Tribunal attempting to reach out to Iris Libre?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gloucester：</span><br>
Not as of yet. However, as both the Vichya Dominion and Iris Libre have set up pavilions at the World Expo, it is highly likely the two parties have interacted in secret.<br>
Sheffield may know something, as she is on the scene.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
I take it she's maintaining the appearance of a neutral party?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gloucester：</span><br>
That's correct. Furthermore, we have not seen any movements from the Holy See in response.<br>
If any new information comes to light, I will inform you at once.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
I appreciate it. Speaking of which, what information do you have on Sardegna?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gloucester：</span><br>
To the best of my knowledge–<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Wait. On second thought, let's ask Illustrious instead. She's there in person.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gloucester：</span><br>
Certainly, Your Majesty. I will contact her right now.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Communicator：</span><br>
......<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Illustrious, do you hear me?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
Your Majesty? Yes, I hear you loud and clear. How may I be of service?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
I want a word with you. Where are you right now?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
I'm in the restaurant of the Royal Navy's pavilion. I'm afraid you caught me in the middle of dinner.<br>
Please do forgive me. I will head to my lodging and call you back at once.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
No need. I just wanted to know how things are over there.<br>
I presume the Sardegna incident has been dealt with. Has everything gone well since?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
Indeed it has. There have been no further problems so far.<br>
Sardegna has done an excellent job maintaining order and keeping the event on schedule. In general, the mood here is quite festive.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Glad to hear it. I suppose that makes things easier for you.<br>
What about Veneto and Littorio? Have you seen them?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
I have, both during the opening ceremony and a few more times after that when they paid a visit to our pavilion.<br>
I saw Littorio as recently as yesterday when she attended our banquet.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Alright. Finally, have you had a chance to speak to Marco Polo, the organiser of the expo?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
Now that you mention it... No, I've not caught as much as a glance of her.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Hmm. Interesting.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
Oh, I have one important thing to report, Your Majesty.<br>
It seems the Dragon Empery delegation will be leaving the World Expo ahead of time, though I'm not sure if they're planning to return home just yet.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Hmm... Why would they do something like that?<br>
Illustrious, when is the closing ceremony of the World Expo? They might know something we don't.<br>

The Queen's Ordinary Day<br>
<br>
3.Desserts After Lunch <br>
Castle Training Grounds - Noon<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Monarch：</span><br>
Let's see you parry this!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vanguard：</span><br>
Hah! Not bad, but not quick enough to land a hit on me!<br>
Now it's MY turn!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Monarch：</span><br>
You may be quicker, but I've figured out your fighting style!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vanguard：</span><br>
You blocked that?! Tsk... But you won't block–<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Monarch：</span><br>
Hold it, Vanguard! We are being watched.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vanguard：</span><br>
Watched? Actually, yeah, I've been feeling that too...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Monarch：</span><br>
I sense it from over there. Look. Is that... Her Majesty?<br>
She's tiptoeing along the tree line. I can only assume she's trying to sneak out of the castle.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vanguard：</span><br>
Well, she can't sneak past us.<br>
Let's go talk to her. We'll call this duel a draw.<br>
Your Majesty! Do you require help in any–<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
No, I don't! I'm just passing through!<br>
Get back to your training. Don't waste your time worrying about me!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vanguard：</span><br>
I'm afraid I can't do that, Your Majesty. It is my job to protect you, and to that end, I must know where you're going.<br>
If I may ask, why are you sneaking around? If you're going on an outing, you need only tell me so.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Erp! Well, um...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Newcastle：</span><br>
There you are, Your Majesty.<br>
Vanguard, you came at just the right time. I believe Her Majesty intends to leave for Scapa Flow by herself.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Newcastleee!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vanguard：</span><br>
Scapa Flow?! Your Majesty, you cannot be serious!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
What's wrong with that? Plus, lower your voice already!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vanguard：</span><br>
With all due respect, it wasn't long ago when you reprimanded Monarch for the same reckless behaviour!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Monarch：</span><br>
......<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Fine, fine! If I must be held to the same standard, then you two come with me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vanguard：</span><br>
Yes, Your Majesty! Monarch, get yourself equipped.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
There's no time to waste. Catch up if you're coming along!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vanguard：</span><br>
Your Majesty, wait! Please give us a minute!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
I've already given you one! I will not be late on account of you!<br>

The Queen's Ordinary Day<br>
<br>
4.A Stroll Through the Courtyard <br>
Mirror Sea - Camelot<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Repulse META：</span><br>
Hey! If it isn't Her Majesty.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Renown META：</span><br>
It is an honour to see you again, Your Majesty and company.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Yes, it's been a while. Is everything ready?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Renown META：</span><br>
Yes, Your Majesty. Once the designated time arrives, the rest is up to you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Got it. You two, follow me to the control station.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vanguard：</span><br>
Your Majesty, may I ask what you intend to do? Are you going to use the Gate to teleport to another Mirror Sea?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Nothing of the sort. We can't risk drawing the attention of that Bon Homme Richard girl by activating the gate again.<br>
Until we've completely ruled out any possibility of danger, use of the Gate is off-limits.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Renown META：</span><br>
A wise decision, Your Majesty.<br>
Whatever that monster taking the form of Bon Homme Richard really is, leading her to this branch would prove catastrophic.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vanguard：</span><br>
That much is clear. We could barely even hold her off last time, and that was with outside assistance.<br>
Hmm... But, we're not the only ones researching translocation through Singularities, right? If Iron Blood doesn't stop their experimentation as well...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
I've contacted the Commander to hopefully get them to stop. None of us can afford to make any rash moves while we don't know what we're up against.<br>
But, that doesn't mean we can't use the Singularities at all. Today, we're here for a completely different purpose.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Monarch：</span><br>
That being...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Establishing a communication hub through space-time.<br>
Instead of creating one large energy signature by opening the Singularity for fleet travel, we'll basically poke holes in a bunch of different Mirror Seas for data transmission only.<br>
This way, that Richard girl won't be able to trace us back to a single point of origin, assuming she even picks up on our minuscule energy footprint in the first place.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Monarch：</span><br>
That's all well and good, but what even is your goal?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Simply stated, searching for friends.<br>
If the Ashes can make allies, there must be SOMEONE out there willing to ally with us.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Monarch：</span><br>
How do you know it's going to work?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
I don't, but we'll never know until we try.<br>
What's the alternative? Continuing to play along with the Reenactments? Fighting amongst ourselves forever?<br>
To hell with that. I will not sign away the lives of my subjects in an unending, unchanging war.<br>
And, neither will the Commander.<br>
Protecting our azure lanes is our duty as shipgirls. Fulfilling it requires ending this war and ushering in a lasting peace.<br>
And in order to defeat those who would make an enemy of peace itself, we must have a full hand of cards to play.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Monarch：</span><br>
Your countermeasures are as magnificent as your ideals, Your Majesty.<br>
If all goes well... I can hardly imagine how bright the future ahead of us will be.<br>
Hmph, if only the power-obsessed leaders of Iron Blood shared your same vision.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Despite how things may appear, the situation is not so black-and-white. I believe we are ultimately working towards the same goal.<br>
Every faction has its own strengths and weaknesses, as well as interests and ideals. Iron Blood is no different.<br>
We are capable of things they are not, as is the Sakura Empire capable of things the Eagle Union is not.<br>
We may all have been dealt different cards, but all we can do is play our cards to the best of our abilities. That is true, regardless of which side of the table one may sit at.<br>
...Ahem. At least, that's what my servant would say.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Monarch：</span><br>
I suppose all of us, across all factions, have been forging our futures in secret.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
You could say that. Granted, I, too, was clueless once.<br>
Clueless of many things. The nature of the Reenactments, the Singularities, the Crimson Axis, and even the Commander–<br>
I could not tell good from evil, friend from foe.<br>
To be honest, I don't even know how this plan will pan out. We have neither the knowledge nor the technology to predict that.<br>
But one thing is for certain – this is better than doing nothing, isn't it?<br>
...It's almost time now.<br>
Hurry up onto the platform. We've got work to do.<br>

The Queen's Ordinary Day<br>
<br>
5.Afternoon Tea <br>
Mirror Sea - Camelot<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Repulse META：</span><br>
*yaaawn*... Still nothing, hours later.<br>
Nobody said it'd be straightforward, but that doesn't make this less boring.<br>
Sis, Your Majesty, I'm gonna patrol the area for a bit.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Renown META：</span><br>
Om, nom... Hawrigh. Fwake kherr. *gulp*...<br>
Newcastle, may I have seconds?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Newcastle：</span><br>
Certainly. Just a moment.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
You're sure you don't want a Royal Maid stationed here? It must be exhausting doing everything yourselves.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Renown META：</span><br>
While I'm grateful for the offer, I must politely decline. We're used to our isolation and would need time to readjust to the company of others.<br>
Of course, you may feel it necessary to leave a force here in the unlikely event of an enemy attack.<br>
However, I believe Repulse and I alone are sufficient to prevent anyone from invading your branch.<br>
All that is to say, we will manage on our own.<br>
If anyone could use more protection, I would say you do during these visits, Your Majesty.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vanguard：</span><br>
If I may interject, I also strongly discourage any more trips by yourself, Your Majesty!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Yes, yes, I know! Stop pestering me about it.<br>
How absurd it is that the Queen must tiptoe around territory that rightfully belongs to the Royal Navy!<br>
Curse that Bon Homme Richard... I WILL find a way to deal with her...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Communicator：</span><br>
BEEP BEEP!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vanguard：</span><br>
Your Majesty, did you hear that?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
I did! We must check the communicator at once!<br>
Good lord... We've done it!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Monarch：</span><br>
We've found a potential ally already?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
No. Settle down, Monarch.<br>
We've managed to connect to some terminals out there, but we still can't send any information yet.<br>
But, let's see... Good, the connection is stable and it doesn't seem we're being traced. We might just be able to receive data.<br>
While there's much room for improvement, this is excellent for a first attempt!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Newcastle：</span><br>
Your Majesty, we should prepare to leave.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
What? Oh, yes, it's gotten late.<br>
That will be it for today. Renown, please analyze the results of our test and conduct any necessary debugging of the equipment.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Renown META：</span><br>
Very well, Your Majesty.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
One more thing. An unidentified META infiltrated our museum warehouse and left behind what presumably is beacon data. I'll send it your way.<br>
We weren't able to match these data traces to anything in our database, but you might be acquainted with this individual.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Renown META：</span><br>
They appeared... in a museum?<br>
The beacon data will tell us if it's someone we know. Each META has a unique data signature.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Whoever it is, I hope you will be able to identify them. I look forward to hearing from you.<br>

<br>
6.A Hearty Dinner <br>
Royal Islands - Elizabeth's office<br>
With her work for the day complete, the queen leaned back in her comfortable chair.<br>
She leafed through a few reports on her desk, tossing finalized documents into a big pile.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Communicator：</span><br>
BEEP BEEP!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Ah, Bel. What do you have for me?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Belfast：</span><br>
Your Majesty, I have received a report regarding Vichya's movements.<br>
Their mass-produced fleet stationed at the Kerguelen Islands has evacuated, effectively leaving it and its Basilica facility deserted.<br>
Iris Libre appears unaware of this fact. Shall I contact Lady Richelieu?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
No need. She'll go running over in no time.<br>
...Wait a moment. Why would they even station that many mass-produced ships near the Antarctic region?<br>
Bel, tell the fleet in the region to capture the islands and investigate the Basilica at once.<br>
Find out what's inside, before the Tribunal gets to it!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Belfast：</span><br>
As you command. I shall see to it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
(The Basilicas are said to represent the authority of the Iris Orthodoxy... but that's not the whole story.)<br>
(The island that Richelieu occupied before contained a secret weapon called the Skybound Wall. There's a chance those facilities are the Holy See's research facilities.)<br>
(If we get to it before the Tribunal does, we might be able to get a step ahead of the Naval HQ and assist Richelieu in the process.)<br>
It's already getting late. Newcastle, we should head back now.<br>
Just bring dinner over to my bedchamber. I don't want anyone bothering me this evening.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Newcastle：</span><br>
Understood. Shall I cancel your visit to the Coronation Abbey?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
......Huh?<br>
There's STILL more work to do? Ugh, let me rest for half an hour first...<br>

The Queen's Ordinary Day<br>
<br>
7.News Before Bedtime <br>
A luxurious, old-fashioned carriage slowly rolled through the gates of Queen Elizabeth's castle as the sun fully submerged beneath the horizon.<br>
The carriage came to a stop, and an attending maid stepped forward to welcome the esteemed passenger.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gloucester：</span><br>
Good evening, Your Majest–<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Newcastle：</span><br>
Her Majesty is fast asleep. Please take her bags while I bring her to her bedchamber.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gloucester：</span><br>
Very well, but what shall I tell Lady Warspite?<br>
She's still waiting to hear from Her Majesty. Apparently, she has an urgent report to make.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Newcastle：</span><br>
That's a conundrum. I wouldn't want to wake Her Majesty...<br>
I'll speak to Lady Warspite and ask her to leave a message. I'll inform Her Majesty in the morn–<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Mmgh... Warspite...?<br>
What was that about Warspite?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Newcastle：</span><br>
Oh, Your Majesty! Well, she's on the line for you with important business.<br>
I considered answering on your behalf and forwarding her message to you tomorrow. Shall I do that?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
No need. I'm awake now anyway.<br>
I can't believe she's still up at this hour... I'll talk to her myself.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Newcastle：</span><br>
As you wish. Then what about the meeting with high command tomorrow?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
It will go ahead as planned.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Newcastle：</span><br>
Very well...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Gloucester, did anything of note happen while I was away?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gloucester：</span><br>
Yes. Sheffield had a report to give you, but I did not forward it to you at the time as your connection channel was not sufficiently secure.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
That was the right call.<br>
Newcastle, change of plans. Tell Warspite to hang up.<br>
I'll call her myself after I've read Sheffy's report. Save my supper for later.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Newcastle：</span><br>
Yes, Your Majesty. I shall bring the communicator to your office.<br>
<br>
It had already been a long day for the queen, but it was not quite over yet...<br>
