<br>
This is a day filled with love and joy...<br>
On this wonderful day, people make chocolate...<br>
And give it to their beloveds as a sign of their affection.<br>
At least, so they usually would, but an unprecedented disaster has struck the port this year!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Attilio Regolo：</span><br>
Oh no, oh no! C-Commander!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Torricelli：</span><br>
Bad news...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Surcouf：</span><br>
Our once-a-year celebration is gonna be for nothing!<br>
<br>
Three shipgirls fling open my office door and run in with anxious looks on their faces.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Whoa, what's wrong? Slow down and tell me what's going on.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Surcouf：</span><br>
The port's facing an honest-to-god life-or-death situation as we speak!<br>
There's a Valentine's chocolate crisis!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
A... chocolate crisis?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Surcouf：</span><br>
Yeah! The chocolate shop doesn't have any chocolate! Not a single piece!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Attilio Regolo：</span><br>
It's not just that... Even the molds used to make chocolate and all candies with chocolate inside have sold out.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Torricelli：</span><br>
All I wanted was to make you a mushroom-shaped chocolate...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
That IS pretty odd, I'll admit.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Surcouf：</span><br>
Which is why we're here! You're the only one we can turn to!<br>
How are we gonna make love chocolate if we can't even get the ingredients for it?!<br>
Commander, please save Valentine's Day!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
Z23 to Laffey! Please respond! Shelves A2, C1, and D2 need to be restocked ASAP!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
Zzz...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
Laffey! Wake up!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
Stock shelves... with chocolate... Zzz...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
Javelin to Z23! Laffey's down and out.<br>
Also, our stock is empty.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
How could this be...<br>
<br>
I walk into the port's chocolate shop.<br>
Despite the many posters inside advertising Valentine's Day chocolate, all the shelves are empty.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
There's been a flood of customers over the past few days, and there are too few of us to handle everything.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
While it may not be "good" news, our supplier has run out of chocolate, which takes the pressure off us...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
Starting today, the chocolate shop will... Zzz...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Alright, I get the situation.<br>
I'll do something about the supplier and your manpower shortage.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
Thanks a bunch! With you helping us, the shop will be back in business in no time!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
Yes, let's do this! Let's save Valentine's Day!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
Where will we get the chocolate from, though?<br>
<br>
After mulling it over for a while, I make a call to a somewhat unusual "supplier," if you could call her that.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB ：</span><br>
Request for chocolate supplies received. Initiating transport protocol.<br>
<br>
There's a great rumble in the distance that draws closer. Then, several huge containers equipped with parachutes come to a slow landing in the open area outside the shop.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
What's in these containers? Is all of it... chocolate?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
But I thought the port ran out of chocolate long ago...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB ：</span><br>
A sharp increase in the port's chocolate consumption was previously recorded.<br>
In response to this, I employed an emergency protocol to buy chocolate in bulk as a reserve stock.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
Hooray! Then Valentine's is saved!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
That must be why the supplier ran out...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
Finally feel like doing some work, Laffey?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
I wasn't slacking off... in the first place... Zzz...<br>
<br>
Thanks to TB's support, the chocolate supply issue has been solved for now.<br>
However, it remains to be seen whether this will be enough to satiate the surge of customers that will come tomorrow.<br>
We need to prepare as best as we can for that...<br>

<br>
It's now the day before Valentine's Day, and the chocolate shop has reopened for business.<br>
A line has formed outside the shop, despite it still being the early hours of the morning.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
The Commander told me about your manpower issue, and I'm here to help.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dewey：</span><br>
I'd like to chip in, too! I can help by making greeting cards!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
Thank gosh. Now we have enough workers to go around.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
As long as we all work together, we'll make it through this day!<br>
<br>
The shop's shutters rise, and at the same time, a flood of customers comes pouring in.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mogador：</span><br>
Um, excuse me... Do you know where your love potions are? The ones listed on the posters...<br>
I've been looking around, and I can't find them...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
Love... potions?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mogador：</span><br>
You know, the thing you give your sweetheart to excite and invigorate them...<br>
I won't put it in my chocolate – pinky promise! Heheh...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
Alright then. I'll go take a look.<br>
Nope, not here...<br>
Not here either...<br>
Oh! Here they are. Just–<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mogador：</span><br>
Wonderful! Thanks, Miss.<br>
I'll get out of your hair now...<br>
<br>
Just as Helena is about to say something, Mogador disappears like the wind.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
Wait! Mogador!<br>
<br>
In an out-of-sight place near where the "love potions" are kept, there is a line of small print that reads...<br>
"This product is an energy drink and only has the health benefit of energizing you. It does not have any other special properties."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Admiral Hipper：</span><br>
What an uninspired bunch of ribbons. Bland, boring, and lame!<br>
Since I'm giving chocolate to that stupid Commander, my wrapping needs to be creative.<br>
...Hm? What's this?<br>
"A rose and pearl ribbon – only the best for your most beloved"?<br>
It's got a modest rose window pattern, and the edges are trimmed with silk studded with miniature pearls...<br>
Hmm. Guess it's not bad.<br>
<br>
Right as Hipper reaches for the ribbon, a black-gloved hand goes for it as well.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Ah. What a touching coincidence, dear sister.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Admiral Hipper：</span><br>
Eugen?! Why the hell are you here?! Don't tell me you're thinking–<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
The same as you, yes.<br>
Though, in my opinion, this subdued color doesn't really suit a girl like you who's always loud and proud about her feelings.<br>
Want me to pick out a better one for you?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Admiral Hipper：</span><br>
Sh-shut up, you! I found it first, so it's MINE!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Is it? If it's first-come, first-served, then I got here just a bit quicker.<br>
<br>
The two get into a tug-of-war over the ribbon. Neither one wants to give it up.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
Dear customers, please calm down!<br>
Um, good news! We have another ribbon like that in our storage!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:425:希佩尔海军上将}&{namecode:427:欧根亲王}：</span><br>
Don't bother with it!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
Oh gosh...<br>
<br>
After a while of sparks flying between their clashing glares, they both suddenly let go of the ribbon at once.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Admiral Hipper：</span><br>
You know what?! On second thought, the pattern's nothing special! If you want it so badly, then take it!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Thanks for being so "thoughtful," dear sister.<br>
But, I've changed my mind. I'd get laughed at if people heard I picked the same wrapping as you<br>
<br>
The two exchange a glance, and then simply turn around and go opposite ways, as though nothing had happened, leaving Javelin standing there dumbstruck.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
Uh... What?!<br>
<br>
After the last customer leaves the shop, the shutters slowly descend.<br>
While there were some ups and downs, today's business was a great success thanks to everyone's hard work.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Let's hope things go just as smoothly tomorrow.<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
......<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
......<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
Zzz...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Come again? You've not had any customers today?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
Yes. Not a single one.<br>
<br>
It beggars belief. How can there not have been a single customer when today is Valentine's Day?<br>
I step out of the shop into the usually bustling shopping district, which is now unusually quiet.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
What, did everyone get the date wrong or something?<br>
<br>
As I stand there, confused, a crowd appears across the street from me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Attilio Regolo：</span><br>
Bunny, my trusted aide! Lead us to where the Commander is!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Surcouf：</span><br>
Oh, look! The Commander's right over there! Commandeeer! Hold on! People wanna give you their chocolates!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Torricelli：</span><br>
Hehehehe...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
Happy Valentine's Day, my dear Commander! I'd like to present to you this box of my chocolate!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mogador：</span><br>
Commandeeer, I've got chocolate made just for you! Don't worry, I promise I didn't put anything weird in it♥<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Admiral Hipper：</span><br>
Hmph! That idiot wants someone's chocolate more than anyone else's, and it's mine!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
My, how confident. Maybe you and I should see who's most worthy through a competition, hmm?<br>
<br>
The pressure of the approaching crowd gets to me, so I try to rush back into the shop... only to find my escape route is blocked.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
Commander, we made chocolates for you as well!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
Happy Valentine's, Commander...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
Thanks for helping us over the past few days! I hope you'll enjoy this Valentine's Day in peace!<br>
<br>
The cheers and shouts around me grow muffled, and I'm soon buried under a warm wave of chocolate...<br>
In the end, I was given a small hill's worth of chocolate. As you might expect, eating it all proved quite the challenge.<br>
You could certainly call it... a luxuriously sweet problem.<br>
I want to repay them for all their kindness...<br>
And to that end, I'll have to make some unforgettable Valentine's memories with them.<br>
Valentine's Day - The Chocolatastrophy! – The End<br>
