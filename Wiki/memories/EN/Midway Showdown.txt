<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
Hornet i'm receiving a decrypted telegram. "AF is short on water, should the attack plan consider this?" Looks like something big just took our bait.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet：</span><br>
Even the most cunning fox cannot hide its tail, hehe.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yorktown：</span><br>
Now that we've confirmed "AF" is indeed Midway, we should move out immediately.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
But Yorktown, your injuries...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yorktown：</span><br>
Don't worry. The maintenance crew were working around the clock for three days to bring me back up to shape. They're so reliable.<br>
Enterprise, how about you? If you get hurt again because of me, Vestal will never let me hear the end of it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
F-fine...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yorktown：</span><br>
Considering it's not every day that all three of us get to fight together, we've got to show off the power of the Yorktown-class!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise & Hornet：</span><br>
Yes ma'am! For freedom, and the glory of the Eagle Union!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yorktown：</span><br>
Union Task Force 16, 17, sortieing!<br>

<span style="color:#ff0000;">{{AF|Akagi}}：</span><br>
Oh my, how many times does this make now? Haven't these dullards learnt by now that their flying pieces of scrap metal are no match for our Zeros?<br>
It looks like AF's enemies are capable of nothing more than scrabbling desperately at our feet. Hurry and prepare to launch our next wave of attacks on the island.<br>
<span style="color:#ff0000;">{{AF|Kaga}}：</span><br>
Akagi, I think we still have to keep track of the movement of enemy aircraft. It would be prudent to leave enough fighters on reserve...<br>
<span style="color:#ff0000;">{{AF|Akagi}}：</span><br>
What is there to fear? Tone's recon planes haven't found any of these "carriers." Perhaps they turned tail and ran at the sight of our mighty fleet?<br>
After all, "they" are behind us, observing our glorious battle... ahaha!<br>

<span style="color:#ff0000;">Hiryuu：</span><br>
Are we ready yet?! The enemy's counterattack is incoming!<br>
<span style="color:#ff0000;">Akagi：</span><br>
...1st and 2nd Carrier Divisions, load your planes with torpedoes. Prepare for anti-ship combat!<br>
<span style="color:#ff0000;">Kaga：</span><br>
What?! Change equipment right now?!<br>
Akagi, I can't do that! What if the enemy attacks while we're unprepared?!<br>
<span style="color:#ff0000;">Akagi：</span><br>
We need to be ready for when the enemy fleet appears!<br>
<span style="color:#ff0000;">Souryuu：</span><br>
Multiple enemy aircraft approaching at an altitude of 2000m, bearing 235°!<br>
<span style="color:#ff0000;">Akagi：</span><br>
They're coming from behind?!<br>
<span style="color:#ff0000;">Kaga：</span><br>
Dammit! Call back the fighters! We need anti-air now!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
Too late! McClusky squadron, attaaack!!<br>

<span style="color:#ff0000;">{{AF|Kaga}}：</span><br>
Graaaaghhh!<br>
<span style="color:#ff0000;">Akagi：</span><br>
Kaga! Kagaaaaaaaaaa!<br>
<span style="color:#ff0000;">{{AF|Kaga}}：</span><br>
To let my guard down... at such a critical time...<br>
 ...Akagi... Sister...<br>
<br>
Some things in this world can only be described as divine providence...<br>
What seemed to be a haphazard, throwaway attack would forever split open the annals of history.<br>
Nobody could have known that this moment was the single crux upon which the world would shift.<br>
This moment, when strength, luck, and even the whimsical hand of fate all seemed to blur together and coalesce...<br>
... would become known as...<br>
"The Five Minutes of Fate."<br>

Hard starboard! Evade the enemy attacks, and call back all the Zeros this instant!<br>

<span style="color:#ff0000;">{{AF|Akagi}}：</span><br>
In the end, the vast ocean is but a playground...<br>
So this time, I'll admit defeat...<br>
To think that we could be outwitted by such an ragtag, antiquated bunch... as expected of the Commander that I chose...<br>
Ahhh... what a pity that I swore fealty to "Them..." Otherwise... Commander, I'd like to thorougly bully you a bit~<br>
Perhaps one day... I can escape... this fate...<br>

…<br>
So, the First Carrier Division and my sister have already...<br>
But I can't let it end like this... All squadrons, attack!!<br>
I'll show you what the Second Carrier Division is made of! This is our final counterattack!<br>

<span style="color:#ff0000;">{{AF|Hiryuu}}：</span><br>
I'll put every last ounce of my remaining strength... into this single attack!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yorktown：</span><br>
Aaaagh!!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise & Hornet：</span><br>
Yorktown!!<br>
<span style="color:#ff0000;">{{AF|Hiryuu}}：</span><br>
At least... I was able to slightly salvage the situation... for "Their" sake...<br>
I can die without any regrets...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yorktown：</span><br>
Why are you two crying at a time like this? We just won a decisive battle.<br>
Soon, the whole world will remember your names. You will become legendary warships, and people will sing your praises for generations.<br>
And soon, the war will end as well. Humanity will understand each other better then, and reclaim these seas together...<br>
And for us, who were born to realize their ideals, this is a fitting end.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
No... I won't accept this!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yorktown：</span><br>
Looks like... it's about time for us to part ways...<br>
Watching the two of you grow from immature children into the aces of the Navy... has been my pride and joy...<br>
Finally... I entrust my dear friend to you...<br>
Take him with you... and spread the spirit of freedom throughout this world...<br>
I'm sure you two will be able to do it... my beloved sisters...<br>
<span style="color:#ff0000;">？？？：</span><br>
Once again, so many souls are dispersing...<br>
You saw it too? This dazzling brilliance...<br>
This form of "evolution..." How beautiful! How sad!<br>
It is time then, to move our "plan" forward as well...<br>
<br>
