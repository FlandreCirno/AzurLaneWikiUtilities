Where the Sun Doesn't Shine<br>
<br>
The Unmotivated Girl<br>
Today is a day off. Rays of light shine through the window, dyeing the floor with a pleasant golden glow.<br>
It's a bright, cheerful day. For everyone but me, that is.<br>
I stare at the pile of paperwork on my desk and let out a sigh. There's so much work to get through still.<br>
As for the reason I have all this work to catch up on... she's sitting over there in the corner.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Torricelli：</span><br>
......<br>
<br>
Torricelli, my secretary. Squeezed into a corner of my office, she looks lost in thought.<br>
Sometimes, she produces some sort of lab report and writes something down. She rarely ever talks unless spoken to first.<br>
She reminds me of a mushroom, growing quietly out of sight.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Torricelli：</span><br>
I think I'll base this report on the office's internal layout... Hehehe...<br>
...Hm? What is it, Commander?<br>
<br>
She senses my gaze and slowly turns to look at me.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："Remember that work I assigned you?"</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Torricelli：</span><br>
Work? You mean... sorting those papers?<br>
I did that long ago. It felt like plain busy work... Hehehe... You underestimate me, don't you?<br>
Here. Everything's in order...<br>
<br>
I skim the folder she gave me. Not only is it neatly organized, but it also includes easily readable annotations. However...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Torricelli：</span><br>
Why didn't I give it to you earlier? Well, you never asked...<br>
I'm not sleeping on the job... Communication isn't my forte... that's all...<br>
Now if you don't mind, I'd like to be left to my devices...<br>
When you think about it... Staying out of your hair counts as helping you do your paperwork, right?<br>
It may not look like it, but I am assisting you, as a secretary should...<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："Doing nothing does not count as helping."</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2："I've got more papers for you to process."</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Torricelli：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Dang it... You saw right through me...<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Ugh. Talking to people is such a chore...<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Look, I'll be here if you need help... Don't talk to me unless it's important, thanks...<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''She takes back the organized folder, then shuffles back into her dark corner...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Torricelli：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''W-wait... THIS much?<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Fine... I don't wanna, but if you insist...<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Suddenly I don't feel like surveying your office anymore... Oh well, I'll go back to my corner and get to work.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Don't call for me unless it's something important...<br>
<br>

<br>
Where the Sun Doesn't Shine<br>
<br>
Out of Sight, Out of Mind<br>
It's a new morning. The sun is already high in the sky, lighting up the road.<br>
I woke up later than usual, since I worked overtime late into the night yesterday.<br>
By the time I sit down in my chair, exhausted, it's already past the time I'm supposed to start working.<br>
After a quick survey of my office, I can safely say there's nobody around.<br>
"Phew... I've got to keep at it. There's still no shortage of work to be done."<br>
I stack my finished documents into a small pile, unable to enjoy the achievement for even a moment due to my aching shoulders.<br>
The clock says it's time for a break. All this time later, Torricelli is still nowhere to be seen. Where is she?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">???：</span><br>
Commander... Are you almost done?<br>
<br>
A sudden voice makes me jump. I turn around and find Torricelli, sitting quietly in the corner.<br>
"Were you here the whole time, hiding just out of sight?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Torricelli：</span><br>
Yeah, I've been here all morning... Hehehe... I like sitting in shady corners. They're nice and quiet...<br>
I didn't say anything because you were focused on your work, and I didn't wanna disturb you... Hehehe...<br>
<br>
"You're lying. It's written all over your face. You just wanted an excuse to sit around."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Torricelli：</span><br>
...<br>
......<br>
<br>
"I will interpret your silence as conclusive evidence."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Torricelli：</span><br>
...L-let's change topics! Need to take a break, Commander? We could chill out together...<br>
<br>
"Together? I was under the impression you preferred being alone."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Torricelli：</span><br>
Usually, yeah... I feel like I'm being watched when I'm around people...<br>
But not around you, for some reason... I feel at ease when I'm with you...<br>
Plus, you're a hard worker and look after people, so yeah... Hehehe... Being around you is pretty nice...<br>
S-so, to show you my gratitude... I will try to relieve your fatigue...<br>
Starting with a massage... I learned it from a book. It should work...<br>
<br>
She starts massaging me. I try to enjoy it as much as I can... And by "enjoy" I mean "wrap my head around this novel experience."<br>
While I know she's trying her best, she doesn't quite know how much force to apply.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Torricelli：</span><br>
Umm... Does it not feel good...? In theory, this should be the perfect amount of pressure to use...<br>
Maybe... Maybe the theory is wrong...?<br>
<br>
"Not necessarily. You need some degree of experience to give a great massage, and that's something you can't just get from a book."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Torricelli：</span><br>
Ohh, I see... I'll incorporate your feedback into my own theory, then...<br>
Also... There's no deep meaning behind this massage... I'm rewarding you for your hard work, that's all...<br>
I still prefer being alone... That fact hasn't changed, just so you know... Hehehe...<br>

Where the Sun Doesn't Shine<br>
<br>
Vacation after Sunset<br>
Huh? Go outside? You mean... now?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Torricelli：</span><br>
I... I can't... It's too bright. I'll melt under the sun...<br>
<br>
It's time for a break, so I raise the idea of going on a stroll with Torricelli. To my surprise, she doesn't want to.<br>
"But why? The sun is shining, the breeze feels great. You couldn't ask for better weather."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Torricelli：</span><br>
Th-the sun is the problem...<br>
I just... I prefer cool, dark places where people won't look...<br>
<br>
It sounds like she won't budge on this. I decide to ask her again in the evening.<br>
Noon has passed, and I've now finished all my work for the day.<br>
The sun has begun to set, and before long, it'll be Torricelli's favorite time of the day – dusk.<br>
So, I take her outside on a stroll. Despite the fact there aren't many people walking around, she trails right behind me, as though avoiding others entirely.<br>
"What's the matter? Do you dislike crowded places?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Torricelli：</span><br>
Not really... I just don't want to run into someone I know, because then I'd have to say hi and that stuff...<br>
If I could choose, I'd rather be alone in my room...<br>
Um, that's not to say I don't like going out with you. That's different. But...<br>
...No, I think you're right. Crowded places make me anxious...<br>
<br>
"I understand. In that case, let's go to a place where there aren't many people."<br>
My initial plan was to take her to the amusement park, but that's a lively place, so it's likely not something she'd enjoy.<br>
"How about..."<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："The aquarium?"</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2："The observatory?"</span>'''''<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''An aquarium is a great place to tour with someone. Besides, I'd be surprised if it's crowded at this hour.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Torricelli：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Hmm... It's probably barren right now, so that sounds like it'll be fun...<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Best of all, fish won't try to strike up a conversation with me...<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''She might be into stargazing. It's nearly nighttime, too.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Torricelli：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''The observatory... The idea of looking at the stars with you sounds strangely romantic... Hehehe...<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Hardly anyone visits the observatory on weekdays, so nobody will get between us... Hehehe...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Torricelli：</span><br>
Although... Like I said, I'd rather be in the comfort of my own room...<br>
<br>
...Be that as it may, she needs some fresh air. Let's see where the night takes us.<br>

<br>
Where the Sun Doesn't Shine<br>
<br>
Mushroom Banquet?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Torricelli：</span><br>
*wheeze*... I'm so tired...<br>
I'm already well past my recommended exercise limit... I'm gonna fall apart...<br>
<br>
After I took her to the aquarium first, we then stargazed at the observatory.<br>
"It really wasn't a long walk, yet you're THIS exhausted? Do you not get much exercise?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Torricelli：</span><br>
......<br>
I do research... I rarely need to go outside...<br>
<br>
I thought as much.<br>
"Should I ask the Sardegnian dorm managers to make an exercise program for you?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Torricelli：</span><br>
...No thank you...<br>
<br>
Night rolls around. After all that walking, I decide to treat her to a restaurant dinner.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Torricelli：</span><br>
Whew... Finally, some rest... I can barely think from how hungry and tired I am...<br>
I feel alive again...<br>
Hey... Do you mind if I order for us both?<br>
<br>
I have a bad feeling about this... Still, I tell her to go ahead.<br>
Hopefully, I won't have to eat any questionable food. Then again, this is a restaurant – their menu should be perfectly fine.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Torricelli：</span><br>
Let's have this... this... and this.<br>
<br>
She selects a few curious menu items; salted mushroom skewers, creamy mushroom chowder, and mushroom cake...<br>
It can't be a coincidence that she picked three mushroom dishes.<br>
"You really like mushrooms, huh?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Torricelli：</span><br>
Yeah... Hehehe... They like the dark and hate the sun, just like me. Plus, they're tasty...<br>
They're also perfect subjects for study, since they grow in clusters and never make a sound... There's a lot to learn about them.<br>
<br>
"Let's add one more thing to our order."<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："A meat dish."</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2："Another mushroom dish."</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Torricelli：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Meat is good too, but I really want you to try these mushroom dishes...<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Once you've had a bite, you'll never forget the taste... Hehehe...<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''"That's a very ominous way to phrase it..."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Torricelli：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Oh, you like mushrooms too? Great minds think alike... Hehehe...<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''"I'm not especially fond of them, I just want to keep the mushroom theme going, I suppose."<br>
<br>
...The dishes she recommended were good. Once our slightly unusual dinner is over, we retreat home for the night.<br>

Where the Sun Doesn't Shine<br>
<br>
Showing She Cares ?<br>
Somewhere in the Sardegnian dorm, there's a small, ordinary-looking room. But, looks can be deceiving.<br>
In reality, it's a secret laboratory. Inside, there is a girl tinkering with tools, working on some sort of invention.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
Nice... Looking good so far!<br>
<br>
That's when someone knocks on the door.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
What's the passphrase?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">???：</span><br>
Observation and testing is the root of all deductions.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
Ah, Torricelli! Come on in.<br>
<br>
The door opens for Torricelli, who bears a somewhat distressed expression.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
What brings you here this late? Sudden hit of inspiration? A new idea to share?<br>
Maybe to borrow some machinery to develop new weapons? Speaking of which, I still haven't gotten the last batch we agreed on.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Torricelli：</span><br>
Not quite...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
Ahh, wait – one of my inventions broke? But that's theoretically impossible... Whatever the problem is, it has to stem from your prototype!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Torricelli：</span><br>
No, da Vinci, it's nothing like that...<br>
Listen for a sec... Supposing you wanted to give the Commander a gift... what would it be?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
.........<br>
...Come again?<br>
Nooow I get it. You want to return the Commander's kindness in some way. Hmm...<br>
(You're asking the wrong person! My forte is inventing things, not interpersonal relationships! Heck, I WISH I had the answer!)<br>
You know, I'm really surprised you're asking about gifts.<br>
In your case, shouldn't it be enough to say, "I'm glad I have you to look after me"?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Torricelli：</span><br>
...Ugh.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
Ahem. Back on topic... I'm not sure what to tell you, other than, "Get something the Commander would love."<br>
It doesn't have to be expensive or exotic. What people like most is receiving something they really needed.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Torricelli：</span><br>
Something... they really needed...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
Yup! Sadly, I have no idea what the Commander needs...<br>
Yup! Sadly, I have no idea what the Commander needs...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Torricelli：</span><br>
You're right...<br>
That's it... Now I know what to get. Hehehe... Thanks, da Vinci.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
You're welcome!<br>
(Phew! I didn't lose face, even if all I did was tell her the obvious...)<br>
(Still, it's good that I did! If I hadn't, who knows what dangerous stuff she might've given the Commander!)<br>
(Hope it goes well, Commander.)<br>

Where the Sun Doesn't Shine<br>
<br>
A Pleasant Surprise<br>
A few days later...<br>
As Torricelli has begun adapting to her responsibilities as my secretary, my workload has gotten lighter.<br>
She is so proficient at sifting through data and sorting documents, she could it in her sleep.<br>
"I know we're not always on the same wavelength, but the work you do is more than satisfactory."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Torricelli：</span><br>
Hehehe... I like the acknowledgement... More, please...<br>
<br>
She tilts her head slightly downward, presenting it to me. She must want me to do something.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：(Pat her on the head.)</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：(Ruffle her hair.)</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Torricelli：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Mmh... Keep doing that... Hehehe...<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Her cheeks seem to turn red, which I don't think I've ever seen from her before.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Torricelli：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''M-my hair is messy as is... Don't make it worse...<br>
<br>
"If you'd always worked this well, I could've enjoyed some time off not long ago."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Torricelli：</span><br>
Th-that's in the past now... Let bygones be bygones...<br>
Ahem... Let's change topics. Have a look at this, Commander!<br>
<br>
She produces a big box encased in wrapping paper.<br>
A gift, from Torricelli? I wasn't expecting that.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：(Open it.)</span>'''''<br>
<br>
There's a carefully-crafted machine inside. It looks like it's made to sort paperwork.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Torricelli：</span><br>
It's a present... I-I figured you wanted something to help with your work...<br>
I asked Da Vinci to design it. It automatically organizes documents according to their tags...<br>
It's sure to make that part of your job quicker... and give you more time to spend with me... Hehehe...<br>
<br>
"That's actually quite useful. Maybe a bit TOO useful. Won't this machine effectively do your job for you?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Torricelli：</span><br>
Exactly, which means I don't need to work... I can just relax all day and sit in my cozy corner...<br>
<br>
"It also means my workload will never get any lighter than it is now..."<br>
"Still, it's a kind gesture. Thank you for the gift."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Torricelli：</span><br>
Hehehe...<br>

Where the Sun Doesn't Shine<br>
<br>
True Warmth Comes from Within<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Torricelli：</span><br>
Commander, is your work nearly done? Hehehe... Then come relax with me...<br>
I've also come up with a plan to retrofit your desk... It'll give it all sorts of added functionality...<br>
<br>
I've been working with Torricelli for quite a while now. Not only have we grown closer, but our spare time together has become more enjoyable as well.<br>
My first impression of her as a taciturn, gloomy girl was wrong. She's very friendly once you get to know her.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Torricelli：</span><br>
How about we go out earlier than usual today? I've had plenty of rest, so I think I can go for a longer walk... Probably...<br>
<br>
"You sure? There's a long while to go until sunset."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Torricelli：</span><br>
I know... I meant AFTER sundown, but we can discuss where we'll go before then, right...?<br>
There's no way I'm going out in broad daylight... I'd melt in minutes...<br>
<br>
"I think you have more in common with a snowman than a mushroom."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Torricelli：</span><br>
It's not just about sunlight... I don't like places where people can see me, either...<br>
That's why I like dark, damp, isolated places... Just like mushrooms do...<br>
Oh, and I can think more clearly when I'm by myself...<br>
I guess one way to put it is... "Geniuses are born lonely," or something...<br>
<br>
"On the other hand, you sort of cling to me like a wet towel."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Torricelli：</span><br>
Hehehe... You're different... You make me feel at ease...<br>
You don't make me feel nervous, like others do...<br>
The more I see of your caring, hardworking side... the more I want to stay with you forever...<br>
I think... I've caught the Commander dependency virus...<br>
<br>
"Sounds like it. I don't mind, though. I'm happy to be relied upon."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Torricelli：</span><br>
A-anyway... I want to thank you... for always being so nice to me...<br>
And if you'll let me... I'll gladly keep relying on you to look after me...<br>
Hehehe... That restaurant we ate at was incredible... Can we go again today? I want to try more mushroom dishes...<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："You're on. Let's see who can eat the most."</span>'''''<br>
