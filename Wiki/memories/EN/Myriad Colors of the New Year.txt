Golden Dragon Among Auspicious Clouds<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ägir：</span><br>
Happy Lunar New Year, Commander.<br>
Welcome to the abode of the golden dragon among auspicious clouds.<br>
I've heard bits and pieces of the Empery's dragon folklore. Apparently their dragons are very different to Iron Blood's.<br>
Incidentally, their dragons inspired the design of this outfit, too.<br>
What do you think? Looks quite stunning, doesn't it?<br>
...What's with that look, huh? Are you suggesting that it doesn't fit the spirit of the holiday?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："Of course not. It does."</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2："I'd say it's a bit risqué."</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ägir：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Heehee. That's what I thought. You have good taste.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''But what matters most is that I'M happy with how it looks.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ägir：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''I don't care for your critique! I chose this outfit very deliberately, I'll have you know.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''So what if this isn't a holiday for celebrating virility? I know that, obviously!<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Hmph. Whatever. You simply have no taste in fashion.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ägir：</span><br>
...I will say, I'm pleasantly surprised by how quiet it is here. Everywhere else seems to be swept up in merrymaking.<br>
Seeing as you've mostly finished the festival preparations, why don't you have a seat next to me?<br>
Even lords of the sea yearn for moments of respite.<br>
I take her up on her suggestion and sit down next to her.<br>
Heehee. You're curious about the aroma, are you?<br>
It's from an incense I made. I learned how to just today.<br>
That's not the only exciting skill I've picked up. In fact, it's one of many.<br>
"Such as...?"<br>
Oh, you know! Calligraphy! Writing with this fluffy brush is more satisfying than I expected.<br>
My only issue is... I'm unsure how to hold the brush. Is it like this? Or like... this?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："I'll show you."</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：Simply observe her.</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ägir：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Hah! Of course YOU would know the proper technique.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Then I shall give you a demonstration of what I've learned, and I permit you to verbally correct me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ägir：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Bah, I can't seem to get it right...<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''I refuse to believe you don't know the proper technique! Stop gawking and tell me!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ägir：</span><br>
Ägir haplessly runs the brush over the paper. I can feel something bad about to happen...<br>
Aahh! Dammit, I got ink on myself!<br>
...Do I need help? No, I can do it on my own, thank you very much!<br>
A bit of floundering later...<br>
Ugh... This is needlessly complicated...<br>
Don't you grin at me! I've figured it out now!<br>
...There! Finally.<br>
Forget about the new skills thing! We'll simply lie back, relax, and enjoy the quiet!<br>

<br>
Frolicking Flowers, Verse I<br>
Walking into a room, I smell fresh ink in the air. I presume someone is writing Spring Festival couplets... which isn't entirely right.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ying Swei：</span><br>
Heheh!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chao Ho：</span><br>
Hey! I heard you laugh!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ying Swei：</span><br>
Laugh? You're just imagining it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chao Ho：</span><br>
I know what I heard! You clearly snickered up there!<br>
That confirms it – you're playing a prank on me. Ugghh...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ying Swei：</span><br>
Ahem... Happy Lunar New Year, Commander.<br>
Sister, you should finish up down there before the Commander sees you in a rather shameful pose.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chao Ho：</span><br>
The Commander's here?! Since when?! Err... Happy Lunar New Year!<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："What are you up to, Ying Swei?"</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ying Swei：</span><br>
Heehee. Nothing you should worry about.<br>
More specifically, I'm writing couplets, as I'm sure you can tell.<br>
Feel free to take a seat and watch while I finish up.<br>
What about Chao Ho? Ah, she's in charge of putting up the ornaments.<br>
Though it does seem she's having... a bit of trouble, let's say♪<br>
"What are you doing with that joystick?"<br>
Heehee. Oh, just having a little bit of innocent fun, I suppose.<br>
Shhh. As the proverb goes, "he who knows, does not speak."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chao Ho：</span><br>
Come ooon! Stop running away, you little pipsqueak! Get back here with my ornament!<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："Just don't take the prank too far."</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ying Swei：</span><br>
Of course not. I only want to leave you with a lovely memory from us both.<br>
On that note, I hope you'll enjoy the rest of the Lunar New Year, Commander♪<br>

Frolicking Flowers, Verse II<br>
Walk into a room, I smell fresh ink in the air. I presume someone is writing Spring Festival couplets... which isn't entirely right.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chao Ho：</span><br>
Hey! I heard you laugh!<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chao Ho：</span><br>
The Commander's here?! Since when?! Err... Happy Lunar New Year!<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："What's up, Chao Ho?"</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chao Ho：</span><br>
A small problem causing me a big headache, that's what! Good thing you showed up just now.<br>
So, Ying Swei said she'd write the couplets if I hung up the ornaments. Easy job, right?<br>
And it was, until this little bugger came along and stole the ornaments! I guarantee you Ying Swei is behind it, too!<br>
Anyway, could you help? I need to catch that little thief right away!<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："Sure thing."</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chao Ho：</span><br>
...Whuah?! I wasn't asking you to come under the table with me!<br>
H-hey! Watch your hands, pervert!<br>
What are you touching me for?! Eep!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ying Swei：</span><br>
What are you doing with the Commander under the table, hmm~?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chao Ho：</span><br>
N-n-n-nothing! Nothing at all! Ugh...<br>
...Finally! We've caught the bastard. Now to get to the bottom of this...<br>
Yiiiiiing! Sweeeeei!<br>
She's... gone?! She totally hightailed it out of here!<br>
After her, Commander! When I get my hands on her, she's gonna be SO sorry!<br>

<br>
The Gate Dragon's Advent<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Rupprecht：</span><br>
Ugh... Where has that idiot gone? Just as the festival enters its busiest hour, too...<br>
Oh, there you are! Over here, Commander!<br>
Heh! Here, take this!<br>
...What is it? A red envelope, duh. I think that's what they call it.<br>
While there's no money inside, it's still a gift from me, so you owe me your loyalty all the way into the next year!<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："Is that really how the tradition works?"</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Rupprecht：</span><br>
Obviously! That's why they give them to their subordinates.<br>
And you're below me, so I expect you to humbly accept it.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Stare in silence.</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2："Well, here's a gift from me – a small treat."</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Rupprecht：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Hmph. I'll take your silence to mean, "Of course, Milady."<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Perfect! Now give me a full tour of the port's Spring Festival makeover! It's your duty, you know♪<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Rupprecht：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Hm? What's that?<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Nom... It's a "tanghulu"? It's sour yet sweet, and surprisingly tasty.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Not bad. In return, you get the exclusive privilege of holding my hand while giving me a tour of all the festivities!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Rupprecht：</span><br>
"Why do you need a guide? You weren't lost up until a moment ago, were you?"<br>
Huh? Nuh-uh! I was the polar OPPOSITE of lost!<br>
O-obviously! Now quit wasting time and lead the way!<br>
Huh. The Empery sure knows how to throw a bustling festival.<br>
But why do they call it the Spring Festival? It's still the middle of winter.<br>
Meh, not like it matters much. Let's go see that dancing flying lion Ägir told me about.<br>
"What dancing flying lion?"<br>
What, you seriously don't know?<br>
I'm talking about that beast that flies from place to place and scares the daylights out of little kids.<br>
...It has a name? Okay, well...<br>
So what if it's called a nian or whatever? If I SAY it's a lion then it's a LION!<br>
I will hear no more arguing from that big mouth of yours! Let's go see it!<br>
This time, I'll lead the way! And you'll follow for the rest of the year, like the loyal servant you are♪<br>
