Northern Parliament Base - Location Unknown<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
...Our intentions are as stated in our message to the Eagle Union command.<br>
The Northern Parliament will commence a retaliatory operation against the Iron Blood for their senseless attacks on our relief supplies.<br>
We have requested the Commander's assistance in this campaign.<br>
This operation has the approval of the highest echelons of our leadership, and holds the highest degree of priority for the Northern Parliament.<br>
There is no rescinding or halting it now. We will continue on this path, no matter what the Eagle Union's reply may be.<br>
Let it be known, we are mobilizing with one goal in mind: putting a stop to this war.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
What?! You can't be serious! You can't go forward with something this big all willy-nilly!<br>
We've worked hard enough just to get the situation to where it is right now! This isn't something you can just decide without consulting the rest of us first!<br>
(Did they find out about the Iron Blood's experiments? Is that what brought this on? Either way, this is NOT a good time to be settling scores...)<br>
Please, let's put this on the backburner for now. There are still Sirens active in the Arctic areas, right? That should be our next priority for now.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yat Sen：</span><br>
Saratoga, I have to disagree. The Crimson Axis has attacked Northern Parliament supply vessels under the pretense of a "Reenactment."<br>
While none of us wish to be mired in pointless infighting, if push comes to shove, we must stand our ground.<br>
Soyuz's plan follows this principle. It is also worth pointing out that the Commander has not shown any opposition to this plan either.<br>
And I suspect, we will soon find out about what they truly have in mind. Let us wait and see how things unfold, Saratoga.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">King George V：</span><br>
I concur. It seems inconceivable that Soyuz would just accidentally "leak" her plans to the Naval HQ.<br>
Know that we would like to see the Iron Blood be put in their place. Yet for the sake of maintaining even this delicate status quo, the situation should be left to the Commander.<br>
Still, the Crimson Axis's movements bring us no peace of mind. Mass-produced ships have been seen entering and exiting Toulon, and the Vichya Dominion also seems poised to move.<br>
Though Sardegna and the Sakura Empire have been silent, who knows how long that will last? What else will be done under the guise of a "Reenactment?"<br>
Therefore, the question that the Royal Navy has for you is: How far are you willing to go?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
The fact that we're requesting the Commander's aid should assure you that we seek a measured response.<br>
Moreover, I have a general understanding of the Commander's response as well as the scope of the Iron Blood's movements.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">King George V：</span><br>
I see. The last thing we would want is for humanity to devolve into bickering while the Siren threat still looms large.<br>
However, I am not impressed by your unilateral announcement.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
All I can say is, we all have our own circumstances.<br>
I hope we can still count on the Royal Navy's assistance in supplying the Northern Parliament's war efforts, lest we lose our initiative.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">King George V：</span><br>
Very well. We will maintain the flow of supplies as before so that the Northern Parliament can continue to push back against the Sirens.<br>
Surely, that is what the Commander would want as well.<br>
However, should a large-scale conflict break out, know in advance that the Royal Navy will not directly participate.<br>
At least not in the opening act of the engagement. I'm sure that Iris Libre shares my view on this?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Richelieu：</span><br>
Indeed. Iris Libre cannot afford to be dragged into a conflict of this nature.<br>
I echo the Royal Navy's sentiment in asking that the Northern Parliament's operation not interfere with the other factions.<br>
Especially in matters concerning the Vi– Ahem... In any case, we shall handle our own internal affairs.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
Rest assured. This is the reason why I requested the Commander's assistance.<br>
We are aware of the situation with the Vichya, Cardinal. You have my word that we will not interfere.<br>
And finally, we promise to not use any of the Royal Navy's aid for this operation, focusing it solely towards our efforts against the Sirens.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
(Bleh, she sounds way too sure about all of this. Talk about too good to be true...)<br>
So I have a question! What kind of fighting force does the Northern Parliament plan to send out on this operation?<br>
As far as I know, the bulk of your forces has been concentrated in the North fighting off the Sirens, which is why you've rarely participated in the Reenactments.<br>
Besides, I dunno if anyone else feels like this is the elephant in the room, but how does the Northern Parliament plan to go against the Iron Blood's technology? To my understanding, most of your fleet is rather... old-fashioned.<br>
(Surely Soyuz also knows about the Iron Blood's blueprint ships... If they were to deploy those ships against them, what chance would the Northern Parliament stand...?)<br>
(Wait... that excessive confidence... Does the Northern Parliament also have blueprint ships of their own?)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
Thanks to the Commander's aid, we were able to capture the Sirens' iceberg stronghold, allowing us to free up a large amount of our forces.<br>
There is a lot less pressure on our defensive lines compared to before. We will hold as long as we begin the operation promptly and finish up as quickly as possible.<br>
While blueprint ships are certainly a force to be reckoned with, they are limited by their cost and difficulty of development. We will be able to gauge the impact they'll be able to have on the battlefield.<br>
With the intelligence we have, I can assure you that this battle will not turn into a Reenactment.<br>
I cannot disclose anything else about the nature of our intelligence, but I hope this is enough to address Saratoga's concerns.<br>
The Eagle Union should have firsthand knowledge of our Polar Fleet's capabilities. We will be able to go blow-for-blow with the Iron Blood.<br>
Finally, the Commander's participation should mitigate any unpredictable scenarios.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
What if the Commander declines, or is asked to help the Iron Blood?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
Should the Commander be absent... we already have contingencies in place.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
I'm not quite sure what to think still... I find it hard to believe that the Naval HQ would just nod and go along with a plan this ambitious.<br>
(Yat Sen might know more than she's letting on, but green-lighting an operation like this doesn't seem right, even if the Commander knows about it...)<br>
I hope you're not getting the Commander into any weirdness...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
You are right to have some reservations. We won't deny the possibility that the Commander might be exposed to danger during this operation.<br>
But, the same goes for any time the Commander joins an operation with the Eagle Union.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
(Ugh... I don't have a comeback for that...)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
Having that said, we will respect the Commander's decision, whatever it might be.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
Well, I guess it wouldn't make sense for us to make decisions for the Commander in advance...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
I'm glad we could reach an understanding, Saratoga. Will there be any further questions?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
Oh, right! The Eagle Union isn't prohibited from joining this operation, right? Would it be acceptable if we sent a support fleet?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
We don't have any objections to that, but might I ask why?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
Hmm... Just as an insurance option, in case the Commander's life is threatened in any way.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">King George V：</span><br>
Apologies for the interruption, but I believe the Northern Parliament would be able to accomplish their goals more easily with the assistance of another fleet.<br>
Saratoga's considerations about the Commander's safety are shared by every person here, and the presence of an Eagle Union fleet would go a long way in ensuring that no Reenactment occurs.<br>
Preventing a Reenactment would kill two birds with one stone, eliminating the biggest source of risk to the Commander's safety.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
Does that mean that the Royal Navy supports having the Commander participate in this operation?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">King George V：</span><br>
I wouldn't say "support," since nothing we say here matters if the Commander declines or Soyuz declines your proposal.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
That's true... Now that I think about it, why isn't Queen Elizabeth here?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">King George V：</span><br>
Her Majesty has her own way of doing things. Do you have some objection to me being here in her stead?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
Ah... Not at all! I wasn't trying to imply anything like that!<br>
(Woah... Did I make things awkward all of a sudden?)<br>
Well, in any case, let's bring your proposal to the Commander and then assess the situation from there.<br>
We've all heard what Soyuz has to say except for the Commander, and it should be possible to get the others in the Eagle Union on board.<br>
By the way, if everything pans out, can we have permission to use the Northern Parliament's ports and have safe passage through your waters?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
Of course. Anything for the success of the operation.<br>
But, everything hinges on the Commander's response. Let us continue our discussions then.<br>
Hopefully I kept a good-enough poker face...<br>
With the Mikoyan's discovery, we must recover Kronshtadt and the other members of the Polar Expedition as quickly as possible...<br>
If we can deceive the prying eyes of the Naval HQ and uncover the Sirens' secrets before they can... then the entire course of this war will change.<br>
The Commander will ultimately have to answer to someone after this operation... and that is an inevitability.<br>
<br>
Shortly before the appearance of the Sirens and the outbreak of the first great war...<br>
A meteorite fell into territory controlled by the Northern Parliament.<br>
An expedition team was dispatched to investigate the phenomenon<br>
but mysteriously vanished without a trace - equipment, fleet, and all.<br>
Unknownst to that expedition team, what they had uncovered<br>
was one piece of the truth behind the Sirens.<br>

<br>
Northern Parliament - Unknown Location<br>
Ice crackled beneath the tires of a speeding convoy, bearing the insignias of the Classified Operations Unit.<br>
The notion of shipgirls traveling not by ship but by car is understandably strange to some, but it made sense under these circumstances...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Volga：</span><br>
Don't press your face up against the window, Soobrazitelny! It'll stick if you keep it like that!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Soobrazitelny：</span><br>
No problem, I've already calculated the length of time I can do this for!<br>
Even if it happens, it'll be worth it for this priceless view!<br>
<br>
A monochrome world stretched on with no end in sight outside the window, the horizon bisected by a vast night sky and endless fields of pristine snow.<br>
The convoy was headed for a Northern Parliament base. Situated near the pole, it is a vital logistics center in their fight against the Sirens.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Soobrazitelny：</span><br>
Drat, the window's starting to fog up on the outside... We won't be able to enjoy the scenery at this rate.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kronshtadt：</span><br>
We're here to conduct a secret mission, not gaze at the landscape. And inclement weather is perfect for that.<br>
If you ask me, not being able to see out the window is a small price to pay for not being stuck outside in the cold.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Soobrazitelny：</span><br>
You have a point! I'm glad to be in here where it's warm rather than out there freezing my– Dang it, the window fogged up again!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kronshtadt：</span><br>
To that we owe Soyuz. This mission would've been far less pleasant if not for her.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Volga：</span><br>
Hey, Soobrazitelny, isn't it past your bedtime? Be a good girl and go to sleep!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Soobrazitelny：</span><br>
It's only 7 o'clock, you doofus! Only sloths sleep at this hour!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Volga：</span><br>
You're right it is! Sorry, I just felt like I had to point it out since you're acting so giddy after dinner~<br>
You should still sleep though to recharge your batteries. The mission is tomorrow, you know?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Soobrazitelny：</span><br>
I know, but this view is too good to pass on! You can go to bed without me!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Volga：</span><br>
Sorry, what view? The window's practically opaque.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Soobrazitelny：</span><br>
You never know if it might clear up soon! I can sleep later anyway! Go put Kiev to sleep or something!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kiev：</span><br>
......<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Volga：</span><br>
What's wrong, Kiev? Can't sleep? Are you getting carsick?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kiev：</span><br>
Yeah... I'm used to rocking waves, but not bumpy roads...<br>
Why couldn't we have gone by ship instead? I hate this...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Volga：</span><br>
To be honest, I'm not sure. All I know is Soyuz wanted it this way.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Soobrazitelny：</span><br>
If I had to guess, it's because sailing a ship through this weather would be exhausting and too damaging to the vessel!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kronshtadt：</span><br>
Not quite. This is all for the sake of secrecy.<br>
Our destination is a top-secret research base in Arctic waters. We can't afford to be spotted.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Soobrazitelny：</span><br>
What? I thought we were only going to patrol an ice-free port?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kronshtadt：</span><br>
Use your head, please. We wouldn't need to stay overnight if we were only going on a patrol, would we?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Soobrazitelny：</span><br>
So we're on a secret mission, then... Hahaha! Fantastic! I wonder what kind of machines they've got there!<br>
On the topic of ice-free ports, how many do we have, again? There's the port of Murmansk for a start, then to the south there's Arkhangelsk, then–<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kiev：</span><br>
Ugh... Could you be quiet, please?<br>
<br>
Just then, a door connecting the vehicle's front and rear cabins opened with a click.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Arkhangelsk：</span><br>
Did someone say my name?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Soobrazitelny：</span><br>
Well... Yes, but actually no! I was talking about the port of the same name!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Arkhangelsk：</span><br>
Ah, I see. Incidentally, what are you all doing up this late?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kronshtadt：</span><br>
Killing time, I suppose. Have you seen anything out there?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Arkhangelsk：</span><br>
Nothing but hills of snow. Seems it's only us out here.<br>
Not that anyone would be able to spot us out here. And if they somehow did, they still wouldn't know we're the passengers.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kronshtadt：</span><br>
Then everything's going all according to plan.<br>
So... Considering how long the nights are this far north, I propose we all do as Volga said and sleep to prepare for tomorrow.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Volga：</span><br>
Mhm! Early to bed, early to rise, like well-behaved children do!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Soobrazitelny：</span><br>
Fine, fine!<br>

<br>
The following day...<br>
A small, isolated train station came into view among all the snow, and the convoy finally came to a stop.<br>
They parked next to the station building, from which emerged a woman donning a distinct Northern Parliament coat.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Avrora：</span><br>
Hello, everyone. How are you all feeling after such a long and arduous journey?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Soobrazitelny：</span><br>
Well, if it isn't Avrora! I'm feeling just fine!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kronshtadt：</span><br>
I recognize this station. Quite the historic building, isn't it?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Avrora：</span><br>
That it is. It had fallen into disuse, so we repurposed it into a stopover point. It's quite useful, actually.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Arkhangelsk：</span><br>
Is it? There's nothing else around here, though.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Avrora：</span><br>
There isn't, but do you see this map? If you follow it... Well, it won't take you to your destination, but it will lead you to the last leg of your journey.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Arkhangelsk：</span><br>
Wow, Kronshtadt sure was right about the base being far out of the way...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Avrora：</span><br>
Mhm. That's all the help I can give, I'm afraid. Good luck on the rest of your journey!<br>
<br>
Northern Parliament - Secret Naval Base<br>
The convoy followed the markings on the map, traveling for hours through the snow.<br>
Arriving at their destination, they found a small naval base with several out-of-use facilities... and a gigantic submarine berthed in the nearby waters.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Volga：</span><br>
Who would've thought we built a port all the way out here...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Arkhangelsk：</span><br>
One that doesn't freeze over, at that. I suppose this is the place we're meant to patrol?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Soobrazitelny：</span><br>
Look there! What is that giant mech– No, wait, it's a giant submarine?! I've never seen anything like it before!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kiev：</span><br>
Kronshtadt, you know something about this, don't you? Mind telling us?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kronshtadt：</span><br>
I've heard some rumors. They say this was used in the exploration of the Arcana Sanctum, but that can't be true.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
Sometimes rumors do stem from the truth. Well done making it out here.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kronshtadt：</span><br>
Soyuz?! Is that you?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
Yes, it is me. Welcome to our command submarine development site.<br>
I'm somehow not surprised by your subdued reaction. You already knew about this project, despite its top-secret nature.<br>
You may think you simply stumbled across the intel, but I believe one of the higher-ups leaked it. I'll have to look into this matter more closely at a later date.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kronshtadt：</span><br>
No, truly, all of what I know about the project is guesswork and speculation–<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
There's no need to explain yourself. Knowing you, you heard of it purely through some strange accident. Am I correct?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kronshtadt：</span><br>
As embarrassing as it is to admit... Yeah...<br>
I have to say though, this submarine is a marvel to view in person. Our mission here is going to involve it somehow, right?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
Indeed it is. You are going to pilot it yourselves.<br>
But first, I should tell you a little more about this beauty. Please listen closely.<br>
She is a special type of submarine, designed to analyze Siren relics deep beneath the sea.<br>
In place of armaments, she has a vast array of instruments and equipment that makes her better suited for deep-sea environments.<br>
She can fulfill the role of an icebreaker on the surface while retaining all the capabilities of a full-fledged submarine, making her the ideal vehicle for our purposes here.<br>
Her massive internal space allows her to carry a large amount of equipment and weapons without sacrificing the comfort of the crew.<br>
There is only one in existence as of now, which will serve as the Commander's escort vessel, but I do plan to mass-produce this model.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Soobrazitelny：</span><br>
Great Scott! So this giant beast is something of a prototype, isn't she?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
Correct.<br>
Like all mass-produced vessels, she's a poor substitute for a shipgirl. Still, I am very confident in her usefulness as an auxiliary vessel.<br>
Gathering data on how she operates in practice will be part of your mission here.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Arkhangelsk：</span><br>
Never thought I'd one day serve as a submarine test pilot...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
Of course, I've done everything I can to attune your research equipment, reinforce the hull armor, and calibrate onboard life support systems...<br>
But I'm afraid you won't get many opportunities to investigate Siren tech without the Naval HQ breathing down your neck.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Volga：</span><br>
But that's just what we're going to do, right? Pilot this submarine and investigate a Siren facility?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
That's right. You have a daunting task ahead of you, but I will pray for your success.<br>
There is a decoy research base in this region. You will head there as part of this operation, but your real objective lies–<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Soobrazitelny：</span><br>
Woooow, this submarine is AWESOME! I NEED to see how it looks inside!<br>
Permission to enter her, please! Please?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
Denied. Please let me finish explaining.<br>
Kronshtadt may already know most of this, but I don't believe you'll be able to fulfill your mission without knowing what it is you need to do, Soobrazitelny.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Soobrazitelny：</span><br>
R-right... Haha, sorry...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
...As I was about to say: your real objective lies deep beneath the surface.<br>
The research base I just spoke of is only a glorified stage prop, but it does house important equipment that you are to bring with you to your real objective.<br>
Your visit to the base serves to create an alibi while also diverting attention from the true purpose of this operation.<br>
As for what your real objective is... Well, I'm sure you already know.<br>
You'll find instruction manuals inside the submarine. They'll tell you how to operate the equipment and where you need to go. I suggest you all read them on the way there.<br>
Now, I'd like to reiterate – we likely won't get another opportunity like this.<br>
The Northern Parliament's future rests on your shoulders, everyone. Bear that in mind all throughout this mission.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kronshtadt：</span><br>
Good thing this is exactly the kind of mission I've been looking forward to.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
You can engage any Sirens you come across if you so wish, but please do everything in your power to return safely.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kronshtadt：</span><br>
Relax, Soyuz, you've picked the right person for the job.<br>
You have other business to attend to, don't you? You shouldn't keep the others waiting.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
Indeed I do. I'm putting my faith in you here, Kronshtadt.<br>
You won't have much time to complete your mission, but don't make rash decisions. Proceed forward calmly and carefully.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kronshtadt：</span><br>
Got it. We'll be back before you know it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
Best of luck to you all.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Soobrazitelny：</span><br>
Wait! Before I start tinkering with the sub... Does she have a name?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
Ah, she does. Apologies, I forgot to tell you.<br>
Her name is Suliko.<br>
It reflects her purpose – to record data, analyze technology, and discover the source of our "souls" as shipgirls.<br>
A nice name, wouldn't you agree?<br>

Polar Region - Northern Parliament Waters<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Soobrazitelny：</span><br>
Speed and angle looking good... Engine output stable...<br>
Wow! This is all incredible! Oh, how I'd love to take this beauty apart and examine the components!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Volga：</span><br>
Goodness me, you're like a kid in a candy shop~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kiev：</span><br>
A kid in a candy shop her parents own...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Soobrazitelny：</span><br>
Oh boy, I wonder what happens if I tweak these parameters just a smidge!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kiev：</span><br>
She's too engrossed in the machinery to even deny the fact she's acting like a kid...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Arkhangelsk：</span><br>
Having fun with the sub, are you, Soobrazitelny?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Soobrazitelny：</span><br>
Yes! I'm having the time of my frickin' life!<br>
...Wait, I forgot that we're on the clock! We have a job to do!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Arkhangelsk：</span><br>
Before we do, I have a question for you, Miss Genius Mechanic.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Soobrazitelny：</span><br>
Let's hear it! Assuming it's about machines, I know everything there is to know!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Arkhangelsk：</span><br>
No, it's about the port the sub was docked in.<br>
Specifically about the fact it wasn't frozen over. Geographically speaking, that should be impossible, no?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Soobrazitelny：</span><br>
Should it? Hmm... Wait, I think I know the answer!<br>
Remember those little buoy-like things we saw floating in the water back at the port?<br>
My theory is that they are machines which regulate the water's temperature to stop it from freezing!<br>
See those cables extending to the surface? I bet they connect the heating element to some sort of machine further down below!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Arkhangelsk：</span><br>
That... makes a surprising amount of sense. I really didn't expect you'd have an answer.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Soobrazitelny：</span><br>
Didn't you hear me? I know everything there is to know about machines! Ahh-ha-ha-haah!<br>
...Wait, you weren't expecting an answer? So you asked just for the hell of it?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Arkhangelsk：</span><br>
Yeah, and I learned something new for it. While we're on the topic of machines...<br>
Don't you think it's astonishing how things once thought impossible were made possible thanks to Cube technology? Including warming the waters around an entire port.<br>
All that energy, generated by a device small enough to fit in the palm of your hand. I can't even imagine a world without Cubes.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Soobrazitelny：</span><br>
The port certainly could not exist without them! This region has neither the geography nor resources to support one without the usage of Cube technology.<br>
Maaan, now I want to get my hands on one of those buoys, take it apart, and see what's inside!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kronshtadt：</span><br>
Don't even think about it. The buoys are Northern Parliament property.<br>
Having fun with the sub, are you, Soobrazitelny?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Soobrazitelny：</span><br>
Arkhangelsk said almost the exact same thing...<br>
Yeah, I'd take off like a rocket if it wasn't for the fact that I have a job to do! Speaking of which...<br>
Moored vessel spotted to our front! It appears unarmed – most likely an icebreaker!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kronshtadt：</span><br>
Let me have a look... I can just make out its name. "Mikoyan."<br>
Exactly where the mission papers said it would be. This icebreaker will guide us to the research base.<br>
Get in gear, everyone. We're about to arrive.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Soobrazitelny：</span><br>
Does anyone else wonder why we're still fielding icebreakers when we've got those heating buoys?<br>
"In with the new but keep the old," I suppose. Maybe the research base will be a mix of old and new as well.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Volga：</span><br>
There's no need to retire the icebreakers if they still work, no? That'd be a waste.<br>
I wonder what we should expect to find inside the research base... Do you know anything about it, Kronshtadt?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kronshtadt：</span><br>
What I do know is hard to explain... Don't worry though, you'll soon see for yourself.<br>

<br>
Polar Region - Northern Parliament Research Base<br>
The girls sailed onward, using the moored icebreaker as a landmark. Not long after, an enormous structure reared its peak over the horizon.<br>
Its hypermodern design was reminiscent of a majestic chapel, or perhaps a rocket launch pad. It towered silently over the ice field surrounding it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Volga：</span><br>
It seems safe to assume that's the research base.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kiev：</span><br>
Doesn't look like something built by humanity... It feels threatening...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kronshtadt：</span><br>
No surprise you get that impression, considering who DID build it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kiev：</span><br>
Huh...? What do you mean by that?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kronshtadt：</span><br>
Simply put, this used to be a Siren facility. It was abandoned and in ruins when we found it, so we decided to rebuild it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Soobrazitelny：</span><br>
We did what? That sounds way too risky!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kronshtadt：</span><br>
It was worth the risk. This place is vital to our operations out here.<br>
We don't have the resources to build a facility from scratch, but we need a base to function as a stopping point in order to dive down.<br>
The Sirens gave us free real estate here; it would be foolish not to take full advantage of it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kiev：</span><br>
Do I have to go inside? I'd rather stay out here...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Soobrazitelny：</span><br>
Why? What are you afraid of?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kiev：</span><br>
I'm not afraid. It just feels like it's dangerous to go near it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kronshtadt：</span><br>
That's what it means to be afraid, Kiev. Tell you what – everyone who's going in, assemble on the deck.<br>
Kiev and Soobrazitelny, you'll stay here and guard the sub. You never know when Sirens might appear.<br>
And Volga, you're on babysitting duty. You can all patrol the sector if you want, but don't get lost. This place is bigger than I expected.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kiev：</span><br>
Okay. We should be fine if we use the icebreaker as a landmark.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kronshtadt：</span><br>
Good. I'd be astonished if you managed to lose track of an ordinary vessel in an area littered with Siren structures.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kiev：</span><br>
Then we have a plan. I'll start scouting the waters around the submarine after we've dropped you off.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Soobrazitelny：</span><br>
I can see the base's pier! Initiating docking sequence!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kronshtadt：</span><br>
Perfect. Time to get cracking, team!<br>

Northern Parliament Research Base - Submarine Anchorage Point<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Volga：</span><br>
Whew... I'm done loading the equipment! Kiev, do you have the courage to at least get up on the pier?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Soobrazitelny：</span><br>
I'm telling you, she's a complete scaredy-cat. Sure it's an ex-Siren facility, but so what? It's been rebuilt from top to bottom!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kiev：</span><br>
I'm not a scaredy-cat, I'm just cautious... Did you notice anything unusual inside the base?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Soobrazitelny：</span><br>
Nope! But I did find a whole factory's worth of broken machines. I wish I could hole up in there and tinker on them for three months straight!<br>
We've GOT to return here after this mission's over!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Volga：</span><br>
The question is whether we'll get permission to... It could be worth asking Kronshtadt about it.<br>
Not now though, since she's in a meeting with Arkhangelsk. Based on how serious they both looked, I think they're discussing the mission...<br>
<br>
Suliko Interior - Lounge Area<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kronshtadt：</span><br>
...Interesting. I never would've guessed that's what's going on in the Royal Navy.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Arkhangelsk：</span><br>
Shocking, isn't it? Tell that to a member of the aristocracy and they'll spit their tea.<br>
What about you? Have you heard anything that'll amaze me?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kronshtadt：</span><br>
I hear about all kinds of things. You're going to have to be more specific than that.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Arkhangelsk：</span><br>
How about something I don't already know, for starters?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kronshtadt：</span><br>
...How am I supposed to know what you don't know?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Arkhangelsk：</span><br>
Now you're being silly. How would I ask a question about what I don't know about?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kronshtadt：</span><br>
You're missing the point. How would I know what you do or do not know?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Arkhangelsk：</span><br>
For the love of... I don't know what to ask about because I don't know what I don't know.<br>
Well, this isn't getting anywhere. Let me try phrasing it differently... How about you tell me something that only you know?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kronshtadt：</span><br>
Why didn't you say that in the first place?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Arkhangelsk：</span><br>
Why didn't you just answer a simple question instead of dancing around it?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kronshtadt：</span><br>
It's called rhetoric, my friend. It's an important skill to have if you plan on dealing with those aristocrats.<br>
Anyway, no more games. You are someone I can trust with what I'm about to tell you.<br>
Something that you would have no knowledge of, something that only I know–<br>
One way you can make black tea taste better is by putting a whole slice of lemon into your teacup and letting it rest for–<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Arkhangelsk：</span><br>
Adding lemon to black tea?! That's disgusting! Nobody in the Royal Navy would do that! Who told you this? The Iron Blood?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kronshtadt：</span><br>
That's classified. But I can tell you this is apparently a popular practice in the Iron Blood.<br>
Thinking about it now, that may be a signal used by those in my field... You should watch yourself around anyone who adds lemon to black tea, Arkhangelsk.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Arkhangelsk：</span><br>
Believe me, I'd steer clear of anyone who poisons their own tea like that. Yuck.<br>
Honestly? You should keep this to yourself, lest you get put on the Royal Navy's wanted list for crimes against tea.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kronshtadt：</span><br>
I don't plan on sharing it with anyone else. This information is only meant for those in the know.<br>
Although... by divulging it to you just now, I've already let an outsider in on the fact...<br>
I've no reason to think you WOULD leak this information. I trust you, but you must be very careful so as to not accidentally give it away to an agent with...<br>
...Why the weird look? Are you not taking me seriously?<br>

<br>
The sudden blaring of sirens interrupted the banter between the two ships.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kronshtadt：</span><br>
What's happening?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Soobrazitelny：</span><br>
Kronshtadt! We're picking up Siren signatures! They're headed our way!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kronshtadt：</span><br>
How many? Volga, have you sent out any recons yet?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Volga：</span><br>
I have! I'll try to get some more out in a moment–<br>
It seems there's only a handful of them. What's more, they don't appear to have their course set on us – we just happen to be in their path.<br>
I believe our mass-produced ships stationed at the research base will be enough to deal with them.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kronshtadt：</span><br>
Most likely. Still, we ought to eliminate them ourselves. Think of it as a warmup.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Arkhangelsk：</span><br>
Warmup for what?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kronshtadt：</span><br>
Our objective – that Siren relic – is bound to have more than a handful of Sirens guarding it, so why not test our tactics in a comparatively safe environment?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Soobrazitelny：</span><br>
She's right, you know! We need to get into the swing of fighting while defending the Suliko!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Volga：</span><br>
Kiev and I agree wholeheartedly! I'll keep my planes on them so we don't lose track of–<br>
Hey... Everyone, look at the sky!<br>
<br>
The girls gathered on the deck looked up and saw a night sky with curtains of silver-blue light slowly fluttering high above.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Soobrazitelny：</span><br>
An aurora! What a spectacular and rare sight!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kiev：</span><br>
Agreed...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Soobrazitelny：</span><br>
Say, Kiev, believe it or not, but I have a question for you! Do you know how auroras are formed?<br>
This is admittedly a gap in my knowledge and I thought, "Hey, Kiev is the quiet type, so she likely knows more than she lets on!"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kiev：</span><br>
...That's a stereotype about introverts. Quiet people aren't always smart.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Soobrazitelny：</span><br>
Shh! The genius mechanic asked you a question! What you just gave me is not an answer, but a sidenote!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kiev：</span><br>
...It so happens I do know. Auroras are the result of fast-moving charged particles from the sun colliding with air particulars in the planet's magnetic field. Does that make sense to you?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Volga：</span><br>
The explanation is lost on me, I'm afraid. All I know is these lights are gorgeous~ I should make a wish to the aurora!<br>
<br>
Volga put her hands together and whispered a wish to the sky.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Volga：</span><br>
(Please, watch over my friends and let our mission here go without a hitch.)<br>
<br>
At that exact moment, the Suliko's sensors picked up a distress signal from an unknown source...<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

<br>
Northern Parliament Research Base - Nearby Waters<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kiev：</span><br>
This is it... The place the distress signal came from.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Volga：</span><br>
Is everyone all right? You're not hurt, are you, Kiev?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kiev：</span><br>
We're all fine, I think. I made sure of that.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Soobrazitelny：</span><br>
"We're all fine, I made sure of that"... In the most reckless way possible! You'd have gotten seriously hurt if we were fighting a real Siren fleet!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kiev：</span><br>
Don't parrot me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Soobrazitelny：</span><br>
Listen, I'm trying to tell you not to rush in alone or you'll get yourself killed!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kiev：</span><br>
But I didn't get myself killed, so it's fine.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kronshtadt：</span><br>
Seems the warmup was to everyone's benefit. That was some nice teamwork out there.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Soobrazitelny：</span><br>
And the Suliko didn't get as much as a scratch! All in a day's work!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Volga：</span><br>
I was a little nervous at first, but in the end I managed to gain control of the skies~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Arkhangelsk：</span><br>
Hmm... No signs of a fight, and no wreckage either. As crazy as it sounds, I think the signal is coming from underwater.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kronshtadt：</span><br>
Right, the signal. Its signature didn't match anything used within the Northern Parliament, so it's anyone's guess as to who's calling for help.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Arkhangelsk：</span><br>
Not even you have any idea who it could be? Goodness...<br>
What's strange is that the signal's source isn't far from the objective... Reckon that's a coincidence?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kronshtadt：</span><br>
Oh, you're right. It's practically close enough to park the submarine next to.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kiev：</span><br>
So what do we do now? I doubt we'll find any leads here on the surface.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Soobrazitelny：</span><br>
What do you think? We must go deeper, of course!<br>
We could be walking into a Siren trap, but the only way we'll find out is by diving with the sub and investigating. So I propose we do just that!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kronshtadt：</span><br>
True, and we have to test her diving performance anyway! Let's get ready to go down.<br>
(Good thing we eliminated all the Sirens first before going underwater. Because once we do, we can't fight back.)<br>
(Smashing up the place, then vanishing without a trace. Just the way I like it.)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Soobrazitelny：</span><br>
Hold on tight, everyone! Initiating diving sequence!<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

<br>
Investigation Site - Depth: 200 Meters<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Soobrazitelny：</span><br>
Current depth 200 meters, holding steady!<br>
Terminating diving sequence and switching to manual steering!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kronshtadt：</span><br>
Manual? You sure that's a good idea?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Soobrazitelny：</span><br>
It'll be fine! There's still a ways to go until the objective, and this is a good opportunity to get some steering practice in!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kronshtadt：</span><br>
Do you remember what the operator's manual said?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Soobrazitelny：</span><br>
There's nothing to worry about! Did you forget I'm a genius mechanic?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kronshtadt：</span><br>
Do you remember what the operator's manual said?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Soobrazitelny：</span><br>
Uh... I said it'll be fine! I've piloted mass-produced subs in the past!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kronshtadt：</span><br>
Do you remember what the operator's manual said?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Soobrazitelny：</span><br>
I'll... go read it again...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kronshtadt：</span><br>
Didn't think so. Go on, shoo.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kiev：</span><br>
I'm a little worried... Our riggings are no use underwater...<br>
If Sirens turn up, we'll be sitting ducks...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kronshtadt：</span><br>
We knew the risks when we took on this mission. Worst-case scenario, we'll just resurface at once and fight them above water.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Arkhangelsk：</span><br>
Mhm. If the Suliko sinks, we go down with her, so no underwater engagements.<br>
Let's see what the notes say... Interesting. "The specimen is unstable. Do not attempt to move it outside the site of discovery."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kronshtadt：</span><br>
Unstable? Are we dealing with something radioactive here?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Arkhangelsk：</span><br>
Not quite. Apparently, if you move the meteorite – i.e. the specimen – far from where you found it, its unique properties vanish.<br>
"Fragments of the meteorite display this same unstable behavior; when removed from the site of discovery, they too undergo structural change."<br>
"For this reason, it is theorized that the specimen can only be studied in a research site constructed on-location, or through remote observation."<br>
And that's why they're sending us down in a submarine. We don't have much other choice.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Volga：</span><br>
Wait, I'm getting confused... What are we studying? A relic? A meteorite? Could someone please explain?<br>
You know, I think I'll have another look at the mission briefing...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Arkhangelsk：</span><br>
No need. Stay here and I'll explain so we're all on the same page.<br>
Kronshtadt may be able to weigh in with what she knows too, but at this point I don't trust her to have all the facts straight.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kronshtadt：</span><br>
Your words sting like a branding iron...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Arkhangelsk：</span><br>
To start with the meteorite, that's our objective. Once the submarine reaches the coordinates, we're going to analyze it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Volga：</span><br>
I see...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Arkhangelsk：</span><br>
We would simply haul the meteorite back to the surface if we could, but apparently it likes it down there.<br>
So instead, we'll come to it and study it with our instruments to gather data. Am I on the mark, Kronshtadt?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kronshtadt：</span><br>
Everything you said is correct. Now let me interject and tell you what I know about the meteorite.<br>
Its story begins just before the last Great War took place, when a massive explosion went off over the Northern Parliament.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Volga：</span><br>
I've heard about this! Apparently, the explosion was so big that the shockwave shattered windows even a thousand kilometers away.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kronshtadt：</span><br>
Yes. Its butterfly-shaped blast pattern had scientists believing it was caused by a meteorite for the longest time.<br>
This was backed up by eyewitnesses who reported seeing a giant fireball fall from the sky, as well as the discovery of what seemed to be a crater at the explosion's epicenter.<br>
But upon further examination of the crater, researchers were unable to find any meteorites or even traces of an actual impact.<br>
A meteorite impact was the only sound explanation, but without any evidence to support this theory, it quickly fell out of favor.<br>
Now, what I'm about to tell you is strictly classified: a few days before the explosion, "Sirens" appeared near the blast zone.<br>
Following the explosion, unidentified flying objects were seen passing over the site, later thought to be Siren aircraft.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kiev：</span><br>
Sirens? Out there...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kronshtadt：</span><br>
Of course, humanity didn't know about the Sirens back then. As such, the reports were regarded as typical UFO sightings and largely written off.<br>
Some time after that, the Siren base we visited earlier was first discovered. However, it wasn't until after the war with the Sirens broke out that people made the connection between them and that huge explosion.<br>
As for why nothing was found at the site, the Sirens likely got to it before we did.<br>
Which finally brings us to what we're looking for. According to my sources, the original meteorite broke into several fragments, one of which fell into the sea.<br>
You'd think the Sirens would've recovered it too by now, but since its unique properties vanish when it's moved, I suppose they decided to leave it be.<br>
And since it's not going anywhere, they probably decided that it's also unnecessary to keep a permanent defensive system around it.<br>
...Or at least, that's my best guess from reading between the lines of our mission briefing.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Volga：</span><br>
So... The Sirens built a stronghold to guard the meteorite, but later realized that's not necessary and abandoned it?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kronshtadt：</span><br>
I believe so, yes. Back in the last Great War that Avrora fought in, humanity captured several Siren strongholds, and even discovered a few Siren ruins after the war.<br>
The base we visited is one of them, as is the underwater city. I believe it's named... "Arcana Sanctum."<br>
As nobody knew about the meteorite back when we captured the base, our researchers focused mainly on the tech the Sirens had left behind.<br>
The tech they successfully reverse-engineered was then integrated into the riggings we use now.<br>
Later on, with the discovery of the meteorite, we finally realized why the Sirens built that stronghold in the middle of nowhere. And that's how this mission came to be.<br>
I've no doubt in my mind Soyuz must've languished for ages over how to reach the meteorite while avoiding the Sirens and Naval HQ's prying eyes.<br>
The opportunity she'd waited for finally presented itself with the completion of the Suliko and the waning Siren presence in the area.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kiev：</span><br>
I never knew the base played such an important role...<br>
Now I feel bad for thinking so little of it before...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kronshtadt：</span><br>
I don't blame you for it. We've already salvaged everything worth analyzing from it anyway.<br>
As powerful as Siren tech is, we mustn't forget its ruinous influence. Just look what it did to the Crimson Axis.<br>
However, we needn't pursue Siren tech in our quest for answers. Where do Sirens draw their strength from? Where do we shipgirls draw OUR strength from? Finding those answers is of great importance.<br>
And Soyuz... The fact that she personally traveled to meet us instead of sending an envoy shows just how important she thinks this mission is.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Arkhangelsk：</span><br>
That explains why she put a big shot like you on the case, too.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Volga：</span><br>
Excuse me, but... how did we discover that there was a meteorite out here anyway?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Arkhangelsk：</span><br>
Well, it was found–<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kronshtadt：</span><br>
By complete accident. You won't locate a meteorite chunk in an ocean using divers and sonar.<br>
Remember the huge explosion I spoke of earlier? Scientists observed that the insects and trees around the blast zone were suffering from abnormalities.<br>
"And?" you ask? These strange phenomena were also observed in the species endemic to this area where the meteorite rests.<br>
Fish had begun mutating and coral reefs were turning into crystal. Just like what happened to those insects and trees.<br>
This prompted a team from the research base to follow the bread crumb trail of abnormalities, who then pinpointed the meteorite's location.<br>
I reckon it was around this time they also found out that bringing meteorite bits outside the area they're discovered turns them inert.<br>
The briefing says those specimens can, optionally, be recovered. I say we might as well, even if it's not our main goal here.<br>
So, if you were only half-paying attention, in summary...<br>
One: the meteorite in this region is only a chunk from a bigger one, and for some strange reason, doesn't want to be moved much.<br>
Two: that research base is simply a prop for our cover story. With no more tech left to salvage from it, it's practically worthless.<br>
Three: our mission here is to examine the aforementioned meteorite chunk up-close and gather data on it. Any questions?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Volga：</span><br>
None from me~ Thank you for the outstanding explanation, Kronshtadt! Thumbs up!<br>
...Wait, I just thought of one. By "examine" you don't mean literally staring at it through the Suliko's windows, right...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kronshtadt：</span><br>
Obviously not. We're going to use the specialized equipment we retrieved at the base before.<br>
Speaking of which, that equipment is all 100 percent Siren tech. Handle it with caution.<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Soobrazitelny：</span><br>
Good day my fellow crewmates, this is Captain Soobrazitelny speaking. We're now at a depth of 500 meters and will arrive at the objective shortly!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Arkhangelsk：</span><br>
500 meters... That's crazy when you think about it.<br>
Speaking of crazy, did our favorite genius mechanic really get promoted to captain by piloting it for a short while?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kronshtadt：</span><br>
Let her have her fun. You know how she is – when she finds a shiny new toy to play with, she becomes fixated on it.<br>
Captain Soobrazitelny, do you have a read on the meteorite's exact location yet?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Soobrazitelny：</span><br>
I'm picking up some sort of reading, but I can't tell you where it's coming from with all our sensors going haywire!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Volga：</span><br>
It seems we're not making much progress...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kronshtadt：</span><br>
I anticipated our sensors would start acting up the deeper down we went, but not to THIS extent.<br>
And with our radio connection to the base severed, we're as good as dead if disaster strikes.<br>
...Wait a moment. Comms not working, sensors malfunctioning... You've gotta be kidding me.<br>
Soobrazitelny! Switch the sub over to soundless mode right now! Bash any sound-producing equipment into silence if you must, just do it!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Soobrazitelny：</span><br>
Why would I do... Oh! We're in a Mirror Sea?! I'm on it!<br>
<br>
A few hectic moments later...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Soobrazitelny：</span><br>
There are submarine-type Sirens straight above us... Have they always been able to operate at depths this great?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kronshtadt：</span><br>
It's possible, but then we couldn't have known since nobody's gone this deep in a vessel before.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Arkhangelsk：</span><br>
Think about that – that's invaluable intel. Even if we turn back right now, we won't be leaving empty-handed.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kronshtadt：</span><br>
Even so, what are the implications of a Siren presence down here? Did they finally decide to retrieve the meteorite?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Arkhangelsk：</span><br>
They could be, which would be really bad news.<br>
With no armaments on this sub to speak of, there's not much we can do about it either.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kiev：</span><br>
Won't we be fine if we just go back up and fight them on the surface?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kronshtadt：</span><br>
Not happening. If they spot us while we're resurfacing, it's all over.<br>
Hmm... Soobrazitelny, what equipment did we lose in the process of you breaking them?<br>
Choose something that's fragile and buoyant. I'm thinking we can eject something through the sub's stern, then make our escape while the Sirens are distracted by it.<br>
<br>
Kronshtadt looked at Soobrazitelny and proposed to her a desperate, daring plan.<br>
Caught 500 meters beneath the surface with enemies all around, the pressure was bearing down on the girls...<br>
A few hectic moments later...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kronshtadt：</span><br>
Do you think they've gone away yet?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Arkhangelsk：</span><br>
Who can say? Our equipment's only quiet because it's broken.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kronshtadt：</span><br>
We can't stall our engines forever at this depth, and we're going to run out of oxygen eventually if we don't get away from those damn Sirens.<br>
My decoy plan is by no means foolproof, but all we can do is pray that it works...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Soobrazitelny：</span><br>
Picking up Siren movements! I think... Yes, those submarines from before are resurfacing!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Volga：</span><br>
Do you think they took the bait? Phew...<br>
Thank goodness... I was so sure we were done for...!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kronshtadt：</span><br>
You did well by staying calm, Volga. And by keeping Kiev's and our Captain's spirits up.<br>
The crisis is over now, but we can't simply resurface here or we'll run right into Sirens again.<br>
So here's what we're going to do - continue the search. They'll be hesitant to fire torpedoes at us as long as we stay close to the meteorite survey site.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Soobrazitelny：</span><br>
Ooh, clever! And if they try it anyway, we'll just ram them into oblivion!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kiev：</span><br>
Did you hit yourself on the head? Heck no, we're not doing that.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Soobrazitelny：</span><br>
Hey, I'm just messing with you! I'm not dumb! Anyway, let's get this mission back on track!<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=Into the Abyss|选项=11|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Soobrazitelny：</span><br>
There it is! Picking up a reading! Patching up errant data... Aaand done! I've located a meteorite fragment, everyone!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kronshtadt：</span><br>
Outstanding! Now it's time to begin the synchronization procedure.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Soobrazitelny：</span><br>
Will do! Finally I get to use the grappling hands on this baby!<br>
Watch this – I'm about to pick up this fragment with the most precise and delicate maneuver you've ever seen...<br>
Got it! Now we, uh... Hook it up to the chamber, right?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kronshtadt：</span><br>
Yup. I'll go and get started on that.<br>
Oh, by the way, I need an assistant to help me operate it. Arkhangelsk, can I count on you?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Arkhangelsk：</span><br>
Absolutely. I've got the manual right here in case I'll need it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kronshtadt：</span><br>
Great. Then you and I will head over now and start the data-gathering process. We may be gone for some time, just so you all know.<br>
Captain, keep on piloting the sub. Kiev, keep an eye on our surroundings. And Volga, in the case of an emergency, you're in command.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Volga：</span><br>
Understood~ We'll hold the fort while you're gone. Be careful with the equipment over there!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kronshtadt：</span><br>
Of course. Hehehe, this is the moment of truth...<br>
<br>
Suliko Interior - Synchronization Chamber<br>
The small synchronization chamber was filled with instruments, big screens, and control panels, in stark contrast to the barren, functional interiors of the rest of the vessel.<br>
Kronshtadt lay down in a chair resembling a dental engine, and Arkhangelsk took a seat next to her.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Arkhangelsk：</span><br>
This is almost like a doctor's office.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kronshtadt：</span><br>
Doctor's office? Seems more like a hi-tech interrogation room to me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Arkhangelsk：</span><br>
Been to a lot of interrogation rooms, have you, hmm? That's quite a dubious comparison to draw.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kronshtadt：</span><br>
Oh please... If there's anything dubious in this room, it's this damned machine.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Arkhangelsk：</span><br>
True. The manual Soyuz gave us is very sparse on details, too... I'm not sure this'll go well.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kronshtadt：</span><br>
Well, too late to back out now. Got any vodka on you?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Arkhangelsk：</span><br>
What? Are you seriously thinking about getting plastered?<br>
We're on duty here. I won't stop you if you must, but I will make note of it in my report.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kronshtadt：</span><br>
Please, it was a joke. I just need something to distract me from the thought that this machine might do me in.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Arkhangelsk：</span><br>
Sorry, allow me to play along then. "Why yes, I do. Only the finest for you, Miss Kronshtadt."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kronshtadt：</span><br>
"Thanks, Arkhangelsk. I raise a toast to good luck. Bottom's up."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Soobrazitelny：</span><br>
Everything's good on our end, Kronshtadt! You can start the synchronization process now!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kronshtadt：</span><br>
Got it! Guess that means it's time I put this... helmet-slash-headset thing on.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Arkhangelsk：</span><br>
Yup. Let me do one final check. Artifact is in place... Computer systems online... Data transfer port set to open...<br>
All right. Initiating in 3... 2... 1... Now!<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=Holiday Getaway|选项=12|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<br>
Kronshtadt's mind floated through a pure white void.<br>
Moments ago she lay in an uncomfortable chair inside a dreary room. Now it was as though she'd left her own body and soared through the sky.<br>
The experience felt a lot like downing an entire barrel of vodka then getting carted through a desert of snow and ice.<br>
All of a sudden, she was blasted with countless packets of data. Images coalesced into a pixelated mess and overlapping voices became indiscernible from static noise.<br>
How long was she exposed to that storm of information? Seconds? Hours? There's no telling.<br>
But throughout it all, she clung on to her consciousness, lest the storm engulf her. Soon she could feel her own two feet touch the ground.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kronshtadt：</span><br>
Ugghh... Why do I have the mother of all hangovers when I've not had a drop to drink...<br>
Getting drunk is the fun part, and I've skipped straight to the horrible day after part...<br>
What the hell happened? Last thing I remember, I was in the Suliko... Where am I now, and how did I get here?<br>
I can smell the sea and feel sunlight on my skin. What is this, a tropical island?<br>
I can move my body freely, but there's no weight to it. Did my soul get teleported to this place...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Arkhangelsk：</span><br>
Kronshtadt?! H-how did this happen?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kronshtadt：</span><br>
That's my line! I'm the one who was in the synchronization chair!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Arkhangelsk：</span><br>
Yeah, it makes no sense... The machine started whirring, and the next thing I know, I'm here.<br>
And we're not the only ones. Look! Soobrazitelny, Kiev, and Volga all wound up here too!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Volga：</span><br>
Mrmhh... Whuh– Where are we....?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kronshtadt：</span><br>
You tell me... This is the strangest turn of events I could imagine.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Soobrazitelny：</span><br>
I've figured it out! This is all a dream! A dream where we're in a holiday resort somewhere!<br>
Kiev, pinch my cheek as hard as you can!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kiev：</span><br>
As hard as I can? I can do that.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Soobrazitelny：</span><br>
Ow! Oww! OWWWWW! OW! STOP, STOP, TIME OUT! YOU'LL PUNCH A HOLE THROUGH IT! STOOOOOOP!<br>
Oww... That was excruciating! At least in the process, we figured out this isn't a dream since we can feel pain!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Volga：</span><br>
Aww, that sounded like it really hurt. Come here and I'll kiss the boo-boo~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Soobrazitelny：</span><br>
Owch! Look, I'm fine, I just need a minute to... Wait, I just remembered something!<br>
I've heard of an experimental technology that puts you in an ultra-vivid dream state! It even lets multiple people experience the dream concurrently!<br>
Though, this can't be it. If we moved our dream bodies, we'd bump into things in real life! That leaves but one option - this IS a dream after all...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kronshtadt：</span><br>
Stop it, Kiev. Pulling her cheeks again won't do anything but hurt her.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Arkhangelsk：</span><br>
One thing's for sure - when we manage to escape, I'll have to write a report on that machine.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kronshtadt：</span><br>
Good idea. Omit the fact I asked for vodka and write about that instead.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Soobrazitelny：</span><br>
As for the more immediate present... Does anyone know where we are?<br>
The temperature's cozy, but the humidity will make my machines rust up. I'm guessing this is some island in the southern hemisphere?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Arkhangelsk：</span><br>
Most likely. With the sea stretching on forever... Volga, can you launch some recon planes?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Volga：</span><br>
Sure can! I'll have a look-see at our surroundings~<br>
Hmm... There's another island in the distance.<br>
Don't see anything resembling a military installation... But there are lots of people in tourist clothes. Safe to say, this is a vacation destination!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Soobrazitelny：</span><br>
You're kidding! So I was right with my first guess!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Arkhangelsk：</span><br>
That puts us no closer to figuring out how we got here when we were in a submarine at the bottom of the sea just minutes ago, though.<br>
It's a pleasant change of scenery, don't get me wrong, but a lot of things don't feel right here.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kiev：</span><br>
Well, there are no enemies or danger in sight, so I guess this is fine...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Arkhangelsk：</span><br>
...Kronshtadt, what do we do?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kronshtadt：</span><br>
The briefing said to "gather data" and didn't elaborate beyond that.<br>
Likely in no small part because Soyuz couldn't predict what would happen after we synchronized...<br>
But don't worry, I'll get us out of this. Wherever we are, nobody alive expects us to be here. A spy like me couldn't ask for better circumstances than that.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Soobrazitelny：</span><br>
Very true! You are a master at gathering your bearings in unfamiliar situations, after all!<br>
Wait! You just admitted to being a spy! Not going to lie, you had this genius mechanic fooled for the longest time into thinking you weren't!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kronshtadt：</span><br>
...Perhaps the machine malfunctioned. If it did, I'm glad it at least sent us to a vacation destination. Could've been much worse.<br>
At any rate, we won't learn anything by standing around. Let's start by heading to the island Volga saw.<br>
(This whole place feels fishy. Rather than put my suspicions to rest, this tropical setting only raises them...)<br>

<span style="color:#ffd000;">???：</span><br>
Hey, you there! That area's off-limits!<br>
<br>
The Northern Parliament girls were exploring the foreign island when suddenly they were stopped by a stranger.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kiev：</span><br>
Back off!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kronshtadt：</span><br>
Don't shoot, Kiev! She's a civilian!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kiev：</span><br>
...Sorry. Instinct took over.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Volga：</span><br>
Gosh, I'm terribly sorry! I hope we didn't scare you.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">???：</span><br>
Nah, it's all good. My bad for calling out to you out of nowhere.<br>
<br>
The stranger emerged from a roadside thicket, revealing herself. She was dressed much differently to them.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">???：</span><br>
Plus, I'm not a civilian. I don't scare that easily<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Arkhangelsk：</span><br>
Interesting uniform... Do you mind telling us your name and where we are?<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Bon Homme Richard：</span><br>
My name's Bon Homme Richard, and this place is Samos Island.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Arkhangelsk：</span><br>
Curious pronunciation. Are you from Iris Libre or the Vichya Dominion?<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Bon Homme Richard：</span><br>
I get that a lot, but nope, I was born in the Eagle Union and work for the Federation.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Arkhangelsk：</span><br>
Oh, I see. And you said Samos just now? So we're in the Aegean Sea?<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Bon Homme Richard：</span><br>
Not exactly. We're in the seas of Bermuda.<br>
Sounds to me like you've lost your bearings. Did you sneak past the filter to play in the sun like me?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Arkhangelsk：</span><br>
That's one way of putting it.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Bon Homme Richard：</span><br>
Yeah, I getcha. Sneaking around's pretty fun.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Arkhangelsk：</span><br>
You're... not going to ask us to introduce ourselves?<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Bon Homme Richard：</span><br>
I mean, your uniforms make it pretty obvious you're from the Northern Parliament.<br>
Based on how disoriented you sound, I'll assume you suddenly found yourselves here with no clue how it happened.<br>
In other words, same as what happened to me!<br>
And I've got no reason to report you unless you do something totally unjustified. So just find a beach to lie down on and take it easy!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Arkhangelsk：</span><br>
"No clue how it happened?" Excuse me?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kronshtadt：</span><br>
(Psst. Let me take it from here.)<br>
Let's rewind a bit. You said, "That area's off-limits" earlier. Why?<br>
Is there more to this place than a tropical resort?<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Bon Homme Richard：</span><br>
THIS place is a tropical resort, yeah, but keep going that-a-way and you'll arrive at the Samos Marine Research Institute.<br>
You don't wanna go there. They had an accident a while ago which released ungodly beasties into the water. So I've heard, anyway.<br>
I don't know what really went down, but my advice is to steer clear of that place.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kronshtadt：</span><br>
Why hasn't anyone put up warning signs? One oblivious tourist is all it takes to cause a PR nightmare.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Bon Homme Richard：</span><br>
That's... a good question! Paradoxically though, tourism to this place has skyrocketed 'cause of that accident.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kronshtadt：</span><br>
All people hoping to snap a picture of an urban legend, I presume?<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Bon Homme Richard：</span><br>
Not all of them, but a large majority, yeah.<br>
Anyway, there's no issue as long as you don't go there. Stick to this area and you'll be fine.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kronshtadt：</span><br>
Thanks for the warning. One more question...<br>
You also said we "snuck past the filter," just like you, yes?<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Bon Homme Richard：</span><br>
Yup, it's just that I got here earlier than you. Speaking of which, I've actually gotta go soon.<br>
Professor's got me on a strict schedule, giving me the ol' "it's only temporary" consolation, but it's hard getting used to.<br>
Eh, forget it. Don't wanna ruin the wonderful weather with my grumbling!<br>
Before I go though, wanna take a group picture with me?<br>
Only natural to want to capture the moment in time you went to a beautiful place and made new friends, right?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Arkhangelsk：</span><br>
(A group picture...? What's the deal with this girl? How do we proceed?)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kronshtadt：</span><br>
(She'll distrust us if we refuse. Just go with it.)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Soobrazitelny：</span><br>
(Marvelous! I've been waiting for a chance to show off my genius mechanic look! ...Come on, smile for the camera, Kiev!)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kiev：</span><br>
(Like this? Hope this is fine...)<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Bon Homme Richard：</span><br>
Don't blink! 3, 2, 1!<br>
Say "cheese!"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Volga：</span><br>
Cheese!<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Bon Homme Richard：</span><br>
Niiice! And by the way, I won't be sharing this pic with anyone. It's just a little keepsake.<br>
Man, I'm running short on time... What are you girls gonna do? Stay and have another look around?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kronshtadt：</span><br>
Most likely. There's still more to see.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Bon Homme Richard：</span><br>
All right, have a good one~<br>
Just stay away from the exercise area, or you're going to have a bad time.<br>
If anyone asks, just say you got lost or suffered rigging malfunctions.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kronshtadt：</span><br>
Huh? What did you just say?<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Bon Homme Richard：</span><br>
Nothing! Just talking to myself! You guys would be nervous too if someone started asking you personal questions.<br>
Now it's time for me to go. Peace out~<br>
<br>
The girls bade farewell to Bon Homme Richard, who went back the way she came and disappeared into the wilderness.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Arkhangelsk：</span><br>
I clearly heard that girl say something about a rigging... Kronshtadt, do you think she's...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kronshtadt：</span><br>
A shipgirl, yes. From the Eagle Union, at that.<br>
...I shouldn't have let her take that picture. It could be used against us somehow...<br>
How sloppy of me, damnit...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Volga：</span><br>
W-well... Hindsight is 20/20, so don't be too hard on yourself. All we can do is hope she really won't report us.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Soobrazitelny：</span><br>
We haven't done anything totally unjustified in this place, so we'll have to take her word for it now that she's left!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kiev：</span><br>
Wait... She said she's FROM the Eagle Union but works for the Federation... What was that about?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Arkhangelsk：</span><br>
Who knows. More importantly, what should we investigate next? The marine institute, or that exercise area she mentioned?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kronshtadt：</span><br>
Good question. Both are potential leads, and we'll likely want to visit each anyway.<br>
What do you think, Soobrazitelny?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Soobrazitelny：</span><br>
My vote goes to the exercise area! That whole thing about monsters in the water sounds like a fabricated story to bring in tourists!<br>
If it wasn't made up, they would at the very least put fences to keep people out! There's not even a warning sign to be seen!<br>
So, I say we go to the exercise area where we can fully leverage our abilities!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kronshtadt：</span><br>
You have a point... Riggings were built for use on the open sea, not inside a building on land. Exercise area it is.<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Communicator：</span><br>
BEEP BEEP––!! BEEP BEEP––!!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Soobrazitelny：</span><br>
What the–? My communicator's going off!<br>
Who could be... This is odd. I've never seen this frequency or comms channel used before.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kiev：</span><br>
Mine's quiet though. Let me guess, you jailbroke your communicator?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Soobrazitelny：</span><br>
Isn't it obvious? What is a genius mechanic without a custom device? Ahh-ha-ha-haah!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kronshtadt：</span><br>
Answer it. Whoever's calling, they might give us some valuable intel.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Soobrazitelny：</span><br>
As you say!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Communicator：</span><br>
You are entering a Federation exercise area. State your name and affiliation at once!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Arkhangelsk：</span><br>
"Federation?" I think that's the organization Richard said she belongs to.<br>
I've got a hunch they have ties to the Eagle Union. They might even be the Eagle Union under a different name.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kronshtadt：</span><br>
That'll make this easier. Tell them the truth. If we're in luck, they might patch you through to the Commander and we can bypass Naval HQ.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Soobrazitelny：</span><br>
Right, I'll do just that!<br>
This is Northern Parliament destroyer Soobrazitelny and company! We hear you loud and clear!<br>
We weren't aware this was an exercise area – apologies! If you'll tell us the boundary of it, we'll change course right away!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Communicator：</span><br>
You're from the Northern Parliament?<br>
......<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Soobrazitelny：</span><br>
Huh. They hung up.<br>
As soon as I said we're from the Northern Parliament, too. Talk about rude.<br>
Or maybe they dropped their phone in awe when they realized it was me, the genius mechanic, they were talking to!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kiev：</span><br>
I don't think they've ever heard of you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Volga：</span><br>
Heads up! Several aircraft, 1 o'clock! They're headed straight for us!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kronshtadt：</span><br>
Shit! Volga, scramble your planes! Everyone, spread apart and enter diamond configuration!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Arkhangelsk：</span><br>
Why are they attacking us? Do they have us confused for their exercise opponent?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Soobrazitelny：</span><br>
After I literally just told them we're with the Northern Parliament? Highly unlikely!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kronshtadt：</span><br>
It has to be a misunderstanding. Otherwise why would they point their guns at people allied with the Azur Lane?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Soobrazitelny：</span><br>
I'll try to contact them again... Gah, I can't! The channel's been deactivated!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kronshtadt：</span><br>
Then we're in for a rough reception! Volga, give us aerial support!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Volga：</span><br>
Their planes are moving unbelievably fast, but I'll do my best!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kiev：</span><br>
The sky and the sea are... changing...!<br>
Look! What is that?!<br>
<br>
Kiev pointed up at the sky, obscured entirely by dark clouds when the weather had been clear just minutes ago.<br>
The distant air churned and formed a black tornado, kicking up raging streams as it plowed towards the girls at staggering speeds.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kronshtadt：</span><br>
A tornado too?! And those black waves...!<br>
<br>
The tornado's rapid formation sent a ripple across the sea, growing into a towering tsunami. Only moments later, they came crashing down on the girls.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kronshtadt：</span><br>
Everyone! Get behind me at–<br>
Urgh... Aghh...! AGH! So this is it...<br>
<br>
The crushing impact of the water sent Kronshtadt reeling. Not long after, she blacked out.<br>

FATAL ERROR.<br>
██████ PROGRESS: 22.8%<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">???：</span><br>
Kronshtadt! KRONSHTADT!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kronshtadt：</span><br>
Urgh...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">???：</span><br>
Phew... Thank god I was able to pull you out in time.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kronshtadt：</span><br>
*cough* *cough*... Ughh...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Arkhangelsk：</span><br>
What's wrong? You look like you just went through hell.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kronshtadt：</span><br>
Where... am I...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Arkhangelsk：</span><br>
Inside the Suliko's synchronization chamber. Do you need medical attention?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kronshtadt：</span><br>
Now I remember... I was... synchronizing...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Arkhangelsk：</span><br>
Goodness, the machine really did a number on you, both physically and mentally.<br>
I know we joked about vodka a second ago, but I think you've earned a shot.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kronshtadt：</span><br>
Like I said, it really was just a joke. Save the drinks for later.<br>
Anyway... What the hell was that?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Arkhangelsk：</span><br>
Hm? What the hell was what?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kronshtadt：</span><br>
The black tornado. Don't you remember?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Arkhangelsk：</span><br>
Black tornado? I really have no idea what you're talking about.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kronshtadt：</span><br>
Forget it then. Let me ask you a different question: have you heard of a technology that puts you in a lifelike dream with other people?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Arkhangelsk：</span><br>
Look, now's not the time for riddles. We're in the middle of a mission still.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kronshtadt：</span><br>
Yeah, I suppose... The synchronization process never even started, did it?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Arkhangelsk：</span><br>
No. It was about to, but I interrupted it immediately when you started tossing and turning in the chair.<br>
Are you sure you're all right? We can stop altogether if you feel sick.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kronshtadt：</span><br>
I'm fine, honestly. I just freaked out a bit. I'm ready to try again.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Soobrazitelny：</span><br>
Everything's good on our end, Kronshtadt! You can start the synchronization process now!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kronshtadt：</span><br>
Roger. Arkhangelsk, you ready to start again?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Arkhangelsk：</span><br>
Yup. Let me do one final check. Artifact is in place... Computer systems online... Data transfer port set to open...<br>
<br>
Kronshtadt put the headset on and waited in total darkness as Arkhangelsk worked in the background.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kronshtadt：</span><br>
Did I hallucinate all of that? It felt so real...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Arkhangelsk：</span><br>
All right. Initiating in 3... 2... 1... Now!<br>
<span style="color:#696969;">???：</span><br>
Don't blink! 3, 2, 1!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kronshtadt：</span><br>
Was that–?!<br>

<br>
Near the Research Base<br>
Several mass-produced icebreakers worked tirelessly to push through the thick ice, a small search fleet behind them.<br>
The fleet was lead by Sovetskaya Belorussiya, sister ship to Sovetsky Soyuz.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetskaya Belorussiya：</span><br>
We're approaching the coordinates of the distress signal sent from the research base.<br>
Had it not been for the heroism of Rossiya and the Commander, we wouldn't even have access to these waters.<br>
But, where could a submarine of that size be hiding...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Avrora：</span><br>
I've been looking around as well, but this is in fact where the signal came from.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetskaya Belorussiya：</span><br>
I really hope it's not coming from the bottom of the sea...<br>
<br>
Ice choked the horizon, spanning as far as the eye could see. As time passed, the participants in the search operation found it harder and harder even to make small talk.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tashkent：</span><br>
I've found the source of the signal!<br>
<br>
The signal led to the research base, an imposing structure rebuilt from a Siren facility. It was here that the "rescue signal" – and the location of the meteorite, would be traced once more.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetskaya Belorussiya：</span><br>
So this is the research base that Soyuz had been telling me about. It looks even more impressive than I had imagined.<br>
I was convinced that she was exaggerating when describing it. Turns out, she had not even done it justice.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Avrora：</span><br>
There's nothing left in the research base.<br>
This place has been completely covered in snow and ice through the passage of time...<br>
.........<br>
I'm sorry... Kronshtadt, Arkhangelsk, Soobrazitelny, Kiev, and Volga...<br>
I couldn't do anything for you back then...<br>
But please hang in there... We're coming to bring you home...!<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=Holiday Getaway II|选项=17|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<br>
Kronshtadt's mind floated through a pure white void.<br>
Moments ago she lay in an uncomfortable chair inside a dreary room. Now it was as though she'd left her own body and soared through the sky.<br>
The experience felt a lot like downing an entire barrel of vodka then getting carted through a desert of snow and ice.<br>
All of a sudden, she was blasted with countless packets of data. Images coalesced into a pixelated mess and overlapping voices became indiscernible from static noise.<br>
How long was she exposed to that storm of information? Seconds? Hours? There's no telling.<br>
But throughout it all, she clung on to her consciousness, lest the storm engulf her. Soon she could feel her own two feet touch the ground.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kronshtadt：</span><br>
Ugghh... Why do I have the mother of all hangovers when I've not had a drop to drink...<br>
Getting drunk is the fun part, and I've skipped straight to the horrible day after part...<br>
(Wait a second... I've felt this exact thing before!)<br>
(This is no straightforward case of deja vu... I can still remember it all so vividly.)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Arkhangelsk：</span><br>
Kronshtadt?! H-how did this happen?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kronshtadt：</span><br>
(There's Arkhangelsk, saying the exact same thing as before...)<br>
(Either she's just as surprised as last time, or I'm reliving the same dream only I can see...)<br>
(Let's play along for now and see what happens.)<br>
That's my line! I'm the one who was in the synchronization chair!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Arkhangelsk：</span><br>
Yeah, it makes no sense... The machine started whirring, and the next thing I know, I'm here.<br>
And we're not the only ones. Look! Soobrazitelny, Kiev, and Volga all wound up here too!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Volga：</span><br>
Mrmhh... Whuh– Where are we....?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kronshtadt：</span><br>
Based on the climate and ocean currents, it seems we've wound up in the SA Ocean – somewhere near Bermuda.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Arkhangelsk：</span><br>
What? Did you just figure that out in less than a minute? Because wow.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kronshtadt：</span><br>
Please. Being able to make accurate deductions based on your surroundings is a required skill in my line of work.<br>
(If Soobrazitelny was right, that means I'm the only dreamer here. That makes my objective finding out why I'm having this particular dream.)<br>
(I need more info. Who is Richard really? What is that exercise area? How did that black tornado form?)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Soobrazitelny：</span><br>
I've figured it out! This is all a dream! A dream where we're in a holiday resort somewhere!<br>
Kiev, pinch my cheek as hard as you can!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kronshtadt：</span><br>
No, don't. Let her do that and it'll be sore for days.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Soobrazitelny：</span><br>
Days?! Never mind then, and thank you Kronshtadt! ...Also, aren't you a little too calm, given the nonsensical circumstances?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kiev：</span><br>
I'm fine with calm. I feel safe with a calm leader.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Soobrazitelny：</span><br>
But how?! Even I lost my cool a minute ago, and I'm the most composed genius mechanic on the planet!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kronshtadt：</span><br>
(It's not so hard when you've been through it once. Let's skip ahead a bit...)<br>
Seems we were teleported here somehow. Volga, can you launch some recon planes?<br>
There should be an island off in that direction. See if you can find it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Volga：</span><br>
Okey-dokey. Give me just one minute...<br>
...Wow, you're right! There IS an island there!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kronshtadt：</span><br>
(Same place as last time. Safe to say the environment is fixed, then.)<br>
Well, since the briefing simply said to gather data, that island is a good place to start.<br>
My gut tells me it's connected to the meteorite somehow. Let's see if I'm right.<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=Reunion with Richard|选项=18|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<br>
Over on the island, the girls followed the tourist road until they came across a place with a thicket.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kronshtadt：</span><br>
If memory serves me right, it's just up ahead...<br>
Now she should pop out after we turn this right corner...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Arkhangelsk：</span><br>
Who? How do you know someone else is here?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kronshtadt：</span><br>
(Crap! Spoke my thoughts out loud!)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Arkhangelsk：</span><br>
You're scaring Volga – she says something's felt wrong about you since shortly after we got here.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kronshtadt：</span><br>
Really now? What makes her think that?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Arkhangelsk：</span><br>
I dunno. Kiev and Soobrazitelny haven't said anything, and I didn't notice it either until Volga pointed it out.<br>
But, Volga's intuition tends to be really good when it comes to people's emotions. That's why I wanted to check on you.<br>
The fact that you're so calm and decisive in this strange situation... I'm not sure whether it's totally in character or totally out of character for you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kronshtadt：</span><br>
...I'm not sure what to make of that.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Arkhangelsk：</span><br>
See, our intelligence personnel are trained to handle unknown situations, but that's not you, right?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kronshtadt：</span><br>
That doesn't sound like a compliment to me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Arkhangelsk：</span><br>
In other words, I'm the one who should be saying, I'm not sure what to make of your behavior.<br>
You've been acting weird from the moment you sat down in that chair.<br>
Don't you think you can open up to us? Your friends are getting worried.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kronshtadt：</span><br>
I... I'm sorry, but I still haven't sorted things through in my own head yet.<br>
Just give me a bit more time...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Arkhangelsk：</span><br>
All right. I'm not going to push you for answers, but we're in this together.<br>
<span style="color:#696969;">???：</span><br>
Hey, you there! That area's off-limits!<br>
<br>
The conversation between Kronshtadt and Arkhangelsk was suddenly interrupted by a young girl's voice.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kronshtadt：</span><br>
(Right on schedule.)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kiev：</span><br>
Back off!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kronshtadt：</span><br>
Stand down, Kiev. I'll handle this.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kiev：</span><br>
...You sure that's a good idea?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kronshtadt：</span><br>
Just do as I say. Now... Bon Homme Richard, I presume? I hope we didn't frighten you.<br>
<span style="color:#696969;">？？？：</span><br>
Nah, it's all good. My bad for calling out to you out of nowhere.<br>
You know my name, huh? This is the last place I expected to run into one of my fans!<br>
<br>
The stranger emerged from a roadside thicket, revealing herself. She was dressed much differently to them.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kronshtadt：</span><br>
What are you be doing all the way out here? Is there something going on in that exercise area up ahead? Oh, and do you mind if I just call you Richard?<br>
<span style="color:#696969;">Bon Homme Richard：</span><br>
Woah, that's a lot of questions out of the blue... Say, are you girls spies from the Northern Parliament?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Soobrazitelny：</span><br>
No, we're not! At least I'm no spy - there's no room for other stuff in the brain of a genius mechanic!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kiev：</span><br>
.........<br>
<span style="color:#696969;">Bon Homme Richard：</span><br>
Haha, I was just cracking a joke. Nobody would hire a bunch of oddballs like you to be spies!<br>
Sorry about that. It's just, those questions you asked me earlier came off a bit suspicious, you know?<br>
Normally when you meet someone, you don't just go right into "what are you doing here," right?<br>
But since you're interested, why don't we play a little game and have you guess what I'm doing here~♪<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kronshtadt：</span><br>
Hmm... How about, you snuck past the filter to have some fun in the sun? How does that sound?<br>
<span style="color:#696969;">Bon Homme Richard：</span><br>
Woow, you really got it right on the first try!<br>
Bingo, bingo! I snuck away and came to visit this island!<br>
But, I can't stay out too long or people will get antsy.<br>
As for this exercise area... It's funny to me that you even know what it is.<br>
You know what's really odd? That the Federation and the Revolutionary Front – both at odds with each other – are conducting huge exercises here. Same place, same time.<br>
Oh, but I'm sure there are a bunch of other strong ships here! Are you going to participate as well?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kronshtadt：</span><br>
I'm afraid not. We're just here as tourists.<br>
(This is new... She mentioned the Federation before, but what is this "Revolutionary Front" organization?)<br>
<span style="color:#696969;">Bon Homme Richard：</span><br>
Before I go though, wanna take a group picture with me?<br>
Only natural to want to capture the moment in time you went to a beautiful place and made new friends, right?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Arkhangelsk：</span><br>
(A group picture...? What's the deal with this girl? How do we proceed?)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kronshtadt：</span><br>
I don't mind. Sounds like a good idea to me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Soobrazitelny：</span><br>
(Marvelous! I've been waiting for a chance to show off my genius mechanic look! ...Come on, smile for the camera, Kiev!)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kiev：</span><br>
(Like this? Hope this is fine...)<br>
<span style="color:#696969;">Bon Homme Richard：</span><br>
Don't blink! 3, 2, 1!<br>
Say "cheese"!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Volga：</span><br>
Cheese!<br>
<span style="color:#696969;">Bon Homme Richard：</span><br>
Man, I'm running short on time... What are you girls gonna do? Stay and have another look around?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kronshtadt：</span><br>
Most likely. There's still more to see.<br>
<span style="color:#696969;">Bon Homme Richard：</span><br>
Fair enough. Don't you think it's boring just chilling on this island though?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kronshtadt：</span><br>
...Hm?<br>
<span style="color:#696969;">Bon Homme Richard：</span><br>
You're still curious about that exercise area, aren't you? Ehehe. If you want to see for yourself what true "power" looks like––<br>
Why don't you head down there yourselves? Hehe~♪<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kronshtadt：</span><br>
(What the hell is going on?! She's acting like a completely different person than before...)<br>
Are you sure you're fine with that? Your "Federation" isn't going to find people like us suspicious?<br>
<span style="color:#696969;">Bon Homme Richard：</span><br>
Why? There's nothing wrong with girls who want "power."<br>
Now it's time for me to go. Peace out~<br>
<br>
The girls bade farewell to Bon Homme Richard, who went back the way she came and disappeared into the wilderness.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Arkhangelsk：</span><br>
What a weird girl. Someone you know, Kronshtadt?<br>
There are too many things to keep track of that I've never heard of before. What is this "Federation," and what's the deal with this exercise area?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kronshtadt：</span><br>
(But what I'm more curious about... is why none of you seem to know anything.)<br>
Sorry, but I've been totally lost since the moment I got here.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Arkhangelsk：</span><br>
Sigh... You really are a true professional, Kronshtadt.<br>
So, what do we check out next? Want to head down to the exercise area like that girl said?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kronshtadt：</span><br>
The way she was talking about power in quotes was giving me the chills.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Soobrazitelny：</span><br>
But did you see the smartphone she had on her? It looked insanely advanced!<br>
Mechanical marvels are the only power that this genius mechanic needs! Let's stay away from that exercise area.<br>
Or so I'd like to say, but if they really do have some ridiculous power, we should at least find out what it is.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kiev：</span><br>
I also want to see it for myself...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Volga：</span><br>
What are those two "at odds with each other" organizations she mentioned? I'm not sure they'd appreciate outsiders intruding into their exercise...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kronshtadt：</span><br>
We'll have to move forward really carefully and avoid stepping on any toes then. Arkhangelsk, Volga, can we count on you two for the reconnaissance again?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Arkhangelsk：</span><br>
Sure thing. Ready whenever you are.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kronshtadt：</span><br>
Let's make good use of our time. Get going, everyone!<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=No Response|选项=19|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<br>
Tracing a course plotted by Kronshtadt, the girls advanced towards the exercise area located in the seas of Bermuda.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kronshtadt：</span><br>
Soobrazitelny, has your communicator gone off in the past few minutes?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Soobrazitelny：</span><br>
Nope! Not a single peep across any channels!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kronshtadt：</span><br>
Good. That means we're making progress.<br>
(Just going around the Federation's exercise area seems to be working. If all goes well, we'll be safe once we contact an Eagle Union fleet in the region.)<br>
(I believe their closest base is situated on the east coast...)<br>
<br>
After letting Soobrazitelny fine-tune her communicator, Kronshtadt contacted the Eagle Union base through a private channel.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Communicator：</span><br>
......<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kronshtadt：</span><br>
(No response?! I'll try their SA base instead...)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Communicator：</span><br>
......<br>
<br>
She tried again and again with many different channels, but not a single one answered her calls.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kronshtadt：</span><br>
(How is this possible? Is this not Eagle Union territory? Richard did say she's from the Eagle Union though, and all these tourists look to be as well...)<br>
(I suppose this dream might be an alternate reality where the Eagle Union controls much less territory than it does in the real world.)<br>
(That leaves us with little choice but to try with that "Revolutionary Front" faction... Hopefully they'll receive us more kindly than Federation did.)<br>

{{折叠面板|标题=Washed Away II|选项=20|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Communicator：</span><br>
BEEP BEEP––!! BEEP BEEP––!!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Soobrazitelny：</span><br>
What the–? My communicator's going off!<br>
Who could be... This is odd. I've never seen this frequency or comms channel used before.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kiev：</span><br>
Mine's quiet though. Let me guess, you jailbroke your communicator?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Soobrazitelny：</span><br>
Isn't it obvious? What is a genius mechanic without a custom device? Ahh-ha-ha-haah!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kronshtadt：</span><br>
(What?! But we're well beyond the Federation's exercise area boundary! Who's calling us?)<br>
(They'll light us up if we identify as belonging to the Northern Parliament... The best move here is to just ignore the call.)<br>
(Ugh. Working covertly is so not my style, despite me being a spy...)<br>
Ignore it. Close the comms channel and circle around to the other side of the sector.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Soobrazitelny：</span><br>
Roger that!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Volga：</span><br>
Heads up! Mass-produced ships incoming, straight ahead!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Soobrazitelny：</span><br>
Are they Sirens?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Volga：</span><br>
No. They're most similar to Northern Parliament ships, but they don't look right...<br>
They've got camouflage and profiles unlike any I've seen before. I'm not sure they're on our side!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Soobrazitelny：</span><br>
Then they probably aren't! They must belong to either the Federation or the Revolutionary Front!<br>
I want to get a closer look at them! Kronshtadt, permission to advance!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kiev：</span><br>
Bad idea. What would you do if a potentially dangerous shipgirl approached you without warning?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Soobrazitelny：</span><br>
Good point! I'll give them a heads-up through my communicator then!<br>
That said, it does feel pretty strange to contact them now after we ghosted them just earlier!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kronshtadt：</span><br>
(Dammit, so we have to answer someone's call in the end... Is there no way to travel through here without getting into trouble?)<br>
<br>
While the girls debated how to contact the Revolutionary Front, the sector the mass-produced ships came from underwent a drastic transformation.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kiev：</span><br>
The sky and the sea are... changing...!<br>
Look! What is that?!<br>
<br>
Kiev pointed up at the sky, obscured entirely by dark clouds when the weather had been clear just minutes ago.<br>
As though the mass-produced ships too were bewildered by the unexpected abnormal weather, they abruptly broke formation and changed targets.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Volga：</span><br>
They're firing their cannons – but not at us! They're shooting into the clouds!<br>
<br>
They cycled through their volleys, launching barrage after barrage into something concealed within a black tsunami, growing in size over the horizon.<br>
Explosions boomed, gunfire flared, and smoke rose – after which a storm began taking shape from the black seas, a chaotic mass clawing at the sky.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kronshtadt：</span><br>
(It's happening all over again... There's the black tornado!)<br>
<br>
The distant air churned and formed a black tornado, kicking up raging streams as it plowed towards the girls at staggering speeds.<br>
Far faster than the streams were the waves generated by the tornado's formation. They would come down on the girls in just moments from now.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kronshtadt：</span><br>
Brace for impact! Destroyers, get behind us bigger ships! Volga, Arkhangelsk, hurry!<br>
(I'm not letting them wipe us out a second time!)<br>
(I WILL persist, find out who's creating this black tornado, burn their identity into my memory, and learn the truth behind this dream if it's the last thing I do!)<br>
<br>
The relentless black waves whipped Kronshtadt's entire body, each impact stronger than the last, pushing her stamina to its limits.<br>
Each hit bore down on her like a sub-zero slash and burned like the flame of a blowtorch, wearing away at her rigging, her body, and her spirit bit by bit.<br>
Her consciousness began to slip. The hard truth dawned on her – there was no overcoming the black tornado and the destructive waves it sent forth.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kronshtadt：</span><br>
Argh! The pain is unbearable... Even worse than the last time...!<br>
But... my persistence... paid off! I now know... who's creating the tornado...!<br>
<br>
The mass-produced ships that dotted the horizon had been completely obliterated, leaving only a roaring maelstrom sitting atop a throne of shattered hulls.<br>
Water, flames, hulls, and smoke – nothing was spared from its ravenous maw. Its destructive energy poured out endlessly in all directions.<br>
When Kronshtadt turned her eyes to the center of the maelstrom, it was then that she came face-to-face with "her."<br>
Though the figure seemed so small in comparison to the swirling chaos, there was nothing weak about her appearance. From the storm seemed to echo familiar laughter.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kronshtadt：</span><br>
You... You're the one responsible for this...!<br>
<br>
Kronshtadt etched that thought into her mind just before her consciousness was once again wrenched away from her.<br>

<br>
FATAL ERROR.<br>
██████ PROGRESS: 37.1%<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">???：</span><br>
Kronshtadt? Kronshtadt! Are you all right?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kronshtadt：</span><br>
......<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">???：</span><br>
Thank god... You're finally awake.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kronshtadt：</span><br>
Urgh......<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Arkhangelsk：</span><br>
How are you feeling? Any pains, aches, or nausea?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kronshtadt：</span><br>
(I'm back in the synchronization chamber... Must mean the black tornado got me again.)<br>
<br>
Everything from the dream was gone. The mass-produced ships, the tornado, and the being who created the storm.<br>
Gone, like they were never real to begin with.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kronshtadt：</span><br>
Arkhangelsk, let's put the synchronization on hold for a bit.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Arkhangelsk：</span><br>
Look how pale you are! I knew this was a bad idea. One moment you're fine, the next you're squirming like you're having a waking nightmare.<br>
Sigh... Sorry. I should've given you vodka when you first requested it.<br>
I'll get you a glass. Wait right here.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kronshtadt：</span><br>
Would you please forget about the goddamn vodka?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Arkhangelsk：</span><br>
Shh, don't talk, just get some rest. I'll tell Soobrazitelny we're taking a break.<br>
You might FEEL fine, but you're not fit for this mission without a sound mind. And you, my friend, are not sound of mind right now.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kronshtadt：</span><br>
(This confirms it – I'm the only dreamer between us five. No wonder Arkhangelsk has no idea what's really going on here.)<br>
(Huh...? Her hands are shaking...)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Arkhangelsk：</span><br>
Why are you staring a hole through me? Is something wrong?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kronshtadt：</span><br>
(No, I was too quick to judge. She also experienced what happened in the dream too, she simply doesn't remember it.)<br>
(I'm getting weaker with each time the tornado consumes me. The other four must be feeling it too...)<br>
(This machine is extremely dangerous. We'll all die if I keep using it. No, what we need to do is return to the base immediately.)<br>
(But... how? Without weapons, we're just as dead if we encounter any Sirens on the way. Plus, the meteorite has to stay here...)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Arkhangelsk：</span><br>
Kronshtadt? Kronshtadt, listen to me. It's important.<br>
This isn't your fight alone. Your friends are right here with you, and we'll always listen when you have something on your mind.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kronshtadt：</span><br>
(She's right. Try as I might, I can't do this on my own. I need some time away from this claustrophobia-inducing room.)<br>
Sorry, I need to get some fresh air. Fresher than what's in this chamber, at least.<br>
<br>
Suliko Interior - Bridge<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kronshtadt：</span><br>
(We are in some deep shit here. Things aren't looking good.)<br>
(Analyzing the meteorite is sapping our strength. Running away runs the risk of encountering Sirens. Even if we get away, we'll never get this golden opportunity again.)<br>
(If this is a side-effect of the connection, then there's no way Soyuz could've foreseen its effects...)<br>
(Heh... Looks like I really jinxed us trying to be a blowhard back then...)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
Now, I'd like to reiterate – we likely won't get another opportunity like this.<br>
The Northern Parliament's future rests on your shoulders, everyone. Bear that in mind all throughout this mission.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kronshtadt：</span><br>
Good thing this is exactly the kind of mission I've been looking forward to.<br>
(Cursing myself won't do us any good. I need to come up with a plan. Think, Kronshtadt, think...)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Soobrazitelny：</span><br>
There you are, Kronshtadt! I took the liberty of locking the grappling arms in position so I don't need to babysit the controls.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kronshtadt：</span><br>
If it isn't our genius captain. How are things?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Soobrazitelny：</span><br>
Pretty good! Working a submarine is a walk in the park when you're a genius mechanic!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kronshtadt：</span><br>
I'll bet. Where are Kiev and Volga?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Soobrazitelny：</span><br>
You're sitting right next to them. Don't tell me the machine messed with your head?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kiev：</span><br>
Kronshtadt...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kronshtadt：</span><br>
...Oops, sorry. I guess I'm a little out of it right now.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Volga：</span><br>
A little? With how ill you look, it's a miracle you can still walk.<br>
If you need someone to synchronize in your place, I'm willing to do it.<br>
But if you insist on doing it yourself, please pace yourself. There's no need to rush when the Sirens are still unaware of us.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kronshtadt：</span><br>
You know what... I'll take your advice and take a little break.<br>
But nobody besides me will synchronize. Soyuz entrusted this mission to me, and I won't let her down.<br>
(Besides, poor Volga would be mentally scarred for life if she felt what it's like to be swallowed by that black tsunami.)<br>
I do appreciate the concern, but I can handle myself. You worry too much, Volga.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Volga：</span><br>
Do I? Maybe you're right. I've wondered a few times if I'm making myself useful enough, and feared the mission might not be going as planned...<br>
That's just me being me though. With the meteorite in our possession, we only need to extract all the data we can, then we'll be home free.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Soobrazitelny：</span><br>
We're not home free until we're home, period! Making it back safely is part of the mission!<br>
Personally, I've been enjoying every minute on this submarine! I'm having too much fun to let doubts cloud my mind!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kiev：</span><br>
Me, I wish I was fighting Sirens right now. Studying rocks is boring.<br>
Having said that... I'd rather be here with my friends than out fighting alone.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Soobrazitelny：</span><br>
Incidentally, Kronshtadt, I wanted to ask this earlier but you were busy: could we stop by the research base for a while longer when we go back?<br>
I know it has no tech left to salvage, but there's no shortage of machines I'd love to tinker with!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kronshtadt：</span><br>
Urgh......<br>
Sure, sure. I'll mention your request to Soyuz later.<br>
Keep in mind though that the biggest toll this mission takes is on our minds. If you don't want to be left alone without proper utilities, you might want to reconsider.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Soobrazitelny：</span><br>
I wouldn't want to be all alone! Let me bring Kiev with me!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kiev：</span><br>
...No way, no how. I've got combat training to do, and I'd hate to neglect it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Soobrazitelny：</span><br>
You can still do that! You said a minute ago you'd rather fight with friends on your side, remember?<br>
Sirens already appeared on the way here, and I'll bet more will show up at the base eventually!<br>
It's the best of both worlds! You and I can hang out and fight together!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kiev：</span><br>
That's... actually a good point.<br>
On second thought, I'm fine with that. Kronshtadt, you can put me on base guard duty after the mission.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kronshtadt：</span><br>
No promises, but I'll see what I can do.<br>
All right, I think I've rested for long enough. Wouldn't want to keep Arkhangelsk waiting all day.<br>
(Thank you all – for helping me regain my sanity.)<br>
Arkhangelsk! Are you good to go?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Arkhangelsk：</span><br>
Yes, and you don't need to shout. Any louder and the Sirens would've probably heard it.<br>
Jokes aside, hearing you shout is a good sign – means you've regained your strength. Ready to give synchronization another shot?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kronshtadt：</span><br>
Of course. I can't lounge around too long or I get restless.<br>
Let's do this. Take me to dreamland once more.<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=Holiday Getaway III|选项=22|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<br>
After being blinded by a bright white light, the girls awaken once again, having been transported to the seas of Bermuda.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kronshtadt：</span><br>
(Starting point is the same as last time. Good.)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Arkhangelsk：</span><br>
Kronshtadt?! H-how did this happen?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Volga：</span><br>
Huh...? How'd I get here? I was on the bridge just a moment ago...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Soobrazitelny：</span><br>
What is happening here?! Did I doze off and start dreaming?! Kiev, come here and pinch my cheek!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kiev：</span><br>
Oh no... I don't like this one bit...<br>
<br>
Those same clear blue skies. The warm sunshine. The tranquil sound of the sea. This place was seemingly the idyllic holiday resort.<br>
And in less than a few hours, all of it would be engulfed by that horrific black tsunami.<br>
That is, unless someone put a stop to it first.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kronshtadt：</span><br>
(After all this, it's time to let them in on the truth.)<br>
Everyone calm down and listen. This is now our third time in this place. Let me explain...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Soobrazitelny：</span><br>
You have got to be kidding me! Your story has too many holes in it! It's simply not possible!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Volga：</span><br>
That's a bit too farfetched even for me to believe, I'm afraid...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Arkhangelsk：</span><br>
It's impressively elaborate for a story you made up to ease our minds, I'll give you that much.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kronshtadt：</span><br>
It's not, Arkhangelsk. I swear on my honor and reputation that it's the truth. You have to believe me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Arkhangelsk：</span><br>
Well... You are the leader, and I don't think you'd lie to us.<br>
Assuming you're telling us the truth, that still leaves some unanswered questions.<br>
You said on the first visit we were engulfed by a black tsunami, interrupting the synchronization process and sending us back to the Suliko.<br>
Then the second visit, the tsunami got us again and the synchronization process was interrupted.<br>
And now it's our third visit, and yet you're the only one with any recollection of what happened. Why?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Soobrazitelny：</span><br>
Hmm... Wait, I know! The answer has been right under our noses!<br>
It's the headset! Only Kronshtadt has worn it, right?<br>
It must somehow let her retain her memories of what happened in this place! Without it, you forget it all!<br>
Now, that doesn't explain why the rest of us get dragged into the dream as well, but my hypothesis is that the machine "hooks on" to the mind of anyone within range and drags them in!<br>
Then when it disconnects, it takes your memory of the dream with it, but the headset, dare I say, synchronizes your real and dream memories!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kronshtadt：</span><br>
It's a stretch, but it does connect the dots.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Volga：</span><br>
Even if we forget everything that happens in here, we'll always trust you.<br>
Just explain it like you did just now, and we'll believe you no matter how many loops we forget!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kiev：</span><br>
Yeah... It'll be fine.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kronshtadt：</span><br>
Thank you all for believing me. I'll explain it all as many times as needed, but let's try to finish the mission on this loop.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Arkhangelsk：</span><br>
You know, now that I'm aware this is all a dream, suddenly I can't help but feel creeped out by this place.<br>
After processing your explanation a little, some things you mentioned stood out to me.<br>
You said during the first and second visits, that Richard girl looked different, but everything else was the same.<br>
That, to me, suggests she plays a pivotal role in this dream. Hell, her appearance might continue changing.<br>
Then there's that black tornado – and tsunami – that sends us back to the Suliko when it gets us. That's the failure condition, right?<br>
What we should do then is pursue options that extend the dream for as long as possible while we gather new information.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kiev：</span><br>
Easy. We travel away from the exercise area and explore some other place.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Arkhangelsk：</span><br>
Good idea! And if that Richard girl appears, we should just avoid her altogether. I don't trust her.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Soobrazitelny：</span><br>
I'm in favor of a change of pace from the last loops and traveling the opposite direction! We aren't far from the Eagle Union's east coast!<br>
If we get far enough away from the exercise area, the black tsunami won't reach us even if it does manifest!<br>
Plus, we can observe it from a safe distance and gather data! What do you say?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kronshtadt：</span><br>
You make a good case... Let's do it. Third time's the charm.<br>
Once the waves have subsided, we can take our sweet time exploring this place.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Soobrazitelny：</span><br>
Ahh-ha-ha-haah! A genius always makes genius suggestions! Now, let us set off!<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=Off Script|选项=23|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<br>
Taking a different approach to the last two loops, this time the girls sailed away from the exercise area and towards the Eagle Union's east coast.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kronshtadt：</span><br>
...Should happen any minute now.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Arkhangelsk：</span><br>
What should?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kronshtadt：</span><br>
I kept an eye on the clock since we arrived, and it's around this time the black tsunami appears.<br>
Had we done the same as before, it'd be rushing towards us right now.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Volga：</span><br>
But we're not seeing one, soooo... does that mean we did it? Did we get around the tsunami?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Soobrazitelny：</span><br>
Hell yes! My plan worked!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kronshtadt：</span><br>
Don't pop the champagne just yet. That tornado and subsequent tsunami are so massive they can be seen for miles and miles.<br>
So if they do form despite us being nowhere near, we'll see it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Arkhangelsk：</span><br>
Uhh, yeah, about that... It's getting pretty foggy pretty fast out here, isn't it?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kiev：</span><br>
So foggy... it's hard to see anything.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Soobrazitelny：</span><br>
*inhale*... *exhale*... *inhale*...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kiev：</span><br>
What are you doing?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Soobrazitelny：</span><br>
Practicing my breaststroke, just in case the tsunami reaches us!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kiev：</span><br>
...You won't swim your way through a tsunami, you know.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Soobrazitelny：</span><br>
It's a joke, you're supposed to laugh! If Kronshtadt couldn't withstand that monster of a wave, I'm as screwed as a nut on a rocket hull!<br>
On a serious note, this fog is getting thicker at an alarming rate. The horizon was clearly visible just a minute ago...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kronshtadt：</span><br>
This is abnormal even for the Bermuda Sea. Someone has to be manipulating the weather.<br>
For all we know, there could be Mirror Seas even in this dream world. Be on your guard, everyone.<br>
Volga, can you see anything from above?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Volga：</span><br>
Sadly not... It's like the whole sea became covered in a layer of fog.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kronshtadt：</span><br>
It'll be impossible to stay oriented like this...<br>
<span style="color:#696969;">???：</span><br>
Hey, you there! This area's off-limits!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Soobrazitelny：</span><br>
Eek! Wh-wh-who the hell are you?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kiev：</span><br>
Back off!<br>
<br>
A girl outfitted with ship rigging suddenly emerged from the fog, right in front of the Northern Parliament girls.<br>
Kiev responded immediately with a volley. The girl dodged and circled behind Soobrazitelny, who was still reeling from shock.<br>
She melted into the fog again before making the same entrance, suddenly appearing right before Kronshtadt.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kronshtadt：</span><br>
Richard...?<br>
<span style="color:#696969;">Bon Homme Richard：</span><br>
Yup, that's me!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kronshtadt：</span><br>
Lower your weapons, everyone! Do not attack her!<br>
<br>
Kronshtadt ordered her comrades to stand down before walking with a brave stride towards the girl only known as Bon Homme Richard.<br>
<span style="color:#696969;">Bon Homme Richard：</span><br>
Come on, lady. Is this any way to greet someone?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kronshtadt：</span><br>
Why are you here?<br>
<span style="color:#696969;">Bon Homme Richard：</span><br>
Hey, that's what I'm wondering. Why are YOU people here?<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=Washed Away III|选项=24|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<br>
The outline of Bon Homme Richard was clearly visible even through the fog.<br>
Though she was equipped with her rigging, she showed no signs of hostility, her demeanor disarming as always.<br>
However, Kronshtadt viscerally felt something terrifying hidden beneath that smile.<br>
The reason was that...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kronshtadt：</span><br>
You're not the Richard I know. She didn't look like this.<br>
Answer me: Who are you really?<br>
<span style="color:#696969;">Bon Homme Richard：</span><br>
You're a strange one, lady. You just called my name, didn't you?<br>
Bon Homme Richard.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kronshtadt：</span><br>
What...?! But how...<br>
<span style="color:#696969;">Bon Homme Richard：</span><br>
Hmm?<br>
<br>
In Kronshtadt's head, the image of the girl standing before her shifted rapidly between the one she knew before, and the current one.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kronshtadt：</span><br>
Arkhangelsk! Describe how this girl looks to you, right now!<br>
Her hair color, eye color, and the length of her hair!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Arkhangelsk：</span><br>
White, blue, and semi-long, respectively!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Soobrazitelny：</span><br>
I'm seeing the same thing! Why, are you seeing something different?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kronshtadt：</span><br>
What's going on? Why am I the only person seeing something different?!<br>
But this world is my... My...<br>
Answer me! Who the hell are you? And how are you messing with my mind?<br>
<span style="color:#696969;">Bon Homme Richard：</span><br>
You're looking at the real Bon Homme Richard, lady.<br>
Actually... Heheheh, I'm more curious about how I appear to you through your eyes.<br>
<br>
Richard continued to chuckle bemusedly, a sense of fear awakening within Kronshtadt.<br>
She wracked her brain, sifting through her memories... Following the trails left behind through the dreams to anything pertaining to the person in front of her.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kronshtadt：</span><br>
Right... That photo! We took a photo!<br>
But... we didn't meet this time, so there wouldn't be a photo...<br>
<span style="color:#696969;">Bon Homme Richard：</span><br>
Oh, are you talking about that photo? I have it right here~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kronshtadt：</span><br>
What...?<br>
<br>
Kronshtadt looked at the photo Richard held in her hand.<br>
Despite the familiar, friendly setting of the photo, the girl's inhuman red eyes gazed back at her with a gleeful emptiness.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kronshtadt：</span><br>
This isn't what happened before... I'm sure of it...<br>
<br>
She tried to stay calm, sorting through all the possibilities in her head. For someone so used to controlling all sorts of information, the inexplicable and illogical drove the seeds of fear deeper into her heart.<br>
<span style="color:#696969;">Bon Homme Richard：</span><br>
Are you okay, lady? You don't look so good~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kronshtadt：</span><br>
(My comrades aren't noticing anything strange about Richard. I need to compose myself and get information out of her...)<br>
I'm fine. Can you tell me about the restricted area up ahead?<br>
<span style="color:#696969;">Bon Homme Richard：</span><br>
Hm? Are you talking about this exercise area?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kronshtadt：</span><br>
Exercise area? I thought we were heading in the opposite direction!<br>
<span style="color:#696969;">Bon Homme Richard：</span><br>
Ahaha, what are you talking about? This entire place is the exercise area! You wouldn't want to miss our exciting wargame, would you?<br>
Well, not that you'd be able to anyway~<br>
Look, it's about to start right now! Hehehe... Ahahahaha!<br>
<br>
Suddenly, Richard's ordinarily amicable voice turned grating and maniacal.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kronshtadt：</span><br>
I still don't know who you are or what you're after...<br>
But if you intend to block our way, then we will show you no mercy!<br>
<span style="color:#696969;">Bon Homme Richard：</span><br>
Don't be so trigger-happy, lady. Hold it in a bit longer – there's plenty of fun to be had~♪<br>
<br>
Though Kronshtadt already stood poised to start shooting, Richard continued to ramble mirthfully, as relaxed and carefree as ever.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kronshtadt：</span><br>
(What's with this girl...? I feel as if I'm being watched... by thousands of people, not just this one girl...)<br>
(Whatever she is, she's dangerous! And at this rate, we're going to become her prey!)<br>
(We need to get out of here, fast... But how? Think, think!)<br>
(That's it, that's the only answer. We have to defeat her. We have to defeat her and get out of here as quickly as possible!!)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Volga：</span><br>
Huh? Kronshtadt, what are you doing?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kronshtadt：</span><br>
Everyone, fire! Unload everything you have into that girl!<br>
<br>
KABOOOM!<br>
Kronstadt's main gun roared to life before she even finished her command.<br>
Following her lead, the other members of her fleet started to unload into Richard as well.<br>
...But, their attacks seemed to pass right through her body, incapable of leaving even a dent.<br>
<span style="color:#696969;">Bon Homme Richard：</span><br>
Time's up~♪<br>
Heheh... Hehehe... Ahahaha! Ahhahahahahahahaha!<br>
It's starting! Yes, yeeees! It's starting again! Ahahahahaha!<br>
<br>
The girl's cacophonous laughter seemed to split through the fog covering the area in the blink of an eye.<br>
Under a sky darkened by black clouds, countless mass-produced ships stood lined up, preparing to face each other.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kronshtadt：</span><br>
What? Where'd all those ships come from?!<br>
<span style="color:#696969;">Bon Homme Richard：</span><br>
C'mon, lady, let's have lots and lots of fun!<br>
<br>
The girl spread her arms wide, pitch-black water coalescing around her in a roaring vortex.<br>
Peals of thunder and flashes of lightning greet her dark storm, the same black maelstrom re-forming around her.<br>
Kronshtadt fought to suppress the fear tickling her throat back into her heart, clenching her fists tightly to muster what power she had.<br>
The swirling mass in front of her could make the very ocean answer its sinister call. She steeled herself for the waves that would come to smash her consciousness to bits.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kronshtadt：</span><br>
Everyone, get behind–<br>
<br>
The force of the impact engulfed Kronshtadt entirely. But instead of being devoured by it...<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Kronshtadt：</span><br>
"It... doesn't hurt...?"<br>
"I see. This would be the third time... Maybe my body's gotten used to it..."<br>
"Or does this mean... I've grown stronger?"<br>
"This power flowing through me... It feels surprisingly... good."<br>
"Ah... Imagine what I could do to my enemies with this power... How I'd love to sink them, annihilate them..."<br>
"I am a weapon. I want to destroy everything... Missions, duties..."<br>
"...My enemies... Where are they?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Volga：</span><br>
*cough* *cough*... Everyone, are you all right?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Arkhangelsk：</span><br>
Urgh... Somehow, yeah... What in the world was that ridiculous tsunami? My body's hurting all over...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Soobrazitelny：</span><br>
Wait, it's not over yet! We haven't been pulled back to the submarine yet!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kiev：</span><br>
I'm getting a bad feeling about this... We need to get out of here...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Arkhangelsk：</span><br>
Seconded. My rigging's gonna come apart if I get by something like that again!<br>
Kronshtadt, are you okay? Kronsh–<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Kronshtadt：</span><br>
"Targets... sighted."<br>
"...Yes, those are my enemies. Look, over there too."<br>
<br>
Kronshtadt silently turned around and pointed the muzzle of her gun at her "enemies."<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Kronshtadt：</span><br>
"Preparing... to engage the enemies..."<br>
(No... What am I doing...?! Those are my friends!)<br>
<br>
Her main gun discharged. Then her secondary guns. Every tool of violence on her rigging vomited fire and brimstone, an uncontrollable lust for destruction pouring out without end.<br>
Something in front of her collapsed to the ground. That something desperately clutched at the hem of her clothes.<br>
But she didn't stop shooting. She could not stop shooting. She could see nothing, hear nothing, feel nothing, think nothing.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Kronshtadt：</span><br>
Run... Run... away...!<br>
<br>
Kronshtadt could only squeeze a few words out with the last bit of her strength before her consciousness was once again swallowed by darkness.<br>

<br>
FATAL ERROR.<br>
██████ PROGRESS: 89.9%<br>
Kronshtadt opened her eyes and scanned her surroundings. She was back in the Suliko's synchronization chamber.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Kronshtadt：</span><br>
We just... barely made it out...<br>
<br>
She rose to a sitting position and combed her hair in order with her hand.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Kronshtadt：</span><br>
...Arkhangelsk? Where are you?<br>
Volga? Hello?<br>
Kiev? Kiiieeev?<br>
Even you, Soobrazitelny...?<br>
<br>
Her friends were nowhere to be seen.<br>
Strings of letters passed by on the screen in front of her while the faint whirring of a computer fan continued in the background.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Kronshtadt：</span><br>
I'm alone? Where did everyone go?<br>
<br>
Suliko Interior - Bridge<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Kronshtadt：</span><br>
There's no one here either... And it looks like the sub is set to autopilot.<br>
She doesn't seem to be malfunctioning, at least. But I can't turn the autopilot off...<br>
I'll try my communicator... Sigh, no response.<br>
<br>
After searching every nook and cranny of the Suliko, Kronshtadt dragged her weary body back to where she started.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Kronshtadt：</span><br>
Ugh... Headache. Plus now I'm getting dizzy.<br>
I'm the only one left. But I can't possibly pilot and maintain a submarine all by myself...<br>
We... I have failed. The mission is a failure.<br>
Seems my ultimate fate is to be written off as missing in action, along with the Suliko.<br>
...What a miserable climax to my life.<br>
Stranded at the bottom of the ocean, soon to be forgotten by everyone... And I deserve it for betraying my comrades.<br>
<br>
She turned her gaze to the data on the screen. Ordinarily she'd feel like trying to decode it, but now, that felt meaningless to her.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Kronshtadt：</span><br>
...No, it can't end like this...<br>
<br>
She remembered the glimpses she caught of Arkhangelsk before being sent into the dream, and the final step she did to initiate the synchronization process.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Kronshtadt：</span><br>
It's not too late. I'll finish this mission even I have to do it by myself...<br>
I refuse to be forgotten, to perish as a traitor...!<br>
The only thing worse than dying in that dream...<br>
Is to do at the bottom of this abyss all alone!<br>

<br>
Suliko Interior - Bridge<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Soobrazitelny：</span><br>
Ugh... My head hurts...<br>
Is this... the submarine's bridge?<br>
Anyone alive? Kiev? Volga? Arkhangelsk!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kiev：</span><br>
...Too noisy. Shush.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Volga：</span><br>
Nnngh... Did I fall asleep?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kiev：</span><br>
Mm... I had a really lifelike nightmare...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Soobrazitelny：</span><br>
We were trapped in a dense fog... then a black tornado appeared... After that, we were all knocked out by a huge wave...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kiev：</span><br>
Yeah, I had the same dream...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Soobrazitelny：</span><br>
Woah, what are the odds of that? Did we all have the same dream?<br>
Oh right, Kronshtadt said the same thing, didn't she? She was talking about being in a dream, then getting jolted back to reality by that black wave...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Volga：</span><br>
Now that you mention it... Were we able to come back to reality because we were swallowed by that wave?<br>
That incredible pain... Kronshtadt must have endured it those other times as well...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kiev：</span><br>
But, why do I remember now? Shouldn't we forget about the dream after we come back...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Soobrazitelny：</span><br>
I'm not sure, but maybe Kronshtadt has some answers for us!<br>
<br>
Suliko Interior - Synchronization Chamber<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Soobrazitelny：</span><br>
Kronshtadt?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Arkhangelsk：</span><br>
She... doesn't seem to be conscious yet.<br>
<br>
Arkhangelsk pointed to Kronshtadt's immobile figure within the synchronization chair.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Volga：</span><br>
What's going on...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Arkhangelsk：</span><br>
I don't know. When I woke up, I saw her next to me in this state...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Soobrazitelny：</span><br>
What a strange dream... Do you remember anything, Arkhangelsk? Kronshtadt mentioned something about a black tsunami.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Arkhangelsk：</span><br>
Yes, including what happened during the first two loops.<br>
And, during this last loop, she...<br>
Pointed her guns at us, right?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Volga：</span><br>
Yes... I remember that still...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Soobrazitelny：</span><br>
That couldn't have been the real Kronshtadt! She wasn't acting like herself!<br>
But more importantly, why hasn't she woken up yet? Don't tell me she's trapped inside that dream still!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kiev：</span><br>
I'd hate to be stuck in that place...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Volga：</span><br>
Hmm... Do you think we could just wake her up?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Soobrazitelny：</span><br>
Something's telling me that would be a terrible idea.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Volga：</span><br>
Huh? Why?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Soobrazitelny：</span><br>
The device likely interfaces with her brain during the connection process, right? So if we were to sever the connection forcefully, it might cause her psychological damage! Maybe there's a way to stop the process...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Arkhangelsk：</span><br>
I already thought of that... But I can't get it to stop...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Soobrazitelny：</span><br>
Ugh... So that's not an option either, huh? But we can't just leave Kronshtadt like this!<br>
Wait, that's it! If Kronshtadt is trapped inside the dream, why don't we go back in and "finish" it for her?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kiev：</span><br>
Uhh... I don't think we have the time for that...<br>
The Sirens are starting to resume their patrols in this area.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Soobrazitelny：</span><br>
You've got to be shitting me! Did the Sirens notice us already?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Volga：</span><br>
Maybe we should head back to the research base? It's a bit of a gamble, but we can't just leave our comrade behind.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Soobrazitelny：</span><br>
It's not a bad idea on paper, but the synchronization is only made possible by connecting with the meteorite. I have no idea what'll happen if that connection is broken...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Volga：</span><br>
Oh, right...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Soobrazitelny：</span><br>
And didn't Kronshtadt mention the other problem as well? If the Sirens find us while we're ascending, we're goners!<br>
If the submarine goes down, Kronshtadt's gonna be the least of our worries!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Volga：</span><br>
What should we do then? We still have plenty of supplies, but... can we only wait for help?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Soobrazitelny：</span><br>
C'mon, genius mechanic, think! How do we all get out of here alive?<br>
And how do we rescue Kronshtadt from her dream? Graaaaaaah!<br>
All right, we've got to go the distance here. If ascending is not an option, there's only one way to go – deeper!<br>
I dunno how much pressure this submarine can handle, but at least the meteorite's gonna be fine!<br>
Every second we keep diving is another second that we can keep the Sirens from noticing us!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Arkhangelsk：</span><br>
Not like there's anything else we can do... But here's the problem – even if we do manage to bring Kronshtadt back, then what?<br>
Wait... I'm picking up a signal! An... An SOS signal?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Soobrazitelny：</span><br>
Huh? That's impossible, there's no way our comms would work at this depth...<br>
Wait, what? Didn't we originally locate the meteorite thanks to a mysterious signal?<br>
Does that mean it's coming from the meteorite then?! If we can find some way of amplifying it, then it'll be picked up by the research base, and our comrades will know about it!<br>
Next, if we can increase the strength of the connection, we might be able to find a way back into Kronshtadt's dream!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Arkhangelsk：</span><br>
Wait. Who's going to pilot the submarine then? If you strengthen the connection, we're all going to get pulled inside the dream, right?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Soobrazitelny：</span><br>
H-haha... Time to pray that the sub's autopilot function actually works?<br>
Well, maybe I can throw together a quick routine to help it avoid Siren detection... But it won't be good for long.<br>
What other choice do we have at this point? If we don't try something bold and daring, we'll just be waiting for our doom!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Arkhangelsk：</span><br>
Understood. How long does it take to do all of those things?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Soobrazitelny：</span><br>
Heheh! Faster than you can say "Soobrazitelny, the galaxy-brained mechanic!"<br>
<br>
Surrounded by enemies, the Northern Parliament fleet rushed to finalize their desperate measures.<br>
Inside the synchronization chamber, Volga monitored Kronshtadt's condition while keeping an eye on the operation of the connection device.<br>
On the bridge, Kiev was fine-tuning the Siren avoidance routine while Arkhangelsk focused on amplifying the meteorite's signal from inside the communication room.<br>
In a monumental feat of diligence and discipline, the Northern Parliament ships worked together seamlessly to finish their preparations in no time.<br>
With the completion of Soobrazitelny's command, nothing would keep them from their crucial mission.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Soobrazitelny：</span><br>
All righty! That's a real genius mechanic for ya! Did you see that?<br>
How about the signal from the meteorite? We're casually doing all kinds of revolutionary things here, but I hope Soyuz at least manages to get the signal...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Arkhangelsk：</span><br>
There's no guarantee. All we can do is send out the signal to draw in anyone who's paying attention. Also, you never know what might bite.<br>
Hopefully we'll have Kronshtadt back by then too...<br>
I don't want to think about losing another comrade ever again...<br>
Anyway, are you sure everything's ready to go, Soobrazitelny? We can take some time to double-check things if needed.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Soobrazitelny：</span><br>
Way ahead of you! When I'm surrounded by such beautiful machines, it'd be a shame to perform only a single check on them!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Arkhangelsk：</span><br>
Heh. I guess that's true. You still want to head back to the research base and take another look around, right?<br>
Kronshtadt's going to have to put in a good word with Soyuz for you, so you'd better make sure she comes back to us safe and sound!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kiev：</span><br>
All right... Let's go bring her back, together!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Volga：</span><br>
Are we ready to connect then? Let's make ourselves comfortable first~<br>
<br>
After confirming that all preparations were complete, Volga resumed the boot sequence of the connection device.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Volga：</span><br>
3... 2... 1...<br>
See you on the other side, my friends!<br>

<br>
An alien scenery spread out before Kronshtadt's eyes.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Kronshtadt：</span><br>
...So this is the climax of the show.<br>
<br>
Flames danced atop water. Twisted metallic headstones adorned the surface. Unworldly weather raged above the exercise area from before.<br>
An abandoned sector of the sea, ravaged by an unfathomable storm that consumed everything in its path.<br>
The grand fleet that had once dotted the horizon was now nothing more than a graveyard, a solemn witness to the calamity that had passed over it.<br>
Flames, smoke, and blackened waters. Even the very air choked the senses in this apocalyptic hellscape.<br>
Only one thing continued to dance in the gala of death and destruction.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Kronshtadt：</span><br>
It seems... alive.<br>
No, it always was...<br>
<br>
Flames and storms raging all around her, Kronshtadt took aim with her main guns as she approached the black tornado.<br>
Kronshtadt knew she had to confront it. No matter how many tries it took or how much time passed.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Kronshtadt：</span><br>
If I defeat you, then the operation... My mission... can finally end...<br>
<br>
She turned her eyes towards the figure at the heart of the maelstrom – Bon Homme Richard.<br>
Kronshtadt could not see the girl. But she could feel her presence.<br>
As if answering her, a laughter began to ring out in her head, both innocent and maniacal.<br>
<span style="color:#696969;">???：</span><br>
Defeat me? Why would you want to do that?<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Kronshtadt：</span><br>
I must complete my mission.<br>
<span style="color:#696969;">???：</span><br>
Why? Is that mission really that important to you?<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Kronshtadt：</span><br>
I will defeat you, put an end to this dream, and return to the Northern Parliament with my comrades.<br>
<span style="color:#696969;">???：</span><br>
Comrades? No, no, Kronshtadt. Don't you remember how you hunted them down yourself?<br>
There is no camaraderie in this world. Only temporary alliances out of convenience.<br>
Your Northern Parliament is no different. They only support you when they need something from you.<br>
Friendship. Factions. Loyalty. You don't need those things. You don't need any of those things.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Kronshtadt：</span><br>
Shut your crazed, lying mouth!<br>
I will defeat you, solve the mystery of this meteorite, and bring my comrades back...!<br>
<span style="color:#696969;">???：</span><br>
Hahah! Is that so? I see, I see.<br>
Even if you manage to defeat me, all that proves is that you have great power.<br>
But power is fearsome. That applies to countries, to factions, to organizations, and to people.<br>
People seek power for themselves, but when they get it, all that power does is breed fear.<br>
Isn't that ironic? Isn't that hilarious?<br>
Face it, Kronshtadt. Even if you defeat me, no glory awaits you. Your "comrades" won't ever come back.<br>
You are all alone. Forlorn. Shunned. Denounced. Destroyed.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Kronshtadt：</span><br>
No, you're wrong! You know nothing about my comrades or the Northern Parliament!<br>
<span style="color:#696969;">???：</span><br>
You are the one who knows nothing.<br>
Everything is a lie, a convenient excuse to use you... to use the KAN-SEN.<br>
Yes... Kindness, support, respect. It's all a lie.<br>
The glories afforded to you are cheap tokens to buy your loyalty, good for nothing but manipulating you.<br>
The moment they realize they are unable to control you...<br>
Is the moment they will come for you to destroy you. After all, what is an unusable weapon but a heap of scrap metal?<br>
If you still won't admit it, then show me that power.<br>
Defeat me! Destroy me! ERASE MY EXISTENCE!<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

<br>
Kronshtadt pumped shell after shell into the black tornado, resuming the symphony of destruction with a new movement.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Kronshtadt：</span><br>
"Die! Die! DIE!"<br>
<br>
She had lost all control of her emotions, becoming a puppet to her pure lust for destruction, her existence reduced to unload her entire arsenal at her target.<br>
The tornado, meanwhile, simply took it all. It did not retaliate or even defend itself.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Kronshtadt：</span><br>
(How laughable... Am I really trying to kill a storm?)<br>
(It's a force of nature, not a living being. I'm making a fool of myself...)<br>
(But... Pointless as it may be...)<br>
<br>
Her assault did not let up.<br>
<span style="color:#696969;">???：</span><br>
Is that the best you can do, lady? You've not left as much as a dent on me!<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Kronshtadt：</span><br>
"Shut up! You've not seen the start of it!"<br>
<br>
Her identity was being overwritten. Her consciousness began to wane.<br>
Soon destruction would be the only thing she could think of. Soon she would be no more than a living weapon.<br>
Her comrades, her allegiance, her duty, her mission – everything she held dear was being reduced to forgotten memories.<br>
Never before had something felt so reprehensibly wrong. And yet she couldn't stop firing. Her power grew and grew without limit.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Kronshtadt：</span><br>
"AHAHAHAHAHAHAH!"<br>
"Prepare to meet your end! Drop dead already! DIEEEEE!"<br>
<br>
Richard was right there, standing right in front of her.<br>
With a smile like a fallen angel, she pressed her little head against the barrel of Kronshtadt's cannon.<br>
<span style="color:#696969;">???：</span><br>
You've almost got me, lady.<br>
A little more should do it~♪<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Kronshtadt：</span><br>
No... No! This isn't like me! I would never...!<br>
<br>
Despite her rejection, she could not stop firing. The world turned pitch black, and she realized then that she was on the brink of METAmorphosis.<br>
But then... a ray of light shone through to Kronshtadt.<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=Abyssal Refrain|选项=29|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Kronshtadt：</span><br>
(..................)<br>
(Huh...?)<br>
(What... happened to me...)<br>
<br>
The black tornado was no longer there. Nor were Richard, the wrecks, or the exercise area.<br>
Kronshtadt instead found herself in a strange, concrete hall.<br>
Columns of lamps illuminated her surroundings with a faint light.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Kronshtadt：</span><br>
(Maybe I've finally arrived at the gates of heaven...)<br>
<br>
Kronshtadt wandered out of the hall without any sense of purpose, trudging into a corridor. Suddenly, a plain wooden door caught her attention.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Kronshtadt：</span><br>
(Huh, I wonder what's in here...)<br>
<br>
The moment her fingertips brushed against the doorknob, the white concrete hall transformed into a dimly-lit room.<br>
Books and scraps of paper littered the floor, and opposite her in this horribly cluttered room sat a woman at her desk, writing something.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Female Researcher：</span><br>
I don't understand... How did this happen?<br>
Her Wisdom Cube... Why did that happen...?<br>
I've never seen anything like it before...<br>
I don't understand... I just don't understand...<br>
<br>
BANG! She swung her fist without thinking, knocking over a stack of books.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Kronshtadt：</span><br>
(Watch out!)<br>
<br>
Kronshtadt instinctively rushed over to shield the woman from the falling books, but they slipped through her body and crashed all over the desk and the floor.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Kronshtadt：</span><br>
(What...?!)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Female Researcher：</span><br>
Damnit... That hurt...<br>
If only I could see the test data... But I don't have any clearance anymore...<br>
I'll have to count on Dr. Aoste then... and focus on doing what I can do right here!<br>
Don't give up! If anyone can crack this problem, it's you, Anzeel!<br>
<br>
Kronshtadt tried to reach out to the woman, but the moment she did so, the scenery around her warped and whisked her back to the previous hallway.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Kronshtadt：</span><br>
(Was that a researcher? What a slovenly lifestyle... Not that I have any right to judge others though...)<br>
(I don't know who she is or what she's doing, but I hope she succeeds.)<br>
<br>
Continuing down the corridor, she came across another door.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Kronshtadt：</span><br>
(What's behind this one? Another vision?)<br>
<br>
This room was lit even more dimly than the last. Kronshtadt could just make out the silhouettes of an adult man and a young girl.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">？：</span><br>
Magister, your calculation has been completed.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Male Researcher：</span><br>
It's finally done?! What are the results?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">？：</span><br>
The results indicate that the proposed safety lock mechanism is able to satisfy project specifications.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Male Researcher：</span><br>
I see... This is great news. We've finally done it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">？：</span><br>
I will consider the task complete, then. However, I could perform further calculations if you would like a more stable alternative.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Male Researcher：</span><br>
No need. What we've got now strikes the perfect balance between stability and energy output ratio.<br>
Stability comes at the cost of output – limiting it too much would be to put the cart before the horse.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">？：</span><br>
Do you not have faith in Antiochus as a contingency plan?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Male Researcher：</span><br>
That's not what I'm saying. I'm just biased towards those girls, perhaps because Anzeel sees so much in them.<br>
Her incessant gushing has piqued my curiosity. Now I, too, want to observe this "Awakening" process that unlocks their latent potential.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">？：</span><br>
What of the Bon Homme Richard incident? Do you believe it to be an example of an Awakening?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Male Researcher：</span><br>
Don't be ridiculous. That was the opposite of an Awakening – it was more akin to the girls reverting to their original selves.<br>
That is to say, their Wisdom Cubes underwent the process of degenerating into Origin Cubes. Knowing Anzeel, she's brainstorming a snappy term for it as we speak.<br>
And if she is, she really should be working on something more important.<br>
You know how it goes. When Anzeel slacks, I have to watch her back.<br>
Oh, that reminds me. It's about time I had a talk with our assistant.<br>
<br>
When the conversation in the dimly-lit room wrapped up, Kronshtadt found herself back in the white corridor once more.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Kronshtadt：</span><br>
(Another researcher? Huh... Who was that "assistant" he mentioned?)<br>
(Surely not the little girl? She looked young enough to be his daughter. Far too young to be a lab assistant.)<br>
(Beyond that, I didn't get a word of what they were talking about. Sigh... If only Soobrazitelny were here. She could make sense of it.)<br>
(Wait... If only who were here? Who's Soobrazitelny?)<br>
(I've never heard that name before, and yet... It feels familiar, for some reason.)<br>
(Soobrazitelny... Soobra...zitelny... Oh!)<br>
<br>
Repeating the name buried in the back of her mind caused an unexpected third door to appear right before her.<br>
The vision on the other side seemed to be set in some sort of assembly hall, or a theater.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Female Researcher：</span><br>
Should we leave some sort of message here?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">■■■：</span><br>
This is the final stage of the safety lock. If they got this far, they should already have Awakened... or they're on the brink of doing the opposite.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Female Researcher：</span><br>
I mean, why not write something at least? It'll be like a fun little Easter egg.<br>
They might read it and gain the strength they need to overcome a great tragedy.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">■■■：</span><br>
Frankly, that notion is almost too silly to entertain. Nevertheless... I'll put my faith in that genius instinct of yours, Anzeel.<br>
You should be the first to leave a message though, not me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Female Researcher：</span><br>
Oof... Dumping the toughest task on me, huh?<br>
"Heya, little shipgirl! Good job finding this message! Hope you have a great day!"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">■■■：</span><br>
I hate to be a critic, but maybe you could... tone it down a little?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Female Researcher：</span><br>
Yeah, I guess you're right... Okay, how about this:<br>
"Hang in there, child of the Creator."<br>
"Your very existence is a miracle born from the hopes and hearts of countless people."<br>
"Face the darkness, but don't let it consume you! Mama's cheering for you!"<br>
Better?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">■■■：</span><br>
Serious, yet light-hearted at the same time... I'm not sure what kind of message that'll send.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Female Researcher：</span><br>
Look, I'm a researcher, not a writer! This is the best I can do!<br>
Now it's your turn to write something!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">■■■：</span><br>
I'm not sure I could come up with something in the spur of the moment... Can I sleep on it first?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Female Researcher：</span><br>
Nuh-uh, you're not getting off that easy! You're doing it right now!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">■■■：</span><br>
Fine... Let's see then––<br>
<br>

<span style="color:#ff9900;">Kronshtadt：</span><br>
These people are... interesting, even if I still have no clue what anyone's talking about.<br>
I recognize one of them. She's the female researcher from before, I think.<br>
And the other person... Nope, doesn't ring a bell. Must be someone important, though.<br>
Mentioned something about a "genius instinct," though... That reminds me of how Soobrazitelny always goes around calling herself a genius.<br>
And then there's Kiev, Volga, and of course, Arkhangelsk...<br>
My... My comrades...!<br>
Yes! I remember now! I remember all of it!<br>
I would never forget about my comrades! And they would never forget about me!<br>
What am I doing here... I've got my duty to fulfill, and the Northern Parliament to return home to!<br>
I know you can hear me! Get me out of here and put me back where I belong!<br>
Take me back home, to where I belong!<br>

Kronshtadt's fractured senses pieced themselves back together, her consciousness clawing its way out of the void.<br>
Next came her humanity, then her emotions, flooding back into her being.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kronshtadt：</span><br>
*cough* *cough*! Wh-which loop is this?!<br>
Enough is enough, please... I think I've endured enough punishment already...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Arkhangelsk：</span><br>
Kronshtadt! You came back to us!<br>
You wouldn't believe how long you slept. Frankly, I considered waking you with brute force more than a few times.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kronshtadt：</span><br>
That explains why my whole body hurts... Violence is never the answer, Arkhangelsk.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Arkhangelsk：</span><br>
I only said I considered it. Maybe I'll give you a friendly whupping after we've returned to reality, though.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kronshtadt：</span><br>
Heheh. Hit me with your best shot.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Arkhangelsk：</span><br>
So, what now? Everyone's gathered in one place – do you have a plan?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kronshtadt：</span><br>
Yes. I've gathered all the intel we'll need. All that's left is to finish this just the way I like it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Volga：</span><br>
Please pace yourself, okay? We'll gladly take part of the burden off your back.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Soobrazitelny：</span><br>
Exactly! You have a genius mechanic at your disposal – use her!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kiev：</span><br>
All we have to do is beat this big thing up, right?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kronshtadt：</span><br>
No, we're not doing that. You can't beat a force of nature.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Soobrazitelny：</span><br>
Then what? If we don't strike now while it's sitting around, it'll overwhelm us with its waves again!<br>
<br>
The black tornado was still spinning, but its intimidating presence and air of madness were gone. Now it was no more than a destructive storm.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kronshtadt：</span><br>
(It's lost its menacing edge... You've shown me everything you had to show, is that it?)<br>
(Or is this just the aftermath of it all, and it's our job to take care of it?)<br>
(If so, it's a humiliating reminder of how stupid I was to think I could fight a tornado with cannon fire.)<br>
It doesn't matter. I will finish this mission no matter what and go home with my comrades and the data we gathered!<br>
And if anything or anyone tries to stand in our way, we will fight until it is no more!<br>
All ships! Aim for the tornado's center! Hit it with everything you've got!<br>
<br>
"Prototype submarine Suliko approaching maximum depth."<br>
"Impact in 3... 2... 1..."<br>
"......"<br>
The Suliko hit the seafloor, sending out shockwaves that rippled through the meteorite and the surrounding environment.<br>
Seemingly in response, the Sirens in the area adopted more aggressive behavioral protocols.<br>
The raised threat level posed a significant challenge for search parties in the area. This, coupled with the confidential nature of the mission, put a temporary stop to major rescue efforts.<br>
But, at no point did any shipgirl from the Northern Parliament forget that their comrades were out here, somewhere.<br>
Their search continued for any lead that might lead them to the girls' whereabouts. They waited, restlessly, for a chance to rescue their missing comrades.<br>
Beneath the endless ice, an echo continued to emanate from the depths, an abyssal refrain waiting to be heard.<br>

Northern Parliament Research Base - Nearby Waters<br>
The Northern Parliament's submarine followed the signal into the depths of the ocean.<br>
The time had finally come. With the Commander's aid, the Siren activity in the Polar region was finally curbed enough to allow the search to continue.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tashkent：</span><br>
Belorussiya, there are some Siren submarines up ahead.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetskaya Belorussiya：</span><br>
Take them out, Tashkent. Don't miss.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tashkent：</span><br>
Yeah, yeah. Ready, steady... fire!<br>
3... 2... 1... Direct hit confirmed. The target is down.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetskaya Belorussiya：</span><br>
Heh... Good thing we didn't come here defenseless. The data Commander provided for us was invaluable.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Avrora：</span><br>
This vessel is a more polished product than the Suliko.<br>
But, the Suliko still should have enough energy and supplies to keep those girls alive...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetskaya Belorussiya：</span><br>
It's hard to say. While there should've been enough supplies to last for a year, no ship should be able to continuously operate in these conditions...<br>
At this point, we can only pray for their safety...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Avrora：</span><br>
.........<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tashkent：</span><br>
Look, there it is! Kronshtadt's submarine!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Avrora：</span><br>
...Let's get ready.<br>
Prepare to approach the Suliko, Belorussiya! Let us go greet the heroes of the Northern Parliament!<br>

<br>
Back at the Northern Parliament<br>
Sovetsky Soyuz reunited with Kronshtadt at a grand parade celebrating the return of the long-lost heroes.<br>
The fact that they were able to return home safely brought relief to the hearts of many, but just as importantly– the information they gathered while connecting with the meteorite would surely pave a new path for the Northern Parliament.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kronshtadt：</span><br>
Some things never change, huh? It's good to be back home.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
Indeed. This is the place where we belong, and it will always await us with open arms.<br>
How was your trip back?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kronshtadt：</span><br>
I guess I got the first-class treatment? In any case, I slept through most of it.<br>
Somehow, our resident genius mechanic still had the energy to go back to the research base.<br>
.........<br>
Honestly, I never thought I'd be able to see my home again.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
Yes, it was a miracle for us as well to find that you were still alive. We've never stopped thinking about your disappearance since that time–<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kronshtadt：</span><br>
So, time didn't seem to be flowing normally inside the chamber?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
Correct. Apparently you stayed asleep inside the chamber the entire time until you were found. But nothing else had changed.<br>
It was as if time stood still.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kronshtadt：</span><br>
...Let's set that aside for now. No matter how deep the submarine dove, there's no way that time itself would freeze over inside the chamber.<br>
But, if that had anything to do with the Siren technology we were using, it becomes clear why they are so keenly interested in the meteorite.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
...So what do you plan on doing next? Do you want some time off, or do you plan to resume your training?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kronshtadt：</span><br>
I am always prepared to give more for the Northern Parliament, Soyuz.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
We appreciate your service, comrade.<br>
Welcome home, Kronshtadt.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kronshtadt：</span><br>
*sigh*... Hah, it's good to be back, my friend.<br>
...Sorry to have kept you waiting!<br>

Royal Isles - Queen's Palace<br>
Suffolk was running through the palace's corridors, a stack of documents in her arms.<br>
She had set the alarm to wake herself up earlier, but slept right through it after having slapped the snooze button repeatedly.<br>
Thus, she had no choice but to try to take some shortcuts through some unfamiliar halls.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suffolk：</span><br>
Ugh... I'm going to make a fool of myself in front of Her Majesty...<br>
*pant* *pant* ...Huh? Did I make a wrong turn somewhere? This was supposed to get me there faster...<br>
W-wait, did I get lost?!<br>
<br>
She noticed that she was no longer surrounded by the palace's brightly-decorated corridors, but instead had entered a strange place with unnatural-looking walls.<br>
She had never seen any place like this before, but assumed it had to be somewhere beneath the palace.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suffolk：</span><br>
Ugh... Did I somehow end up getting lost in the palace basement?<br>
If the Head Maid finds out about this, she's going to give me an earful...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">???：</span><br>
Oh my, if it isn't Suffolk. I wasn't expecting guests today~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suffolk：</span><br>
Eep?!<br>
Wh-who's there?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">???：</span><br>
There's no need to be alarmed, heehee~ I was just thinking how rare it is to see a member of the Maid Team get lost~♪<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suffolk：</span><br>
Miss Neptune! What are you doing here?<br>
Wait, I need to deliver these materials to Her Majesty right away! S-sorry!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">???：</span><br>
I see, I see~ You're on some important business, aren't you?<br>
That being the case, allow me to show you the way~♪<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suffolk：</span><br>
Really? Thank you so much, Miss Neptune! You're a lifesaver!<br>
Phew... Maybe I can avoid sitting through the Head Maid's lectures at this rate...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sheffield：</span><br>
I wouldn't be so sure about that. You ARE late, after all.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suffolk：</span><br>
Sheffy?! Bleh, I was afraid this was going to happen...<br>
More importantly, did you come looking for me? How'd you know where I'd be?<br>
I was trying to get these materials over to Her Majesty, but ended up getting lost and wandering my way here...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sheffield：</span><br>
It happens. This place was relocated in a hurry after all, so the passages might not be reflected in our existing maps.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suffolk：</span><br>
Huh...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sheffield：</span><br>
Don't worry about it. We planned to turn this place into a storage place for some of Her Majesty's toys. Let's head somewhere less clammy first.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suffolk：</span><br>
Thanks a ton, Sheffy!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sheffield：</span><br>
It's no big deal. Oh, and one more thing...<br>
Her Majesty said that this area is to be kept secret. Speak not a single word of it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suffolk：</span><br>
Got it! Anyway, let's get those documents to Her Majesty before she gets angry! Let's pick up the pace, Sheffy!<br>

Eagle Union - NY City<br>
After receiving the Naval HQ's response regarding the "Reenactment," Saratoga locked herself in a conference room, thinking hard about the next step.<br>
The risk of communications between factions breaking down. The possibility of a Siren counterattack. The Commander's response...<br>
It would not be until several hours later when Saratoga finally decided to make her move.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
This probably isn't the brightest idea, but I don't see any other way...<br>
If things are left to continue down this path, we're all going to be in danger, including the Commander.<br>
.........<br>
This has got to be the only way! I'm sure of it!<br>
At least, things can't get any weirder than they already are right now!<br>
<br>
Saratoga took out a communicator used only for top-security protocols, and started to connect to a certain channel.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB ：</span><br>
Communication line confirmed. Checking integrity of intel security... Confirmed.<br>
Checking authorization of the correspondent–––<br>
Identity confirmed as CV-3 Saratoga, Eagle Union.<br>
Authorization confirmed. Please state your query.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
Please connect me to Alaska in the "Sea of Stars."<br>
It's about time we show the Commander some secrets of our own... Hehe~♪<br>
