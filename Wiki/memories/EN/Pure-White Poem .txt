White Poem<br>
<br>
I Birth<br>
I am Klarheit.<br>
Born from the nothingness; an image of steel given consciousness.<br>
<br>
Born into this world, I am a weapon;<br>
to guard the light of civilization, the purpose for which I was constructed.<br>
Port - Command Office<br>
From the mouths of lifeforms like me explained. in front stood the one they called "Commander", to whom I was to introduce myself.<br>
Utilizing the knowledge I had gleaned; the proper way to address this person, was now to sing forth with my vocal chords.<br>
Z46：<br>
Was it you who summoned me to this place?<br>
<br>
Call sign recognized, class has been confirmed. They also match the info from before.<br>
Z46：<br>
I am...<br>
<br>
... only now did I discover, I knew not a name which I could utter.<br>
The Iron Blood girl who introduced herself; before me, eagerly, as Z35...<br>
Z46：<br>
It pains me to say, I still lack a name. Just for the time being, please call me Viersechs.<br>
<br>
"Your name symbolizes your existence" ...if that is the case, what I did just now; casually assigning myself a name, may well have been a foolish thing to do.<br>
A wave of uneasiness flowed through me; I lost confidence in this sudden name.<br>
Z46：<br>
What do you think? Is it not apropos?<br>
<br>
... Turns out, it was accepted easily.<br>
To begin with, this body was granted. My calling is to follow orders, but...<br>
Z46：<br>
Until I can discover my real name, Viersechs shall become the string that binds us.<br>
Now, my new master, take hold of this string. Please become my light, guide me down my path!<br>
<br>
Even if you must call me by this name; show this Klarheit, me, colors of the world.<br>

<br>
II Trajectory<br>
I am Grundfarbe, primary colors. <br>
I am but a doll with a borrowed name, seeking the meaning of my existence.<br>
<br>
Starting from today I've begun to serve... as secretary of the <br>
"Commander", the one who leads all fleet operations.<br>
Port - Command Office<br>
Z46：<br>
Is it fine to put these resources here? Mm... I shall do as you have commanded.<br>
...Humans are amusing beings after all. Even just to simply move some weapons, one must first fill out so much paperwork.<br>
Procuring and storing our precious fuel, securing ammunition and rations, acquiring and disposing of supplies, performing maintenance on equipment, even tracking personal expenses... daily life proves to be quite cumbersome.<br>
Having that said, this arrangement is fine. Being secretary indeed has its perks; it can sometimes provide the illusion, that I have some say in running the fleet.<br>
<br>
Though there is much I do not understand, since serving as the secretary ship, my world has already begun to change.<br>
Instead of thinking of vanquishing foes, the focus is now "to prevent defeat."<br>
To not only "fight", but also to "live".<br>
Z46：<br>
I have come to deliver the reports. Commander, please accept my humble work.<br>
I have finished accounting for this month; the Iron Blood Dorm is barely in the red.<br>
Conservation is of utmost import; and though destroyers accept this tenet, the heavy cruisers were hard to persuade. Battleships have always been expensive, and because of that, it's hard to cut costs.<br>
<br>
(Receives headpats)<br>
Z46：<br>
Though I understand the meaning of praise, I still know not the purpose of this touch. <br>
If it will not increase what I am paid, what is the benefit of such contact?<br>
<br>
Before I could not even understand, what purpose this "praise" was possibly for. I feel that I have moved forward a bit. Is this the "progress" of which people speak?  <br>
"Physical contact..." I still don't get it. Though my curious heart longs to find out, once the waves of battle come crashing in, such idle thoughts are quickly tossed aside.<br>
Perhaps, I should pay more heed to my heart<br>

III Interlude I<br>
Port - Dormitory<br>
Z46：<br>
What opine you all, about this outfit? I am not yet sure what clothes I should choose; thus I hope, you can offer me guidance.<br>
Karl Galster (Z20)：<br>
This is a bit lacking... You're no Zed. You can dress in something a bit prettier, Viersechs~<br>
Wilhelm Heidkamp (Z21)：<br>
That's right... You're the overly serious type, so you're likely to choose clothes that are too bland. Wouldn't asking Miss Fünf be more helpful?<br>
Hermann Künne (Z19)：<br>
I think this outfit is just fine though...<br>
Karl Galster (Z20)：<br>
You're just as bad as Zed, so you don't count!<br>
Hermann Künne (Z19)：<br>
Ehhhhh?!<br>
Wilhelm Heidkamp (Z21)：<br>
Fünf and Lebe dress way too gaudily. How about asking Lüde?<br>
Z46：<br>
…………<br>
Karl Galster (Z20)：<br>
Lüde just goes along with anything, so that's out. Ah! Sechs might be the one we're looking for!<br>
Hermann Künne (Z19)：<br>
I thought Sechs' clothes were picked out by Fünf...?<br>
Wilhelm Heidkamp (Z21)：<br>
Then, Sechs won't work either... In that case, I suppose the three of us should come up with something for Viersechs...<br>
Z46：<br>
…………<br>
Karl Galster (Z20)：<br>
Ah! I'm so sorry, Viersechs. We got lost in our own conversation here >__<<br>
Wilhelm Heidkamp (Z21)：<br>
Um... this is winter attire anyway, so you'd probably need something else for summer. Uhh... let's pair this with this, and add a parka to avoid sunburns. How's that?<br>
Z46：<br>
It looks fine to me, let's go with this then.<br>
Hermann Künne (Z19)：<br>
Jeez, everyone, you tossed Viersechs aside to prattle on with your own conversations. Shouldn't it be enough to just let her pick what she wants?<br>
Z46：<br>
Thank you very much, I'll do as you said.<br>
<br>
For some reason, I found it difficult; to join their discussion, delicately.<br>

White Poem<br>
<br>
IV Thought<br>
I am Mischfarbe, my thoughts intertwined.<br>
A chiaroscuro of hued reflections, passing through the lens of society.<br>
Today, I carry with me a package. Bearing instructions from the Commander, <br>
I am to go to the pier of the dock, to seek the one who clads herself in ice.<br>
Port - Pier<br>
Z46：<br>
Tirpitz, I've come with commander's package.<br>
Tirpitz：<br>
Viersechs? Thank you, I'll take care of it.<br>
<br>
To Tirpitz, the "Lonely Queen of the North", the battleship who clad herself in ice, I passed the package from the Commander.<br>
Tirpitz：<br>
Viersechs, so you're on secretary duty now? What are your plans for later?<br>
Z46：<br>
Other than plans to return to my dorm, no other plans seem to come to my mind.<br>
Tirpitz：<br>
Is that so? Then, you should keep me company for a while. I still find it easier to talk with you.<br>
Z46：<br>
Though that much is fine, I must warn you first: I struggle greatly to find what to say. If you do not mind, an ear I can lend.<br>
Tirpitz：<br>
Of course, that is no problem at all. I'm no stranger to talking to myself.<br>
<br>
I heard many fascinating stories. Of words exchanged with the other factions, of the state of ships not yet completed, and of the journey of Tirpitz herself, who was beaten by our combined forces.<br>
I heard many harrowing stories too. Of the demise of the past Iron Blood, of the "other her" from the Mirror Seas, of comrades trapped in eternal warfare, and of uncertainty towards things to come.<br>
From time to time, I'd nod in agreement; seeing through her eyes, sharing her world view; with what words I knew, offering sympathy.<br>
Tirpitz：<br>
Viersechs, what would you like to do in the future?<br>
Z46：<br>
Me? I... ... ...<br>
<br>
Suddenly confronted with this question, I once again found myself without words.<br>
What... color am I?<br>

V Interlude II<br>
Port - Academy<br>
Graf Zeppelin：<br>
This sausage bares flavor more delicious than usual.<br>
Z46：<br>
Graf, you too have changed, since coming to here. Your pickling technique became quite divine.<br>
Graf Zeppelin：<br>
It takes a lot of focus just to keep our own ship rigging in check. You must be extra careful around girls from other factions. Viersechs, thanks for all your help.<br>
Z46：<br>
Think nothing of it, my very close friend. It is natural to lend you my aid.<br>
Graf Zeppelin：<br>
Close friends, is it? Heh... that's not something I ever expected to hear from a destroyer. But in Viersech's case... it somehow doesn't feel strange at all.<br>
Z46：<br>
Also, I've done nothing worthy of praise. For fellow members of the Iron Blood, helping each other needs no second thought.<br>
Graf Zeppelin：<br>
Even if that is the case, I do have a suggestion for you, Viersechs. Could you do something about the way you talk?<br>
Z46：<br>
Graf, are you in a position to talk? But what exactly is wrong with my speech?<br>
Graf Zeppelin：<br>
Aren't you having some trouble fitting in with the other destroyers? Why don't you try to learn a little?<br>
... to talk a bit more like them?<br>
Z46：<br>
…………<br>
Graf Zeppelin：<br>
Viersechs?<br>
Z46：<br>
I... I'll give it a shot... "okay."<br>
Graf Zeppelin：<br>
Mhm. Continue to do your best. I shall be cheering for you.<br>
Z46：<br>
Mm... Next time... we'll share lunch together as well, right?<br>
Graf Zeppelin：<br>
Ah, of course.<br>
<br>
I reached my spoon forth into Graf's lunchbox, and brought back her sauerkraut risotto. The food soon disappeared into my mouth.<br>

White Poem<br>
<br>
VI Fetters<br>
The combat operation has ended.<br>
Over ten types of mass-produced vessels. Some highly-ranking enemy "Pieces." Though only classified as medium tier, the enemies proved to be difficult, for our fleet had depleted its supplies.<br>
With all the strength I could muster, I fought.<br>
My main cannons fired dozens of times. I did not cease my relentless attacks,  until my body was covered in wounds, until my overheated guns sputtered.<br>
My riggings and clothes had lost their color. They had been stained gray with the smoke of war.<br>
Port - Command Office<br>
Z46：<br>
This report of the battle that took place... please do not forget to give it a look.<br>
<br>
―― Why did I fight until the brink of death?<br>
Z46：<br>
Our ships put forth the best effort we could, even as we fired our last bullets. Should the enemy know the thing called "pride", they too would feel good for giving their all. <br>
<br>
—— Why did I choose not to retreat at all?<br>
Z46：<br>
We strove to attain the best combat results. From the perspective of consequences, we struck a severe blow into their heart, a better outcome than a quick retreat.<br>
<br>
—— Why did I not even treasure my life?<br>
Z46：<br>
Though I also serve as secretary, in the end I am still but a weapon. The fact that I only exist to fight, is perhaps something that never will change.<br>
Before the existence of this "Viersechs", I was first laid down during the Great War. I carried with me great expectations; the sign I was given, "Z46".<br>
<br>
At this time I felt my heart and soul cry; if there was a way to escape this fate, bestow me a name and grant it meaning. <br>
Grant upon me, not the weapon you see, but the girl that you would want me to be. Help me bring to light my reason to fight.<br>
Grant upon me, you who I love dearly, a name that calls me back home to your side.<br>
Please grant me my very own color.<br>

White Poem<br>
<br>
VII Pure White<br>
"That isn't true." Words rejecting my existence as a weapon. Words that rejected the gray I had become.<br>
"Viersechs has her own thoughts and her desires, therefore she is human." I am not a pure being that lacks an ego. Therefore, I am not transparent.<br>
"Viersechs should cherish herself more." Though my name is a borrowed one, "I" am still worth cherishing.<br>
Then... I must know...<br>
Z46：<br>
Oh my beloved, what color am I?<br>
Please teach me the meaning of being "me." How do I become the "me" you desire?<br>
I will change myself so I can be yours, the kind of person you'd want me to be.<br>
<br>
—— "Viersechs, just be yourself."<br>
I received my answer.<br>
Z46：<br>
My color... should be Weiss.<br>
So that you may dye me with your color, I have dyed myself an innocent white.<br>
No matter how many times I am stained with smoke and soot, I want to become the kind of "person" who can wash away the grayness inside her heart over and over again.<br>
<br>
With this vow I dedicate to you, the "Commander" who stands in front of me, I pledge to give all of me.<br>
My words, my embrace, my kiss. And all of my blessings.<br>
Z46：<br>
I hope that I can become... the pure white that you desire.<br>
