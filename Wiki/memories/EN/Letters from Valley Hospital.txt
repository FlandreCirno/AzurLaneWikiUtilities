Letters from Valley Hospital<br>
<br>
1 Prologue<br>
I never would've thought a regular old letter would lead me to a place like this.<br>
Half a year ago, I received my last letter from Miller.<br>
As long-time investigation partners, she and I have constantly stayed in touch.<br>
This time, though, her correspondence had an ominous quality to it.<br>
In the letter, she sang the praises of the sights around Valley Hospital, where she'd been admitted for a commissioned investigation.<br>
Things quickly took a shocking turn, however, and she began telling me about the unnerving things she'd experienced.<br>
The downright excessive friendliness of the hospital staff, someone interfering with her investigation, hasty footsteps echoing in the night...<br>
After that final letter, there was not so much as a peep from her.<br>
I tried again and again to contact Valley Hospital, only to receive the same answer each time.<br>
"Upon examination, we could find no patient in our care under the name of Miller."<br>
Given the seriousness of the situation, I began secretly looking into this hospital myself.<br>
On the surface, it is indeed a comprehensive medical institution that performs medical research and provides outpatient care and high-end medical services.<br>
Through my investigation, I learned that there have been disappearances of homeless people in the area around the hospital.<br>
Not only that, there have also been cases of ordinary former patients going missing following the end of their stay.<br>
My detective's instinct told me two things: That Miller had been caught up in some extraordinary incident, and that I need to spring into action immediately.<br>
After determining my entry point, I spent a lot of money bribing key people and forging a perfect ID.<br>
Starting today, I will be hospitalized under the guise of a naval commander who needs treatment for high stress.<br>
And so, I got into a wobbly rustbucket and headed for the hospital nestled deep in the mountains.<br>
Once I finally reach my destination, I gasp in awe of the scenery, far more beautiful than I had imagined.<br>
There, Valley Hospital stands – a red brick building, bathed in sunlight and glowing warmly.<br>
All around me, old oak trees stand proud while the wind blows through a well-maintained garden, the faint scent of flowers gracing my nose.<br>
I arrive at the hospital entrance and find several nurses already waiting for me there.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Franklin：</span><br>
Welcome, Commander. We've been waiting for you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mogador：</span><br>
Commaaander... You smell so hot... Heheh...<br>
I wanna get a good taste of you later during our... examination... heheh...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Voroshilov：</span><br>
Rest assured, our hospital provides the finest service. I guarantee you'll have a wonderful time here.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suzuya：</span><br>
Should you have any questions, I'm always happy to help.<br>
We will protect your health like one would a fine treasure.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Franklin：</span><br>
Heehee. Alright, wrap it up, girls. We have all the time in the world.<br>
Commander, allow me to guide you through the admittance procedure.<br>
As you see, the hospital is divided into five areas: The medical center, the inpatient building, the recuperation center, the logistics center, and the research center.<br>
You're free to come and go through these areas during the day. If you need any help, the head nurse of each area will assist you.<br>
However, after the sun sets, you have to follow the staff's instructions and rest in your room, okay?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
Alright. I understand.<br>
(I'll have to keep my investigating to the night hours, then...)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Franklin：</span><br>
Okay, then come with me. The reception's over here.<br>
<br>
And so, I successfully infiltrated Valley Hospital as a regular patient.<br>
It's time to start my investigation in earnest.<br>
Wait for me, Miller, my good old partner.<br>
I swear on my honor that I'll bring you back.——<br>

<br>
THUD!<br>
The door to the sickroom shuts, and then the footsteps that had been wandering in the area grow more distant.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
(Those creepy nurses should be gone by now.)<br>
<br>
As soon as I breathe a sigh of relief, the curtains around my bed are pulled aside with a hard tug.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mogador：</span><br>
Huff... Puff... I knew I could smell you...<br>
I've got you now, Commander!<br>
Caught off guard, I'm suddenly pushed flat onto the bed. Before I can even fight back, Mogador mounts me, her face flushed and breathing heavily.<br>
I can't help but wonder – why would our dear patient hide in here all alone? Ahah♥<br>
Her eyes are darting everywhere, her body is hot to the touch, and she's shockingly strong. One thing is clear: She's not thinking straight.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
(Something's wrong with her... I need to find an excuse...)<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：I asked for a physical examination.</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：I got lost.</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mogador：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Heh... That's exactly what I thought.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''In that case...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mogador：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Allow me to do the honors. Heehee♥<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mogador：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Lost? Where were you going?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''I was going to get a physical check-up.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mogador：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Then you might as well do it here. I'll perform your physical checkup... Heehee♥<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
How do you expect to do that? There's no equipment here.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mogador：</span><br>
Haha... I don't need equipment♥ I know the latest and greatest examination method that requires no tools.<br>
She leans over me, her hot breaths caressing my neck.<br>
*sniff sniff*... It's called an olfactory examination.<br>
Ahh... God, yes... The smell of fresh sweat... *sniff sniff*...<br>
Your body's awfully stiff, though... Are you hurt?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
Nope.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mogador：</span><br>
*sniff sniff*... It's not nice to lie, Commander... Your smell tells the truth...<br>
You know what? I'm going to give you a full-body inspection... Hahhh♥<br>
Swiftly and dextrously, she runs her dainty fingers along my body. Those feverish eyes are swirling with lust and elation.<br>
Your clothes are in the way... Mine, too, actually! Let me just...♥<br>
With a rough, impatient motion, she starts pulling on my clothes.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
Mogador!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mogador：</span><br>
I try to pin her hands down, but she twists her body and evades my grip with no effort.<br>
Hahh, ahh... What a serious expression... Are you feeling nervous? Or embarrassed?<br>
Okay, I'll turn off the lights to help you calm down. Heehee♥<br>
Right as she said those words, all the lights in the room went out.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
......<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mogador：</span><br>
Huff... Puff...♥<br>
Her soft body covers me, and her feverish, hot breath tickles my ear.<br>
There we go... There's nothing to be embarrassed or nervous about... Nobody can see us in the darkness...<br>
Now let's continue the examination... Hahh♥<br>

{{折叠面板|标题=Heart-Throbbing Care|选项=3|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Franklin：</span><br>
Nurse Franklin stands by my bedside in a clean hospital room. She shifts her gaze from the patient records in her hand and onto me.<br>
So, Commander, any way I can help you?<br>
I hold my tongue for the moment and study her closely.<br>
Although she has the same composed smile as always, her body is strangely covered in a faint layer of sweat.<br>
CLUNK!<br>
Just then, the door in the back closes, and I even hear it lock up.<br>
Based on my experience thus far, that door won't be opening for a while.<br>
Looks like you've hurt your hand, huh?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：(Nod.)</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：It's no big deal. I'll tend to it myself.</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Franklin：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Alright. Let me patch you up, then.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Franklin：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''By yourself?<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''No, we can't do that. You have a nurse ready to help right here!<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''I wouldn't be doing my job if I let my patients treat their own wounds.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Franklin：</span><br>
A sensual undertone in her smile gradually deepens. Her eyes ooze with irrepressible yearning.<br>
What are you staring at?<br>
Come on, let me tend to your hand.<br>
She gazes at me with unabashed passion, the redness of her cheeks becoming increasingly evident.<br>
Phew... Is it just me, or is it hot in here?<br>
She loosens her collar and uses her hand to fan herself, as if trying to cool down.<br>
Settle down, me... Don't get impatient...♡<br>
Okay, let's see that hand. Nurse Franklin will take good care of you.<br>
First aid kit in hand, she crouches in front of me and leans against my knees. Her warmth seeps through the fabric.<br>
Then, she takes my hand and expertly tends to my wound, moving with swift precision but applying a jarring amount of force.<br>
The pain causes my fingers to stiffen.<br>
She clearly picks up on this small reaction and loosens her grip.<br>
Did that hurt?<br>
Sorry about that. I can be a little... careless sometimes.<br>
She looks up to meet my gaze. There is an inexplicable glimmer in her eyes.<br>
Next, I'll be more careful and gentle♡<br>
There we go... All done!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
Thank you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Franklin：</span><br>
No need to thank me. It's just the way we are with each other, isn't it?<br>
Having said that...<br>
She squeezes my hand with both of hers, pulls me up, and takes a sudden step forward to embrace me.<br>
Her sweaty, hot body sticks to me, and her hair graces my cheek, carrying her unique fragrance.<br>
If you really wanna thank me, can you do me a favor?<br>
My vision blurs all of a sudden. Before I know it, I'm on the bed after she's pushed me into it.<br>
It looks like she's sweating more than just a moment ago.<br>
I just... It feels like being close to you is the only way to release this heat inside of me...<br>
Come on... Come closer♡<br>

<br>
Late at night, I hear a sound behind the curtains in the corner of the room. Treading carefully, I come close and pull the curtains aside...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Washington：</span><br>
Commander?!<br>
For some reason, nurse Washington is behind them. Upon seeing me, a look of anticipation fills her eyes for a moment.<br>
You here to help with my clinical practice?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
Excuse me? Clinical practice?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Washington：</span><br>
Yeah, you heard me!<br>
Before I can say another word, she forcibly pulls me into bed, cutting the distance between us while I'm helpless to do anything.<br>
Alright, let's get started! Don't waste my time!<br>
First off, I'm gonna check your heartbeat!<br>
With those words, she picks up a stethoscope and reaches out to me.<br>
Or rather, she tries to, but the tube gets caught on the string of her top.<br>
Buh?!<br>
Surprised by the tug on her clothes, she lets out a small cry.<br>
The fabric is stretched, and her already tight clothes leave an imprint on her body.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：You okay?</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：Need a hand?</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Washington：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''I-I'm fine! Just got caught off guard, that's all!<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Playing it cool, she tries to untangle the tube from her clothes. Owing to her nerves, it doesn't go so well.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Washington：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''I'm fine! I can handle this myself!<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''With a confident look, she tries hard to get the tube loose. However, her nervousness only makes things worse for her.<br>
It's not long before the exertion starts to paint her exposed skin a pinkish red.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：(Lend her a hand.)</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Washington：</span><br>
I come closer and take the stethoscope out of her hand.<br>
Look, I can... Eh, whatever.<br>
If you wanna help so badly, you do it, then!<br>
She lets go and hands the reins over to me.<br>
I manage to untangle the tube from her clothes in no time.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
There you go.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Washington：</span><br>
Thanks...<br>
With flushed cheeks, she thanks me in a hushed, embarrassed voice. Then, she furrows her brow and raises her voice.<br>
Alright! Let's forget that little accident happened and get on with the practice!<br>
You're my patient, so act like it – lie down!<br>
She rapidly comes closer and pushes me into the bed again.<br>
This practice has just gotten started, you hear...<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suzuya：</span><br>
Well, dear patient...<br>
Or perhaps I should call you "Detective"?<br>
Whatever the case, you've been investigating me, haven't you?<br>
<br>
Suzuya lies sprawled lazily on the bed, her lips curving into a vague smile.<br>
As for myself, I've been restrained tightly to the bed with straps, unable to move a single muscle.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：I just want to learn the truth about this hospital.</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：You've got it wrong! I'm not your enemy!</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suzuya：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''The truth, you say...<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''You're searching for something you don't need to know. If you want to make better use of your time...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suzuya：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Is that so? You don't get to decide whether I'm your ally or not, Detective.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''If I were you, I'd focus on something more important than our relation to one another.<br>
<br>
She takes the syringe in her hands and slowly lifts it up to her lips. The liquid inside of it is red and gives off a beguiling light.<br>
Running the tip of the needle along her tongue, she reaches toward my knee with her free hand and strokes it gently.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suzuya：</span><br>
Guess what's inside this syringe. What do you think will happen if I inject you with it?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：......</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：Some kind of lethal drug?</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suzuya：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Cat got your tongue, hmm?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suzuya：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Bzzzt. Incorrect, I'm afraid.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suzuya：</span><br>
If you really don't know, then why don't we test it and find out?<br>
<br>
She leans forward a bit and closes the distance between us. The light in her eyes grows brighter.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suzuya：</span><br>
Oh dear, your body is quite stiff.<br>
Are you afraid? Heehee.<br>
<br>
She gently shakes the syringe. The cold gleam off its surface makes me squint.<br>
The expected sting of the needle never comes; instead, I feel the softness of Suzuya's touch.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suzuya：</span><br>
Please rest assured, I would never use any drugs on you.<br>
Nor will I hurt you in any way.<br>
<br>
She puts the syringe aside and straddles me.<br>
A soft sensation graces my knees, and she speaks to me with a tone indicative of worry and helplessness.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suzuya：</span><br>
However, if I don't, I won't be able to leave work for today...<br>
For you see, it's my job to provide treatment.<br>
<br>
She runs her fingers over my skin without reserve.<br>
As she moves, the temperature in the room seems to rise slightly, as though the warmth of her body seeps through her fingertips and spreads through the air.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suzuya：</span><br>
Oh, I just had a wonderful idea. Perhaps we could...<br>
<br>
I turn my head up and meet her gaze.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suzuya：</span><br>
Try it a different way, hmm~?<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Voroshilov：</span><br>
Mmh...<br>
Voroshilov, lying on the sickbed, slowly opens her eyes. She vacantly surveys her surroundings before finally fixing her gaze on me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
Had a good rest?<br>
You passed out all of a sudden earlier, so I laid you down here to rest.<br>
I did a quick check, and I couldn't find anything physically wrong with you. However...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Voroshilov：</span><br>
I see...<br>
Listlessly, she stretches her arms, seemingly unfazed by what I just said.<br>
The midday sunlight coming through the window casts her shadow. It feels like an uneventful, calm early afternoon.<br>
Heehee...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
Hm?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Voroshilov：</span><br>
Just as I walk closer to speak to her, my body suddenly refuses to obey me.<br>
That's when I realize that she was only pretending to fall unconscious. It was a trap to get me to lower my guard.<br>
Sorry, Detective, you're just too shrewd.<br>
I wouldn't be able to restrain you without resorting to dirty tricks like this.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：What did you do to me?</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Voroshilov：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''That's what you're worried about?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：I don't mean you any harm. Maybe we can work together.</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''She scoffs at me, clearly unwilling to engage in any conversation about this.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Say what you wish. Right now, you're mine.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''As she says that, she leans against me and swiftly lays my collar bare.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''It's only then that I notice she has a stethoscope in her hand.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Voroshilov... What are you going to do?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Voroshilov：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Beneath those detached eyes lies a faint smile.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''There are many, many things a nurse can do to their patient.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''She looks at my motionless body and into my eyes, a hint of mischief in her expression.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''For instance...<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''The cold head of her stethoscope touches my chest, sending a shiver through me.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Bear with it. It only feels cold in the beginning.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''The emotion concealed in her eyes is as intense as the color of red wine – I feel like I'll lose myself in them.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''It'll warm up soon. As will you... and I.<br>

<br>
Lying down in my clean and comfy bed, I let the waves of fatigue wash over me, my eyelids getting heavier and heavier.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">？？？：</span><br>
Here we go...<br>
<br>
There is a mutter, and my bed shakes slightly.<br>
I open my eyes and turn in the sound's direction.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Santa Fe：</span><br>
Nyahaha... Still up, Detective?<br>
<br>
Santa Fe freezes in the position she snuck into bed with. She has the awkward look of a criminal caught red-handed.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I was asleep until you woke me up.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Santa Fe：</span><br>
Ohh... Sorry! I wasn't trying to, honestly!<br>
Let me make it up to you by... sleeping right beside you! Nyahaha!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
You were going to do that anyway, weren't you?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Santa Fe：</span><br>
Uhh, the thing is... This place is just so creepy that I'm terrified to sleep by myself!<br>
So I came to you!<br>
It's sooo reassuring when you're with me, so I think I'll sleep like a log by your side!<br>
Pleeease! Don't send me away, O great and almighty Detective!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Well, since you're already here, just stay.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Santa Fe：</span><br>
Yay! You're the best! Nyahaha!<br>
<br>
Having received my permission, the tension in her eyes fades away, replaced by a carefree smile.<br>
She hugs her pillow tightly and sits on the bed, eyes blinking and looking at me.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
What's the matter? Aren't you going to sleep?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Santa Fe：</span><br>
Heehee♪<br>
<br>
Planting both her hands on the bed, Santa Fe adopts a mysterious air as she begins to whisper to me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Santa Fe：</span><br>
I'll bet you know all kinds of juicy gossip, Detective!<br>
Can you tell me something? You know... as a bedtime story!<br>
C'mooon, don't make that face! I promise I won't tell anyone.<br>
<br>
THUD!<br>
All of a sudden, a muffled noise sounds from outside the room.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Santa Fe：</span><br>
Eeek! Help me, Detective!<br>
<br>
She leaps like a startled cat and throws herself into my chest, gripping my collar tightly.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Hey, don't be scared. I'll go and have a look. You stay here.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Santa Fe：</span><br>
W-wait! It always goes badly for people in movies when they go off on their own like this!<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：I'm the main character. I'll be fine.</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Santa Fe：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''You... sound strangely convincing when you put it like that.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Wait... If you're the MC, wouldn't it put me in danger if you left me behind?!<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''I-I'll come with you!<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''She hurriedly rises to her feet, wrapping her arms around one of mine.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Santa Fe：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Okay, let's go!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Santa Fe：</span><br>
Phew... So that's all it was! The blackboard just fell off the wall!<br>
<br>
After seeing that nothing of note happened in the corridor, we both returned to the hospital room.<br>
While Santa Fe sounds nonchalant in tone, she hasn't let go of my arm in the slightest.<br>
As soon as I get into bed, she leaps into my chest again. She is still trembling slightly.<br>
A while later, she finally manages to calm down and relaxes her shoulders.<br>
By which I mean, she is back to being cocky again.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Santa Fe：</span><br>
Hmm... I'm bored.<br>
Since you won't share any gossip with me, I'll tell you some that I know!<br>
Ready? You better strap in, 'cause it's a long one!<br>
<br>
She tightly buries her face in my arms and snickers to herself.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Santa Fe：</span><br>
Ready or not, we have the whole night ahead of us, pal! Nyahaha!<br>

<br>
I arrive at the room Miller has been confined to and look around the area. Then, suddenly...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">？？？：</span><br>
Partneeer!<br>
<br>
A sweet, bouncy voice rings out from overhead.<br>
I lift my gaze, and there she is – Miller lands right in front of me, suspended upside-down.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Miller：</span><br>
How'd you like the GOAT's entry, huh? Pretty awesome, I dare say! I'm... Whoa, whoa, whoa!<br>
<br>
Her proud parade is rained on as the very next moment, she starts spinning around in the air.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Careful! Here, take hold of my shoulders!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Miller：</span><br>
Hahaha! The GOAT is used to this! I could handle it in my sleep!<br>
But, if you insist, I suppose I'll oblige!<br>
<br>
She puts her squishy paws on my shoulders and manages to stabilize herself.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Okay, now we need to get you out of those shackles.<br>
<br>
I scan the area, searching for a key or a tool that can break through the chains.<br>
After some time, I realize that Miller's gaze is completely fixated on my face.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
What? Is something wrong?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Miller：</span><br>
No. It's nothing...<br>
<br>
She mutters a response, then – taking care not to cut me with her sharp claws – wraps her arms around my shoulders, giving me a gentle embrace.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Miller：</span><br>
I just wanted to hug you...<br>
<br>
The distance separating us silently vanishes in a sweet warmth.<br>
Then, there is a click – the shackles on her feet come undone.<br>
I quickly catch her as she falls down, holding the little girl tightly in my arms.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
You already knew how to get it off?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Miller：</span><br>
Yup! Just had to follow the chain to find it! Piece of cake when you're GOATed like me!<br>
Well, not exactly. I managed to open it right when you got here.<br>
Stuff like this is why we make such a good team!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
You could've told me sooner.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Miller：</span><br>
But that's lame. It's much more majestic to descend from above! Makes you pay more attention to me, too!<br>
<br>
She rubs her cheek against mine. It's soft and warm, although her fluffy hair tickles a little.<br>
Then, with the lightness of a feather, she gives me a small kiss.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Miller：</span><br>
Thanks for coming to save me, partner!<br>

<br>
Arriving at the agreed-upon location, I push open the door.<br>
On the other side is a brightly lit room, adorably decorated with stuffed animals everywhere you look. The atmosphere is strikingly different from any other room in the hospital.<br>
Surrounded by plushies, the "little rabbit" looks at me with a satisfied smile.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Halford：</span><br>
Right on time.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：A promise is a promise.</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：Are you having a party in here?</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Halford：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''For a moment, Halford's expression is one of joy, but she quickly neutralizes her smile, leaving only the blush on her cheeks.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Go on, take a seat!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Halford：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''That I am. Go on, take a seat!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Halford：</span><br>
Doing as told, I sit down on the empty couch next to her.<br>
Ahem... If you'd rather sit beside me, feel free to... um...<br>
Halford glances at the couch I'm sitting on, hesitates for a moment, then shifts her gaze and changes the subject entirely.<br>
What I mean to say is... how do you like the party?<br>
From this attire to these stuffed animals, I arranged it all for you.<br>
I thought you'd find it relaxing to be surrounded by such cute things... It is for me, at least...<br>
So, I hope you'll be able to unwind in here.<br>
All this running around the hospital ever since we joined forces has surely been exhausting, no?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
Thanks for arranging a party just for me. I'm moved, truly.<br>
Why didn't you ask anyone else for help? You've been just as busy as me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Halford：</span><br>
I couldn't with peace of mind entrust others with the task of organizing a party for you.<br>
Besides, if they knew about it, they'd gather here in droves.<br>
Then you wouldn't be able to relax – they'd just wear you out even more.<br>
Having said that, if it's a more lively atmosphere you want, I can summon some friends.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：I have everything I need right here.</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：You being here is all I need.</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''It must've been a lot of work setting all this up.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Halford：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''It was nothing. Need I remind you I'm the lord of the bloodkin, with eternal power? Fatigue is a foreign concept to me.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''You'd know no hardship either if you'd only become a member of my clan.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''I give her a smile in lieu of an answer.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''But enough about that. Rest and recuperate now.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''I'm so glad to have you, Halford.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Halford：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Huh? What's this all of a sudden?<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''I'm not going anywhere if that's what you think. Just concentrate on relaxing, you!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Halford：</span><br>
I reply with a nod, then relax my shoulders and sink into the couch.<br>
Now that I can breathe easy, all the fatigue catches up to me at once, making me sleepy.<br>
Are you going to have a nap?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
Yeah... I could get some shut-eye.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Halford：</span><br>
In that case...<br>
Bashfully, she clings to her Dora plushie, her cheeks turning red.<br>
...Why don't you rest your head in my lap? It's more comfortable...<br>
She finally musters the courage to beckon me closer, and from that point on, her speech becomes more fluid.<br>
Since we've decided you're going to rest, we must aim for the best rest you can get, no?<br>
Now, come. You'd be wise to accept this honor offered by the lord of the bloodkin!<br>

{{折叠面板|标题=The Noble Fox's Feast|选项=10|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Ah, you've come. Then let us begin the feast.<br>
Allow me to congratulate you on becoming the board chairman of Valley Hospital, {playername}.<br>
The bright, spacious hall is adorned with striking decorations, shining with a gorgeous light.<br>
Akagi, who shares control of the hospital with me, leans gracefully against the high backrest of her chair, exuding a leisurely yet refined aura.<br>
If I have one issue with this feast, it's that it's just a bit too quiet.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
Is it just us here?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Why, yes, of course it's just us. Heehee.<br>
Are you saying that you wished someone else would've come?<br>
Above her sweetly curved lips is a pair of eyes filled with unmistakable possessiveness.<br>
Now, come to me, please. Let us drink the night away.<br>
Lifting one hand, she provocatively curls up a fair, supple finger, beckoning me.<br>
Spurred on, I take a seat right next to her, and she hands me her half-full glass of clear, high-quality drink.<br>
Its texture is velvety, and its taste, utterly delectable. Won't you have a little, to start with?<br>
After all, it will be a little while longer before the dinner is ready.<br>
On the rim of the beautiful glass is attached a soft imprint – that of her lips.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：(Accept her offer.)</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：(Accept, but reluctantly.)</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''I take the glass from her and drink along the imprint of her lips, downing it all at once.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''How daring of you, my esteemed chairman... Heehee.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''You shouldn't be afraid to take a more direct approach to relieving boredom, right?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''I take the glass from her and drink from a spot her lips haven't touched, downing it all at once.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''My, my, esteemed chairman, is there still something holding you back? Heehee.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''We can't have any moderation tonight. For you see, what comes next... Heehee.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
As soon as she finishes speaking, it feels like someone is touching my calf.<br>
Looking down, I see the red string wrapped around her ankle is brushing against my calf.<br>
Then, with a clear jingle from the accessories adorning her body, she stands up.<br>
She cuts the distance between us with easy steps, then bends forward before me and looks right into my eyes.<br>
The many tails behind her quickly wrap around my body, pulling me closer without any regard for my consent.<br>
The subduedly sweet aroma of the drink mingles with Akagi's own scent, as her warm breath tickles my ear.<br>
Close your eyes... and enjoy this feast for just you and I♡<br>

Letters from Valley Hospital<br>
<br>
11 Epilogue<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Franklin：</span><br>
Congrats on making it to the end, "ace detective!"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Halford：</span><br>
The ending where the bloodkin's glory is restored was quite excellent.<br>
Speaking as the screenwriter, I'm very pleased that you all managed to perfectly replicate the story and setting I imagined.<br>
Commander, you worked hardest of all. Come out and accept your praise!<br>
<br>
As though that was the signal, an invisible curtain falls and all the "actors" who had left the scene returned one by one onto the stage.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Miller：</span><br>
Been waiting for you, Commander! So, how'd you like the GOAT's acting? Pretty awesome, eh?<br>
A-and obviously I didn't train at all, outside of the expected practice with the other actors!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Stremitelny ：</span><br>
Yeah, I can vouch for her! Because I sure as heck didn't see her practicing how to use a sling in front of a mirror at 3 in the morning!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Franklin：</span><br>
Even though this was my first time doing an event like this, I can say it's got the same kind of thrill as a good adventure.<br>
It's a shame I never got to use my stuff, though. Like my first aid kits, multitools, mountaineering ropes, or waterproof tent...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Washington：</span><br>
The fact they never saw any use is a good thing, honestly.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Voroshilov：</span><br>
Well, they would've been handy to have if we got shipwrecked while on the yacht. It's a pity that wasn't part of the script.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Halford：</span><br>
The reason for that is because the voyage was immediately before the end!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mogador：</span><br>
*sigh*... It's already over. Bummer.<br>
I barely got to spend any time with the Commander...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Halford：</span><br>
Really? I'd say you got to spend plenty of time.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mogador & Suzuya：</span><br>
- You just don't get it!  - You don't understand.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Voroshilov & Akagi：</span><br>
- She's right. - Agreed.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Halford：</span><br>
Excuse me?<br>
I don't... understand?<br>
But... it was I who wrote the script!<br>
