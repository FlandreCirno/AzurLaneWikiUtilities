Heart in the Right Place<br>
<br>
1 The Day After the Storm<br>
It was a windy night. A tremendous storm swept across the port.<br>
As I lied down in bed, I knew the next day would be spent assessing and repairing the damage from the storm. I fell asleep to the noise of raindrops banging on the window.<br>
I woke up at dawn and went for a look outside.<br>
While I was inspecting a building, a familiar face approached me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shigure：</span><br>
Well, look who it is. What are you doing? Watching paint dry?<br>
...Assessing the damage? Really? And I'm supposed to believe you're not just making excuses for standing around, wasting time?<br>
<br>
There was much on my mind, and only when she pointed it out did I notice I'd thoughtlessly walked to the Sakura Empire's dormitory.<br>
I raised my head to take a proper look, and much to my surprise, the building was completely unscathed.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shigure：</span><br>
Of course it is! My luck just won't allow any damage to come to the place I live. Especially not some stupid smalltime storm!<br>
<br>
Indeed, her luck was extraordinary. However, she wasn't the sole lucky inhabitant of this dorm – Yukikaze lives here, too.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shigure：</span><br>
...You just thought about Yukikaze, didn't you? You are SO wrong if you think she had anything to do with it!<br>
It was all thanks to MY luck! Got that? Heck, she might as well not even have existed!<br>
Hmph! I'm not handing the win to that stupid cat... Maybe I'll settle for a tie... Wait, no I won't! I'm the winner here, duh!<br>
<br>
A battle raged inside of Shigure. A battle I felt it was best not to involve myself in.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shigure：</span><br>
...I just remembered something. Tell you what, come along. We need to see how Yamashiro's shrine fared after the storm.<br>
<br>
She raised a good point. The shrine, unlike the dormitory, was not built with extreme weather accounted for.<br>
Furthermore, the shrine was surrounded by a thick grove. It was very likely it had been damaged during the storm.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shigure：</span><br>
So, are you coming or not? I don't have all day, you know!<br>
<br>
And so, I agreed to accompany her to the shrine and assess the damage.<br>

2 To Yamashiro's Aid<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shigure：</span><br>
Oh no... This is even worse than I thought.<br>
<br>
Indeed, the place was in a terrible state. The footpath leading up to the shrine was buried beneath branches and leaves.<br>
There was at least a silver lining – the path was not blocked by toppled trees.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shigure：</span><br>
Yamashiro! Fusou! Are you all right?!<br>
<br>
Seeing what happened to the footpath prompted Shigure to run up and check on the shrine itself.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yamashiro：</span><br>
Shigure? Milord, too?!<br>
<br>
Yamashiro was sweeping the yard with a broomstick, trying to clear up the debris.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shigure：</span><br>
Phew, thank god you're all right... Where's Fusou?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yamashiro：</span><br>
She's just by the shrine, cleaning up some trash that flew in. Now, Milord, why are you here?<br>
<br>
"I'm going around the port and doing damage assessment. Shigure told me to come along."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yamashiro：</span><br>
I see... Then would you mind helping us out here? There's a lot of leaves, trash, and stuff we need to clear out.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shigure：</span><br>
Of cooourse! Right, Commander? I mean, you wouldn't refuse me if I asked you to do it, would you?<br>
<br>
They needed help, and it had to be done eventually anyway. I told them yes.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yamashiro：</span><br>
Great! Thank you both so much! I'll go find you a broom and a trash bag!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shigure：</span><br>
Sure. Just to make sure right off the bat: where should we even start?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yamashiro：</span><br>
Fusou's handling the shrine, and I've got the yard covered, so you could start by sweeping the footpath.<br>
Let me go get what you need, I'll be right ba– Aaaack?!<br>
<br>
Yamashiro turned around to go back to the shrine, and immediately tripped on the hanging sleeve of her own kimono.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shigure：</span><br>
I've got you!<br>
<br>
Before she could actually fall over, Shigure jumped in and grabbed her hand. She was so fast, it's like she predicted this would happen.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shigure：</span><br>
You okay?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yamashiro：</span><br>
Y-yeah, I'm okay! Thanks. You know how clumsy I can be...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shigure：</span><br>
...Yeah, what, Commander? Like she just said, she's known to slip up, sometimes literally. I saw it coming, that's all.<br>
<br>
They have been friends a long time, so it wasn't really surprising how her save was so perfect.<br>
With that minor accident prevented, she retrieved the brooms for us and we started sweeping the footpath.<br>

3 Sweep 'n' Skip<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yuudachi：</span><br>
Woof! You needed a hand, so here I am!<br>
<br>
We decided it was best to get some extra help, so Shigure went and convinced Yuudachi to join us.<br>
Her other sisters had their hands full, and Shiratsuyu was likely to get lost on the way, so the task of sweeping the footpath fell on just us three.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shigure：</span><br>
All right, Commander, you start from the shrine and work towards the first torii gate. That good with you? Good.<br>
Me and Yuudachi will do the opposite, and we'll meet you halfway. We'll be like a two-sided progress bar!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yuudachi：</span><br>
Forgot to ask, but what's in it for me with all this? I'm not a janny, I don't work for free!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shigure：</span><br>
I know, quit barking at me. I'll make you a steak, if you actually stick around. Anyhow, see you in the middle, Commander.<br>
<br>
Shigure and Yuudachi went down the path. I picked up my broom and started sweeping.<br>
I swept for quite some time, but still there was no sign of Shigure and Yuudachi. We should've met in the middle by now...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shigure：</span><br>
Stupid, dumb meat junkie! Where are you?!<br>
<br>
Suddenly, I heard Shigure yell out. I looked up and saw her off the footpath and in the grove.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shigure：</span><br>
Oh! Commander! You seen Yuudachi anywhere?<br>
It was going fine until she shouted something about "Ooh, free-range steak spotted!" and she just ran off! I can't believe this crap!<br>
I TOLD her I'd treat her to food if she'd just help me sweep! Ugh... I know we're not done yet, but can you help me look for her?<br>
<br>
Knowing Yuudachi, the promise of a steak prepared by Shigure – as delicious as it would be – would not be enough to stop her from getting distracted.<br>
Seeing as it had to be done, I put down my broom and went off to look for her. But immediately, Shigure chided me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shigure：</span><br>
Hey! Where are you going?! I said help me find her, as in "follow me!" Get it together, Commander!<br>
...We can cover more ground if we split up? Sound idea on paper, but this is a stupid runaway dog we're talking about.<br>
Also, what if you pull a Shiratsuyu and get lost in this place? I do NOT wanna spend the day looking for TWO people!<br>
<br>
I felt she was overthinking it, but since she insisted on it...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shigure：</span><br>
That's a good commander! Now do as the genius tells you and follow along!<br>
<br>
I complied, returning to her side. We went looking for Yuudachi together.<br>

4 Be Mindful Around the Green<br>
Unable to find Yuudachi, we went back to the yard. There, we saw Yamashiro and Fusou wave at us from over by the shrine.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fusou：</span><br>
Wonderful work, you two. I just brewed some tea, so how about we take a short break from all the cleaning?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shigure：</span><br>
Yes, let's. By the way, have either of you seen Yuudachi? She was supposed to help with the sweeping, 'til she up and vanished on me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fusou：</span><br>
Yuudachi? Hmm... No, I don't believe I have. Sorry.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shigure：</span><br>
For the love of... That moron's gonna pay for this. With her dinner!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yamashiro：</span><br>
Now, now, let's not get too worked up! Here, have some tea. You too, Milord~<br>
<br>
I took up on their offer and accepted the cup of tea. My eyes casually glanced over at the shrine office to the side, where I saw a myriad of charms and talismans on display.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fusou：</span><br>
You may be surprised to know that we get visitors from not just the Sakura Empire, but every other faction as well, who come to pay their respects.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shigure：</span><br>
What's that hexagonal box thingie over there?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fusou：</span><br>
Oh, that? It's our fortune slip box. You shake it around, then out comes a stick with a number written on it.<br>
<br>
Curious to see for herself, Shigure shook the box. The fortune she received was – astoundingly – "supreme luck."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shigure：</span><br>
Heheheh... Watch this, Commander. I'll prove that I'm the luckiest lucky ship that ever lucked into this port!<br>
<br>
She shook the box again, and again, and again. When she finished, she had received that same fortune a whole five times in a row.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shigure：</span><br>
Do you want to give it a try, Yamashiro?<br>
If I stand right next to you, you'll probably get a big luck boost!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yamashiro：</span><br>
You really think so? I've... never gotten much of a positive result with this thing. But why not, I suppose?<br>
<br>
Yamashiro picked up the box, gave it a gentle shake, and out came a fortune – regular luck.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shigure：</span><br>
Huh... There's something else written on the fortune slip. "Be mindful around the green."<br>
Leaves are green, so you should probably watch out around those. You could slip, or something.<br>
...Oh no.<br>
<br>
Shigure's attention was suddenly drawn to the teacup in Yamashiro's hand.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shigure：</span><br>
Wait, Yamashiro! Let it cool before–<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yamashiro：</span><br>
Oww! Hot! Hot!<br>
<br>
Yamashiro tilted her head back to drink from the teacup. The next moment, she cringed in pain, lowered the teacup, and stuck her tongue out.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yamashiro：</span><br>
Aww... I think I just burned my tongue. As it turns out, this is green tea... Errph...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shigure：</span><br>
...Well, if there's one thing this proves it's that there's limits to what even my luck can do.<br>
<br>
Even Shigure's aura of supreme luck could not prevent misfortune from striking the accident-prone Yamashiro.<br>

5 Inside Shigure's Mind<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shigure：</span><br>
Breaktime's over, Commander. We've still got to find that dumb dog!<br>
<br>
Shigure was right. The sun would set before long if we didn't find her. We gave our thanks to Yamashiro and Fusou, then resumed our search.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shigure：</span><br>
Boy, I'm glad we stopped to have a break just for that tea! It was so good.<br>
<br>
"You must really respect Yamashiro and Fusou, based on how you talk to them."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shigure：</span><br>
...Well, yeah? Stunning deduction there, Sherlock. Of course I respect them!<br>
Yamashiro always has everyone's best on her mind. That's why she's a klutz, she thinks about everyone else before herself!<br>
She's like Mogami and Michishio, you know? They all go to such lengths for their friends!<br>
<br>
She sang her friends' praises before then tooting her own horn.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shigure：</span><br>
I'm following the example they're setting, going out of my way to look after some people you just can't leave to their own devices.<br>
Like you, Commander. You hate being lonely, don't you? Which is why I'm even giving you the time of day! And I expect at least a "thank you" for it!<br>
<br>
Even though she prompted me to do it, I did feel grateful towards her. I said my thanks, after which she turned around, satisfied, and started walking again.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shigure：</span><br>
All right, we'll look by the torii gates over there this time! If your feet start hurting or whatever, just say it and we'll stop for a minute. Got that?<br>
<br>
She showed a surprising amount of consideration for me. I looked at her and suddenly remembered what she said when I suggested splitting up into two groups.<br>
That's when I had a realization. Shigure simply didn't want to be alone.<br>
I saw a glimpse of that through our conversation just now. I felt I'd gotten a little closer to understanding Shigure's true feelings.<br>

6 The Surprise Behind the Door<br>
We searched and searched until we arrived at the first torii gate, still without a single trace of Yuudachi.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shigure：</span><br>
I'm starting to think she just got bored and went back to the dorm. I mean, we've looked everywhere!<br>
...Lost in the woods? Nuh-uh, no chance. Yuudachi's sixth sense doesn't allow her to get lost.<br>
Her gut is like a compass that points home, where the T-bones are, when she gets hungry. Worst case scenario is she went back, found the meat freezer empty, and went ballistic as a result.<br>
Forget about her, we've wasted enough time. Let's get sweeping again and wrap this thing up.<br>
<br>
I accepted Shigure's theory. We picked up our brooms and resumed where we left off. Some time later...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shigure：</span><br>
Whew... All right, I think we've cleaned up enough.<br>
Honestly, I'd be fine just staying at the shrine and protecting it with my luck. Yukikaze can have the dorm, or whatever.<br>
We arrived before the shed, the interior of which we'd left for last.<br>
Okay, home stretch right here! The door should be unlocked, so let's see what we've got.<br>
<br>
She put her hand on the side of the sliding door.<br>
That same moment, a rattle rang out from inside the shed.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shigure：</span><br>
Eek! Wh-what the hell was that noise?!<br>
<br>
Shigure was frightened, and began coming up with explanations for the noise.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shigure：</span><br>
It wasn't a ghost, was it?! Maybe there's a rat inside... Not that that's much better than a ghost, but still!<br>
<br>
We stuck our ears against the door, but didn't hear any other noises. One thing was for sure: that rattle was definitely not just our imaginations.<br>
Shigure was breathing rapidly and nervously. I grabbed hold of her hand, thinking it would calm her nerves.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shigure：</span><br>
What the–?! What do you think you're doing?!<br>
<br>
It had the opposite effect, making her more agitated instead. She warmed up to it quickly, however.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shigure：</span><br>
Well... I don't have to worry about you getting scared and running off this way. Fine, I'll hold your hand!<br>
Anyway, we can't put this off just because of some spooky noise. I'll open the door on the count of three. Ready?<br>
<br>
She again put her free hand on the door, holding mine with the other.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shigure：</span><br>
One... Two... Three!<br>
<br>
The door slid open in one go. What we found inside was neither ghost nor rat.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yuudachi：</span><br>
Zzz... Mrmh... Steak as far as the eye can see... I'm in heavennn... Zzz...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shigure：</span><br>
Yuudachi?! Were you seriously in here all this time?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yuudachi：</span><br>
Mrrmh... Hmm? What's up, Shigure? Is it dinnertime yet? *yaaawn*...<br>
I was sweeping this place when I suddenly got all tired. When you've gotta nap, you gotta nap, you know?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shigure：</span><br>
I'm too stunned to even get mad at you. *sigh*... What's a girl to do with you...<br>
<br>
Flabbergasted, Shigure fell flat on her butt. She sighed while bemoaning all the wasted effort we expended to find Yuudachi.<br>

7 Moving Forward with Shigure<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shigure：</span><br>
*sigh*... I feel dead exhausted all of a sudden.<br>
<br>
With Yuudachi finally found, we went back to the yard. Shigure hung her shoulders and groaned under her breath.<br>
This whole ordeal took much more work and time than I had anticipated. What's more, I felt she was genuinely afraid before I held her hand just earlier.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shigure：</span><br>
Why the weary face, Commander? Are you really that tired? And look at your collar, it's all wrinkled and bent.<br>
You're just as beat as I am, but you still took the effort to try and calm me down back there, didn't you?<br>
Geez... You really didn't need to push yourself.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yuudachi：</span><br>
...Why are you red in the face? Got a fever or something?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shigure：</span><br>
Shuddup! Stick to fantasizing about shoving meat down your gullet!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yuudachi：</span><br>
What? Did I say somethin' to tick you off? Chill.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yamashiro：</span><br>
Fusou! They're back! And look, they even found Yuudachi! Nice work, everyone~!<br>
<br>
Port - Office<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shigure：</span><br>
Hey, Commander, got a moment?<br>
<br>
I was flipping through stacks of paperwork when Shigure suddenly spoke to me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shigure：</span><br>
So... I heard you're looking for someone to serve as your secretary. You know, from gossip around the dorm.<br>
If – and let me stress this, IF – I volunteered for it, I-I think I'd be really useful around the office!<br>
It'd just be a waste of a position if anyone less dependable than me ended up being a burden when you get tired at work... You know?<br>
So, um... If I hand in my application, could you give it some thought?<br>
<br>
"It's funny you mention that, because the reason I assigned this work to you was to see how you'd perform."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shigure：</span><br>
——！！<br>
<br>
She looked away to hide her embarrassment, but the blush on her face was clear as day anyway.<br>
She was happy I put her to this test. I couldn't help but crack a smile from her reaction.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shigure：</span><br>
R-really, huh? Go figure! Passed with flying colors, didn't I?<br>
<br>
She regained her cool and faced me again. She spoke to me in her regular assertive tone.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shigure：</span><br>
I suppose that means I'll be watching you every day from now on, making sure you don't do anything dumb! Sounds cushy~<br>
<br>
As overconfident as she tended to be, I had no doubt she would live up to my expectations and then some.<br>
In that moment, I felt very lucky to have a dependable, considerate girl like Shigure as my secretary.<br>
