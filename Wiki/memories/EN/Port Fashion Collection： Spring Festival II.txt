Port Fashion Collection: Spring Festival II<br>
<br>
1 Fireworks Adorn the Night Sky<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Albion：</span><br>
"A thousand flowers bloom in the wake of the Eastern wind."<br>
"Petals fall as a shower of stars, their aroma left in the trails of carriages passing through."<br>
"The flutes composed, the moonlight bright. Fireworks adorn the night sky, leaping like carp on a waterfall."<br>
<br>
A silver-haired girl lingers on the veranda and quietly recites a poem to herself.<br>
Her sheer dress dances in the night breeze, and the lights blend into the dark of night, but they pale before her radiance.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Albion：</span><br>
Commander... You've been quiet for a while now. Is something wrong?<br>
Did I... make a mistake in my poetry reading?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
That's not it. I'm just worried that I'll ruin the beautiful view if I speak.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Albion：</span><br>
B-beautiful...<br>
Well, thank you for that...<br>
<br>
Albion looks down just slightly and thanks me.<br>
Despite being the one who invited me here, she's awfully nervous.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Albion：</span><br>
Are you not bored here, or anything...?<br>
If you are... you could, say, wander around the city.<br>
It's lively there, a-and there's much more fun to be had...<br>
<br>
Albion tries her hardest to come up with something, only becoming more nervous in the process. I should console her somehow.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
You were reciting a Dragon Empery poem, weren't you?<br>
What made you pick that one? Is there a special reason?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Albion：</span><br>
Oh, Hai Tien taught me this poem.<br>
If we ever got a moment alone together tonight...<br>
I was thinking I'd recite it with the resplendent night sky at my back, or...<br>
But... Hai Tien says there's a second half to the poem.<br>
I was hoping to spice up the conversation by having you teach me the rest...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Hai Tien?)<br>
Ahem... Do you know what the poem means?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Albion：</span><br>
Well... Not exactly...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
How about you try guessing?<br>
Words can display emotion. Even if you don't know the origin or background, you should be able to read between the lines a bit.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Albion：</span><br>
Umm... The text makes it sound like a bustling city. I think it's describing a festival, or something.<br>
The vibrant city is backed by a night sky adorned with fireworks...<br>
Colorful lanterns, folks enjoying a night on the town...<br>
...It sounds a lot like the port right now, heehee.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Sounds like you understand it perfectly. Okay, the second half is...<br>
"Decorated beauties, like golden thread hanging from the snow willow. Laughter and chatter pass by, leaving only a scent behind."<br>
"A hundred, thousand searches later, I look back. Beyond the lantern lights, there she is."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Albion：</span><br>
How pretty...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Yeah. It's a great poem.<br>
What do you think now that you've heard the rest?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Albion：</span><br>
I can feel the author's heart wavering...<br>
The laughter and joy in the poem are so far removed from them...<br>
They search single-mindedly for a certain someone, but they come up short...<br>
When they finally turn around, in the dim light, they finally find that someone...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
That's a lot like how I feel right now. Hahaha!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Albion：</span><br>
C-Commander...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Well? Do you still want me to go wander around the city?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Albion：</span><br>
N-no... I think I'd like you to stay here with me, if that's okay.<br>
The city may be vibrant, but there's a certain atmosphere to here and now.<br>
Besides... The flowers just outside the veranda are in full bloom.<br>
And the tea inside has the perfect aroma...<br>
Here, Commander. Have some tea.<br>
Why don't we let it mark a fresh start to our night together?<br>

<br>
2 Spring's Lackadaisical Leisure<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">???：</span><br>
Commander, are you awake?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Mmnh...<br>
Where am I...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Perseus ：</span><br>
There you go. Finally.<br>
You're like a hungry little birdie today, Commander.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
...Perseus? Why are you next to me...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Perseus ：</span><br>
You really forgot, Commander? Geez.<br>
This morning, you came to give me a New Year's gift...<br>
The outfit I'm wearing, y'know.<br>
When I finished changing and came back, I saw a certain lazybones asleep in my bed.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
.........<br>
<br>
My sleepy brain finally starts working. Now that she mentions it... that does seem to be the case.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：I'm sorry!</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：Sorry for using your bed without permission!</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Perseus ：</span><br>
It's fine. You don't have to apologize.<br>
There's nothing wrong with being a little lazy on such a nice day.<br>
<br>
She makes a fair point. One thing still doesn't make sense, though.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
And why are you lying next to me?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Perseus ：</span><br>
Me?<br>
To be a sleeping worm, of course.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
A... sleeping worm?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Perseus ：</span><br>
Yep. If you're done asking questions, I'm going back to sleep...<br>
As for the New Year stuff you were talking about before... We can talk about that when I wake up.<br>
Waking up early... is just a way to better enjoy going back to sleep... Zzz...<br>
The bird gets the early worm... The worm gets the early bird...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Did you really fall asleep mid-conversation?<br>
Oh, no... I'm getting sleepy, too...<br>
<br>
Is it because of the dim lighting, or is it Perseus's sleepy breathing rhythm?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Well, it is my day off... Might as well rest...<br>
<br>
Off to dreamland I go...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Perseus：</span><br>
Heheheh...<br>
Now the early bird and the early worm have been devoured by the evil bed...<br>
Get some rest, my beloved Commander...<br>

3 Moonlit Boat Ride<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Anchorage：</span><br>
Teacher, look...!<br>
Up in the sky... It's the moon...!<br>
Pretty...<br>
<br>
Anchorage, poised on the bow of the boat, leans forward and points up at the moon.<br>
It peeks out of thick clouds blown about by the wind.<br>
Our boat floats atop the lake, which reflects the moonlight and lights above like a mural of stars.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Anchorage：</span><br>
The moon's all shiny and pretty...!<br>
<br>
I relax and watch Anchorage go crazy over the beautiful moon.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(I'm just glad it's out tonight... Nights without the moonlight are lonely.)<br>
Are you having fun, Anchorage?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Anchorage：</span><br>
Yeah...! Anchorage is having fun...!<br>
Boat rides with Teacher are fun!<br>
The boat's rocking and bustling...<br>
It's neat!<br>
And my new clothes...<br>
You gave them to Anchorage... I love them!<br>
Anchorage has a present for you, too...!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
A present for me?<br>
(What is it? I'm curious.)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Anchorage：</span><br>
It's the moon!<br>
The moon in the sky... is for you!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
The moon, you say?<br>
And how do you plan to give me that?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Anchorage：</span><br>
Hehe... This time... Anchorage can teach you!<br>
Take the moon... like this!<br>
<br>
Anchorage stands up and reaches out toward the moon.<br>
It looks as if she's taken it into her right hand.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Anchorage：</span><br>
Join me, Teacher!<br>
<br>
Anchorage beckons, so I reach out my hand as well.<br>
Outstretched toward the night sky, our hands touch each other and encircle the moon.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Anchorage：</span><br>
We did it... We grabbed the moon!<br>
It's yours, Teacher...!<br>
Do you like it...?<br>
<br>
There's only one answer to that question.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：I love it!</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Anchorage：</span><br>
Hehe... Me, too!<br>
Anchorage loves you, Teacher!<br>
