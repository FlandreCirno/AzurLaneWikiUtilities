Shiranui, the Do-It-All Shopkeeper<br>
<br>
Chapter 1: Ice-Cold Shiranui<br>
Port - Office<br>
Ever since I let Shiranui become my secretary ship, I always feel like my mental fortitude is being exercised to its limit.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shiranui：</span><br>
Am I supposed to say "long time no see?"<br>
What a dullard, wasting precious resources on me again...<br>
If you wanted to be treated coldly so much, you might as well have just stood in the refrigerator, you moron.<br>
I've waited a whole minute and you still haven't noticed that your commissions have returned. Commander, without me, you're just a washed-up lump of driftwood after all.<br>
<br>
... these are just a few examples. On top of that, her expression - as cold and impassive as an iceberg - really makes one feel like even breathing is a mistake.<br>
And if dealing with her at the office was hard enough, when I arrived at the store...<br>
Port - Supply Shop<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shiranui：</span><br>
The next tech box will surely have something good...<br>
Discount? There's no such thing...<br>
Commander, if your luck is bad, you have to make up for it with quantity. Believe yourself. You can do it.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Buy! Buy!</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：CAPITALISM, HO!</span>'''''<br>
<br>
... Wait a second, this isn't the important part.<br>
The important thing is that even in the store, where the customer is king, she still acts this way?<br>
One really can't help but to wonder, is Shiranui only capable of making this expression?<br>
And what's more, how did Shiranui manage to become the head of this store?<br>
In order to solve these two mysteries, a little investigation is needed...<br>

Shiranui, the Do-It-All Shopkeeper<br>
<br>
Chapter 2: Daily Life of a Shopkeeper<br>
Port - Supply Shop<br>
On my day off, I decided to hide in the bushes next to the shop to see just what was going on.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nachi：</span><br>
Shiranui, did the package I asked you for arrive yet?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shiranui：</span><br>
Not yet, but I will deliver it to you myself once I get it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nachi：</span><br>
All right, thanks. As usual, keep it on the down low, okay?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shiranui：</span><br>
I know. Although sooner or later... no, someone surely has discovered your "secret" by now.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nachi：</span><br>
You sure don't hold any punches with your straightforwardness... Oh well, I'm counting on you again.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shiranui：</span><br>
Mhm.<br>
<br>
... ...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hatsushimo：</span><br>
Shiranui, I see you're still holding down this shabby fort like always.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shiranui：</span><br>
I see you're still running your mouth like always.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hatsushimo：</span><br>
You're one to talk~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hatsuharu：</span><br>
H-Hatsushimo, don't talk like that...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Wakaba：</span><br>
It's totally fine, Hatsuharu, getting into a spat is just the daily routine for these two.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shiranui：</span><br>
Don't make it sound like we get along...<br>
Having said all that, since you're already here, might as well come in and take a look.<br>
<br>
... ... ... ...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shiranui：</span><br>
Phew, after that... let me check on the status of Kuroshio's ninja equipment and Oyashio's doll supplies.<br>
That's right, the new fabrics that Urakaze asked for should be here in about two days.<br>
<br>
...From an observer's standpoint, one has to admit that Shiranui is a pretty diligent shopkeeper.<br>

Shiranui, the Do-It-All Shopkeeper<br>
<br>
Chapter 3: The Shopkeeper's Little Buddies<br>
Port - Supply Shop<br>
On this day off, I once again concealed myself next to the shop, quietly observing the situation.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Aoba：</span><br>
Please,  Shiranui, just think about the deep bond we used to share, and let me interview you!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shiranui：</span><br>
I don't remember ever doing anything with you that would resemble a "deep bond."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Aoba：</span><br>
Unapproachable and mysterious, the ghostly owner of the Supply Shop- this interview is gonna sell like hotcakes!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shiranui：</span><br>
If you used your segment to promote my shop, I might consider it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Aoba：</span><br>
No problem! Let's get started right away!<br>
First and foremost, those disheveled animal ears on your head! Is it true that the ghosts make you wear them like that?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shiranui：</span><br>
... I bumped them a few times while organizing things. I thought it'd be a waste to replace them, so I didn't bother getting them fixed.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Aoba：</span><br>
Uhh... the rumor that you're actually a ghost... Is it true?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shiranui：</span><br>
Are you an idiot?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Aoba：</span><br>
What about that will-o'-wisp circling you?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shiranui：</span><br>
That's just a floating prop that I got from Akashi because it looked cool.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Aoba：</span><br>
Th-then... the rumor that you can see ghosts as well...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shiranui：</span><br>
I suppose that does happen every now and then.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Aoba：</span><br>
Ah, so that's also a fabrica-<br>
Ehhh??? It's true?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shiranui：</span><br>
It's true. For example, there's one crawling up your back right now...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Aoba：</span><br>
Waaaaaaaaaaaaahhhh!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shiranui：</span><br>
Of course, that's just a lie...<br>
However, our very existence already defies the laws of science. It shouldn't be strange at all to see strange things.<br>
<br>
Today, I feel like I learned a bit more about another side of Shiranui.<br>
However, I feel like she just shot a glance over here. It's just my imagination... right?<br>

Shiranui, the Do-It-All Shopkeeper<br>
<br>
Chapter 4: An Encounter at the Store?<br>
Port - Supply Shop<br>
On this day off, I once again concealed myself next to the shop, quietly observing the situation.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
Shiranui Nyaa~~!!!<br>
<br>
BAAANG!! I heard the sound of someone crashing into a wall.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
Uuuughh... that was cruel, Nyaa.... Why did you have to dodge away from Akashi?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shiranui：</span><br>
Because when this dumb cat seeks me out voluntarily, it's never to bring good news.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
I thought we were good friends Nyaa~~!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shiranui：</span><br>
That's news to me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
Shiranui is the same as always, Nyaa. You should learn a thing or two from Akashi, full of vigor every day Nyaa!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shiranui：</span><br>
I'll pass. Anyway, what's the matter?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
It's about the new promotion plan, Nyaa!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shiranui：</span><br>
No good news after all. Every time this dumb cat pushes her promotion plans, something weird always ends up happening. Don't drag me into this.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
But it's different this time. It's going to be comprehensive, Nyaa!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shiranui：</span><br>
Look, I'm not in-<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
Shiranui, please help me, just this time Nyaa! Akashi will definitely repay you!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shiranui：</span><br>
Stop clinging to me... this dumb cat better let go...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
I won't let go until you say yes!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shiranui：</span><br>
Fine, fine.. I'll fund you!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
That's great, Nyaa! Here is the business proposal. Akashi will go ahead and make preparations, Nyaa!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shiranui：</span><br>
After Akashi leaves, Shiranui skims through the business proposal.<br>
*sigh*... Once again, it's full of errors and loopholes. Looks like I'll have to help that dumb cat wipe her own butt again.<br>
<br>
Despite her grumbling, Shiranui picked up the pen and started making corrections on the document dutifully.<br>
It seems that I've been able to learn a bit more about Shiranui.<br>

Shiranui, the Do-It-All Shopkeeper<br>
<br>
Chapter 5: The Shopkeeper's Abnormality<br>
On this day of rest, I found myself headed to the bushes outside the store as always, with plans to observe Shiranui.<br>
... Eh? As always? Come to think of it, I've been observing Shiranui for quite some time now.<br>
Although she wears the same aloof expression both during work and during her everyday life,  her behavior shows that she is certainly not some callous ice queen.<br>
However... ...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shiranui：</span><br>
Commander, just what are you doing camping out in those bushes? Should I trim them to make them more accomodating for you?<br>
Well, since Shiranui seems to have found me, there's no point staying hidden.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Ask about when she found out</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shiranui：</span><br>
From the very beginning. Since you weren't getting in the way of business, how you choose to spend your time off is your own prerogative. It's up to you, Commander.<br>
However, for you to come every single weekend...wouldn't any normal person start to believe that you have some loose screws?<br>
<br>
Looking at things from her perspective, she certainly has a point!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shiranui：</span><br>
So, Commander, tell me what are you looking at?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Express your desire to understand Shiranui better</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shiranui：</span><br>
... You're an idiot after all. If you wanted to know, you could have just asked me directly.<br>
If I did that, I would have just been treated like an idiot! Although this...<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Ask to help</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shiranui：</span><br>
Huh...? There's no need for that. Commander surely has other responsibilities, so I can handle things here by myself.<br>
<br>
That's right. Shiranui always knows how to handle things well without anybody else's help.<br>
She never seems to need to rely on anyone, always managing all aspects of the store by herself as if it was second nature. However...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shiranui：</span><br>
Commander, don't just stand there like an idiot. If you have time to burn...<br>
Before she could finish her words, Shiranui's body began to sway, as if she was about to collapse.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Hold her</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shiranui：</span><br>
Don't worry, I just got a little dizzy...<br>
<br>
You should pay Akashi a visit anyway.<br>

Shiranui, the Do-It-All Shopkeeper<br>
<br>
Chapter 6: The Shopkeeper's True Feelings (Pt 1)<br>
Port - Infirmary<br>
At the infirmary, Shiranui is quietly lying on a sickbed.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
It's overwork, Nyaa.<br>
Sure enough...<br>
It would seem that having to serve as secretary while also running the store has caused her to accumulate a lot of stress, Nyaa.<br>
If only I had noticed sooner...<br>
Commander, you don't need to blame yourself Nyaa. This is just Shiranui's personality, she does everything meticulously and never asks for help from anyone.<br>
Even Akashi never noticed how burnt out she was, Nyaa. Her expression didn't change at all...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shiranui：</span><br>
Pipe down, dumb cat.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
Patients should just quietly lie there and rest. Shiranui is way too stubborn, Nyaa!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shiranui：</span><br>
... I'm not trying to be stubborn, I just...<br>
I'm used to having to do things all alone.<br>
<br>
The Shiranui that sat up from the sickbed still wore the same expression as ever but, compared to usual, seemed a lot more vulnerable.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
What a troublesome fellow, Nyaa...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shiranui：</span><br>
You're the last one I want to hear that from.<br>
I was relieved to see that Shiranui was fine, but it was clear that things could not continue like this.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Suggest that Shiranui should focus on one thing first</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shiranui：</span><br>
……<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
Hmm. I'm not sure that's going to work.<br>
<br>
Eh? Even Akashi is opposed to that idea?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shiranui：</span><br>
*sigh* ... This person sure is dense.<br>

<br>
Chapter 7: The Shopkeeper's True Feelings (Pt 2)<br>
Port - Infirmary<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
You'll understand if you think about it a little, Nyaa~<br>
Whether it's Akashi's store or Shiranui's store, Commander still has to pay for everything out of pocket even though all the wares are supplied by the military, Nyaa.<br>
However, these will all eventually turn into resources used to build up the fleet, Nyaa.<br>
For Akashi and Shiranui, working at the store is also for the sake of helping out Commander! That's why Shiranui is capable of working so hard,Nyaa!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shiranui：</span><br>
Loose lips sink ships, dumb cat.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
And although she won't admit it, Shiranui is very happy to have been chosen for secretary, Nyaa!<br>
So for her, she would never be able to give up one or the other, Nyaa~<br>
Because both are for the sake of her beloved Commander, Nyaa!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shiranui：</span><br>
This dumb cat seems to be itching for a beating today...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
Nyaa~ ha ha, that's all Akashi has to say for today! Commander, the rest is up to you, nya!<br>
<br>
The room suddenly fell into an awkward silence.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shiranui：</span><br>
... Commander, you shouldn't dwell too much on what that dumb cat said. It's best if I handle things by myself.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Apologize seriously</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shiranui：</span><br>
I already told you, it's fine...<br>
... I'm only doing what I ought to be doing...<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Promise that you'll definitely help out in the future</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shiranui：</span><br>
... ... ... ... ... *sigh* What an idiot. Whatever... do as you please...<br>
It's because you do stuff like this... I couldn't help but to... ...<br>
<br>
Shiranui, sitting atop the sickbed, let out a sigh. However, ever so faintly, the corners of her lips seemed to curl upwards.<br>
Looking back, this was the first time I had ever seen her smile.<br>
