Path of the Chosen<br>
<br>
1 A Small Matter<br>
The brief adjournment period was over, and the Orthodoxy meeting venue burst back to life.<br>
The Naraka incident had been safely resolved, and due to changes in attitude among factions, starting with the Sakura Empire, the topic of reforming the Azur Lane was moving in a good direction.<br>
However, as expected, the question of how to treat Siren artifacts became a new point of contention.<br>
After several rounds of debate, a consensus was reached: Until all traces of Siren threat have been completely eradicated, the Azur Lane's function and organizational structure would remain as it is.<br>
For better or worse, because the elite Sirens went offline so suddenly, they left behind more operational facilities than we had imagined.<br>
Having already been completely cut off from test site beta, Observer was only able to provide the locations of those facilities. Wiping them out would require mobilizing fleets and dealing with them directly.<br>
It's clear now this is going to be a drawn-out war.<br>
Even once it's over, no one can predict how the power balance of the world will change after the fact.<br>
Just as I start to wonder how long this almost peaceful deadlock is going to last, I receive an encrypted message from Clemenceau.<br>
That alone is an ill omen of things to come.<br>
Somewhere in the Iris Orthodoxy<br>
Secret Tribunal Base<br>
XX meters below the surface<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kersaint：</span><br>
Welcome, Commander, to the Tribunal.<br>
This is all the information we've gathered on the case. Please read them when appropriate.<br>
Lady Clemenceau and Miss Shinano are still conducting their investigation, so before they return, I'll try to answer your questions.<br>
<br>
With a serious look, Kersaint hands me a stack of documents labeled "top secret."<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(This must include the details she didn't bring up in her message...)<br>
(Wait, what's this?)<br>
Marco Polo briefly "disappeared" not long ago?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kersaint：</span><br>
Yes. This occurred at the same time as your disappearance – the Day the Stars Faded.<br>
What's more, the phenomena surrounding both are alarmingly similar.<br>
Marco Polo disappeared and reappeared several times in front of the guards' eyes, her longest disappearance lasting an entire night.<br>
It wasn't until after the Sakuran ritual to remove cognitive influence over the whole world was performed that this event came to light, when Lady Clemenceau double-checked the records.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(That sounds like Madam M's doing, alright.)<br>
(Does this mean she was up to something else back then, beyond guiding me and engaging Helena in offense and defense?)<br>
(Marco Polo was inflicted with cognitive pollution around the time of the World Expo, and we still haven't completely removed the effects of it...)<br>
(I don't know what Madam M is planning, but anything that involves Marco Polo is very likely to be dangerous.)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Communicator：</span><br>
BEEP BEEP!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Clemenceau：</span><br>
Sorry for being late. Have you read the documents and figured something out yet?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
One thing I know for sure: Madam M, who might be an Arbiter, the Magician, is almost certainly involved in this case, and it poses a great danger to us.<br>
How did your preliminary investigation with Shinano go? Any findings?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Clemenceau：</span><br>
Things aren't looking good.<br>
Say, do you remember how – back when Akagi used the Watatsumi sample to cause cognitive interference on a worldwide scale – Veneto and Shinano made contact with Marco Polo within a dream?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I do. I read the report.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Clemenceau：</span><br>
Shinano and I tried to do that again, but to no avail. We could not summon her consciousness into the dream.<br>
More specifically, we did manage to enter her dream, but Marco herself was not present in the dream.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
She wasn't present in her own dream?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
Nay... Unlike the previous time, Marco Polo's soul isn't asleep. It has completely left the dream.<br>
All that remained, we suspect, was but a hollow vessel...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Her soul... left the dream?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
Aye... 'Tis this one's only explanation.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Is there any way to track down this "soul" or directly bring it back?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
Alas, not to this one's knowledge... However, this one has established a magic circle here, to serve as an alarm.<br>
It will be activated in the event that either Marco Polo's soul returns, or if someone attempts to interfere in reality...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
An alarm system, eh... That feels a bit too passive for me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Clemenceau：</span><br>
It is. So, Commander, are you willing to enter the dream with Shinano and I to investigate further?<br>
Your keen eyes may be able to find an invaluable clue that we have missed.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Just what I was hoping for. Let's get started as soon as we're ready.<br>

<br>
2 Sworn Protection<br>
Somewhere, in an unknown location...<br>
Helena META's Communication Space<br>
I told Helena META about Marco Polo's disappearance. Late in the following night, she suddenly contacted me.<br>
As the light fades, I find myself not in the vast, empty space that I expected, but rather in a land constructed of metal.<br>
Countless automated machines operate in perfect sync, gathering unusual materials from all directions and transforming them into an enormous building.<br>
It looks like the making of a steel city, like the one that surrounds a Siren's mainframe.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
Are you satisfied with this gift?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I'm speechless... I can't believe you're reconstructing a Siren experimentation structure at this speed.<br>
Is it based on the phantom test site?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
Yeah. Official designation: the Empress' Pearl. Named such by – you guessed it – the Empress.<br>
Its value lies less in its cognitive interference skills and more in its independent computing and simulation capabilities.<br>
That's why I decided to make it Observer's new base.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Is it safe to use, given its connection to the Empress?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
Don't worry. It is essentially the same as a lower-level program like an Enforcer. It cannot reject being reprogrammed by the Tower.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Are you able to control the Enforcers of other Arbiters, then?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
Under the right conditions.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I see. Would it be possible to reverse-engineer this machine and mass-produce it?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
Let's not get ahead of ourselves.<br>
What we can mass-produce, now that we have the help of an entire Siren experimentation team, is the Executor class. In theory.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
In theory?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
Well, even the Empress' Pearl can't make things out of thin air. To begin mass production in earnest, the Tower would have to constantly supply us with materials.<br>
Doing that... comes with a lot of risk, though.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
If it's materials you need, you can just take them from other planets if you have to. How about... Mars?<br>
I mean, the Tower is capable of interstellar travel, right?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
No. The Tower isn't like that, and Antiochus must never venture into space.<br>
All I can say is that it's a part of their core programming. Don't ask for details.<br>
Anyway, back on topic. Currently, the main purpose of the Empress' Pearl isn't manufacturing, it's running simulations.<br>
In essence, it's an independent supercomputer that doesn't rely on the Tower, the Sea of Stars, or any other third party.<br>
Not only can it reasonably predict the future, but it can also develop technology and repair, nurture, and strengthen the minds of shipgirls.<br>
In fact, not just shipgirls, but artificial intelligence as well.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
It can repair... and strengthen minds?<br>
Can it also repair a damaged hull, or at least undo the damage to the mind?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
To a degree. Strictly speaking, the Sea of Stars can do the same, but that's not the central point here.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
So let me get this straight – it's an unassailable supercomputer that can also cure minds of shipgirls and benefit AIs as well?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
Yes. Next, Observer is going to rebuild her whole experimentation team's mainframes in this place.<br>
They will then resume all the research projects and simulations kept in their databases.<br>
Remember our talk about solar activity a while back? It's almost time to tell you about that.<br>
Ah, but enough about me... How is the situation over there? Good?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Could be better, could be worse. Marco Polo is still asleep and her consciousness hasn't returned.<br>
I think something bad is happening outside of our view. If we're going to respond to it, we need to act quickly.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
Yeah. I got to work as soon as you told me.<br>
Allow me to explain the plan.<br>
To get straight to the point: I suggest that you physically bring Marco Polo to me through the NA Ocean Singularity.<br>
This place is stable, and if anything does happen to her, it'll be easier to respond from here.<br>
As you suspect, the Magician is involved with Marco Polo being unable to wake up.<br>
I might be able to take advantage of the current condition she's in to lure out the Magician and then turn the tables on her.<br>
She loves to meddle in other people's business – let's see her try to do it again.<br>
<br>
While it certainly doesn't show in her expression, her distaste for the Magician drips from every syllable.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Didn't you defeat her last time?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
No. She simply ran away when it suited her.<br>
Once I finally got time to check on test site beta, she had already removed all of her traces... until you found out about Marco Polo, that is.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
She must be a real piece of work, then. Can you tell me what you know about her?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
Well... I don't really know much about her at all.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Really? You don't have any intel?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
What intel I do have is way out of date. So much has changed that I didn't even think it was her behind all this.<br>
Not only has her manner of attack changed, but now she's even presenting herself as "Madam M" and acting like a human...<br>
Also, of what things I do know, there's very little I'm even able to tell you.<br>
But... I'll try.<br>
Arbiter: The Magician Ⅰ, her initial AI personality served as test site alpha's Spectral Moon...<br>
She was born in a laboratory somewhere, following... an event that occurred in timeline alpha.<br>
Her main mission at the time was to screen and judge... the extent of X's... interference with personnel and facilities.<br>
That is, until after the... evacuation was complete, when Antiochus and the Ashes still worked together, and she became an Arbiter.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(She's really agonizing over what words to use...)<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
Her abilities are tied to interference... She's able to perform all kinds of interference and has functions that counteract them.<br>
She's different from all other Arbiters you've met up to this point.<br>
They all have areas they specialize in and possess cutting-edge equipment and weapons related to that field. You know that much, right?<br>
The Magician's standout equipment is something that's not a standard feature of Arbiter vessels. That does not mean it's unique, though.<br>
They're called MECHArbitrators – a type of unit that can be produced in limited quantities... Ahem. Think of them as aircraft carried by a rigging.<br>
Even though they're a part of the rigging, they can act independently and be remote-controlled. Multiple of them at a time, even.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Can they fly, just like aircraft?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
Yeah.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I think I have some idea now. Using unique, specialized weaponry as a mass-production standard... Do those of the Hermit's fall under this category?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
That's right. You've worked with a Hermit vessel firsthand, no?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
But the idea of using non-reproducible weaponry seems to contradict the Antiochus' core strengths of large-scale mass production.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
That's the compromise.<br>
Just as with Laplace's Demon and the Natural Calculation System, there will always be pieces of cutting-edge technology that are extremely difficult to mass-produce.<br>
The same is true of the Tower.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
You mention the Tower a lot... You're talking about the machine, not the Arbiter, right?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
Correct.<br>
It's not just Tower who has one, Moon does as well. It's a lot larger, as you might expect, and a pretty incredible machine.<br>
As for cases similar to Magician, you have Star. Hers can be produced on a small scale.<br>
<br>
She is being unusually forthcoming with this information.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Should you be telling me this?</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：Should I be hearing this?</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
Don't worry. I left out bits you shouldn't hear.<br>
Magician fooled you with her tarot cards, didn't she? That's why I told you directly.<br>
<br>
All of a sudden, she seems to be in a good mood.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I see. Is there anything else you could tell me?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
...No.<br>
Anyway, back to the Marco Polo issue. The best solution available right now is to transfer her here and leave her under observation. Clemenceau won't refuse.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Alright. I'll go back and work out the details then contact you later.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
Got it.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
That's everything, then. Actually... Is a certain Yorktown somewhere around here?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
Why do you ask? Are you trying to bait an answer out of me?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I figured it was worth a shot.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
I see. So you were watching back then after all.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Not exactly. All I saw in the Sea of Stars was a shadow. My gut just told me it was her.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
That was someone you cannot speak to. Not for the time being.<br>
Knowing that she exists is one thing, but you should pretend as though she doesn't.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Because the more you know, the more dangerous it is?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
Not this time.<br>
I've said enough. Any further and we'll be going into forbidden knowledge.<br>
Now it's time for us to part. You have work to do. Bye.<br>

3 In Pursuit of Big Scoops<br>
Sardegna Ecclesia - Rome<br>
On a street somewhere<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
Ah, Roma! Magnificent Roma!<br>
It's been years, yet your beauty, elegance, and greatness as the city at the heart of the Sardegnia League haven't changed a bit!<br>
I'm walking through your streets that have stood for millennia, breathing in your air, becoming intoxicated with i–<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
Can you be normal and, you know, NOT come up with your script while we're walking?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
Says the girl who's coming up with inventions while she's walking!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
Except that it doesn't affect how I walk, unlike you. Ahem... Old friend of mine, you are so unalike me!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
Okay, okay, just don't talk like that!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
Good.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
Do you really not feel it, though? The vibe in the air?<br>
The atmosphere seeping through the old city... It's the promise of a big scoop!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
That's just the conclave you're thinking of.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
This time, it's different!<br>
I've heard people say that the Apostle is gonna be a shipgirl!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
What? But there are no shipgirls among the Cardinals, and there's no way one just appeared in their ranks in the past few days...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
No way? Yes way! According to my secret intel, exactly that happened.<br>
They've been planning it for a long time and finally succeeded just recently.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
Wow, you knew even that?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
Of course! When you become a big-time journalist like me, you don't just have informants, you even get anonymous tips!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
Uh-huh... Do you have any scandalous scoops for me, Miss Bigtime Journalist?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
"Scandalous"... What, do you think I'm a tabloid reporter or something?<br>
If it's eye-catching scoops you want, I've got those! Heck, we're looking for more right now!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
Not "we," just you. I just happen to be going the same way as you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
Seriously? Our starting point, route, and destination are all the same!<br>
Well... The representatives from the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies should have arrived by now. Add to that the ones who arrived yesterday from Venice, Genoa, Milan, Florence...<br>
That's every representative from the whole Sardegnia League. If that's not suspicious, I don't know what is.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
Suspicious? I don't see anything suspicious about representatives showing up for a big ceremony.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
I mean, what does the Apostle's election have to do with them? Think about it.<br>
None of them came last time, or the time before that.<br>
This points to one thing: My informants are right, and a shipgirl Apostle is about to be anointed!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
Didn't the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies and the Republic of Venice already appoint shipgirls as their supreme rulers? This is nothing new.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
Ah, forget it! You just don't get it because your brain is only good for inventing things!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
Clearly, since you're so smart, you don't need to USE my inventions either.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
Sorry, sorry! That was out of line! Your genius is unparalleled, Great da Vinci!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
Thought as much.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
But seriously, why are you going in the same direction as me?<br>
I should've asked earlier, honestly. Are you, like, looking for someone?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
Maybe the anonymous informant you're looking for and the famous painter I'm looking for just happen to live on the same street.<br>
Oh, speaking of which, there's her house. Talk to you later!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
What, that one? Wait... That's where I'm going, too!<br>
Wait up, da Vinci! I think we're both looking for the same person!<br>

<br>
Path of the Chosen<br>
<br>
4 Plans Within Plans?<br>
NA Ocean - Area Near Central Singularity<br>
Tribunal Special Fleet<br>
Days later<br>
I look through the glass on the command deck. The entrance to the Singularity is clear as day.<br>
Since Marco Polo's status is a closely-guarded secret, it was decided that this mission would be handled solely by the Tribunal.<br>
After Clemenceau finished organizing the mission, she decided to remain in Europa to draw the world's attention away from us. The duty of escorting the fleet was left to Le Terrible and her fellow Tribunal members.<br>
Prior to departure, Shinano placed another magic circle alarm on the ship, like the one within the Tribunal's secret base. Just as a safety measure.<br>
Fortunately, nothing has happened on our journey thus far.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Terrible：</span><br>
Commander, there is just over 30 minutes until the agreed time. What are your orders? Shall we go in directly or wait a while longer?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
It's incredibly convoluted inside the Singularity. We can't afford to get careless even near the comparatively stable entrance.<br>
If we went inside early, we'd have to wait anyway and be in more danger all the while. Let's just wait.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Terrible：</span><br>
Understood. I'll perform another inspection in the meanwhile.<br>
Galissonnière, how is Miss Hat?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">La Galissonnière：</span><br>
No change in status. Same thing with Shinano's magic circle.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Terrible：</span><br>
Okay. Remain vigilant. We'll circle around for a while longer and enter the Singularity in 30 minutes.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">La Galissonnière：</span><br>
Got it!<br>
<br>
To ensure mission confidentiality, we're referring to Marco Polo by a codename in all our documentation and communications.<br>
The codename in question – Miss Hat.<br>
Clemenceau proposed it, and out of curiosity, I asked her about it.<br>
She didn't really explain why, she only said, "It's not like Marco can complain about it now."<br>
Regardless, nobody had any qualms with it, so it's the codename we went with.<br>
Half an hour passed without incident, after which we sailed the Tribunal's custom-made mass-produced ship into the heart of the NA Ocean Singularity.<br>
After another bout of that familiar dizziness, we found ourselves in a completely different sea.<br>
Gazing out the window at the red clouds overhead, I'm suddenly overcome with strong emotion.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(I'm getting used to moving through Singularities, for better or worse...)<br>
(Those clouds... That's a foreboding sign.)<br>
<br>
Everywhere I look, it's red – the color of danger and malice.<br>
However, one annoying aspect about Singularities is that you cannot judge them by their color. Red doesn't tell us anything concrete.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Communicator：</span><br>
BEEP BEEP!<br>
<span style="color:#c3abff;">Kasumi META：</span><br>
You're right on time. Thank you.<br>
If you're ready, then let's get started.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Kasumi? Where are all the others? I can't pinpoint your location from here.<br>
<span style="color:#c3abff;">Kasumi META：</span><br>
They're in hiding, just as Helena instructed.<br>
You can just leave your mass-produced vessel behind and turn back.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Hmm. Helena must be very confident that this is going to bait out Magician.<br>
<span style="color:#c3abff;">Vestal META：</span><br>
Mhm. Don't worry, Commander. We'll look after Miss Hat.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">La Galissonnière：</span><br>
Commander, Terrible, Shinano's magic circle started glowing!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Terrible：</span><br>
That light can only mean one thing...<br>
<span style="color:#c3abff;">Kasumi META：</span><br>
It's okay. Helena sent a message: "The target has taken the bait."<br>
She is already on intercept course on the outside. Just wait until the magic circle has returned to normal before you do anything.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(She took the bait almost immediately? We entered the Singularity only moments ago. It seems way too good to be true.)<br>
(Unless... maybe Magician set up some kind of mechanism to automatically notify her when Marco Polo entered the Singularity?)<br>
(Did Helena know about this, and that's why she directed us to come here?)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">La Galissonnière：</span><br>
Oh. Commander, the circle's back to normal.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Any word from Helena?<br>
<span style="color:#c3abff;">Kasumi META：</span><br>
She said: "Locked." Don't worry about her.<br>
Since the circle is back to normal, shall we continue the handover?<br>
As I mentioned earlier, all you need to do is leave your vessel behind and turn back. We'll take over from there.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Alright. Let me just log one last entry about Marco.<br>
<br>
Entering the lower deck of the vessel, I open the door.<br>
Immediately, my vision turns blank.<br>

5 Intro to the Eternal Night<br>
Sardegna Ecclesia - Rome<br>
Unknown location<br>
It was afternoon, and soft sunlight shone upon a quiet garden where a meeting was taking place.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Trento META：</span><br>
According to my intel, the Cardinals will announce the final result later today.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Giulio Cesare META：</span><br>
What a complete waste of time.<br>
I'm stunned that they pretended to discuss it for this long when they already made their decision ages ago.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Trento META：</span><br>
Don't put it like that. This is a very tough decision for the Ecclesia to make.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Giulio Cesare META：</span><br>
And yet, they are the biggest beneficiaries.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Bolzano META：</span><br>
Secularism and religion, royal and divine power, humans and shipgirls... There are too many things to balance and calculate.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Andrea Doria META：</span><br>
In the end, though, the Ecclesia took the step...<br>
A thousand years ago, the God's Judging Light smote the enemy that had invaded the heart of the empire. Not just that, it reshaped the very land it stood upon.<br>
Then the peninsula shattered into an archipelago. The empire fell, and the Ecclesia was born...<br>
Ever since then, we have lived in the light of that God.<br>
We were reborn in that divine light, but we are also bound by it and made to walk on the path that God laid out for us.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Trento META：</span><br>
It would be fine if it were just a belief, but that God is more than just a symbol of faith.<br>
Not only does He really exist, but He also has an army of steel soldiers resting beneath our feet.<br>
That knowledge has forbidden me from sleeping soundly even a single night since then...<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Andrea Doria META：</span><br>
Yes... That's why we've been trying to slowly and gently weaken the theocracy and separate that God from the secular world.<br>
The Ecclesia clearly didn't like that, however.<br>
What's more, they discovered that the shipgirl chosen by that God is the key to controlling His legacy...<br>
Be that as it may, the Ecclesia is heading in a dangerous direction. This forces us to take more drastic measures.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Bolzano META：</span><br>
I have been trying my hardest to avoid this scenario...<br>
But now, it has come to this. I am a knight of the Sardegnia League, and my loyalty is sworn solely to the League.<br>
Andrea, I believe your proposal is beneficial to the whole League.<br>
In this age where we strive for freedom, we cannot allow ourselves to be bound by God.<br>
If the Ecclesia won't change, we just have to change it ourselves.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Andrea Doria META：</span><br>
Heehee. Then we're finally all in agreement.<br>
Together, let us begin the eternal night.<br>

Path of the Chosen<br>
<br>
6 Project H<br>
In a familiar blank void, a lone door stands silently.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
This place again... But why?<br>
<br>
The barren white space does not answer.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
No... Something feels wrong... Different, somehow.<br>
It's like someone is watching me...<br>
This space isn't a void. Everything may look completely blank, but I think I can see something in the distance...<br>
<br>
I go with my gut and walk around for a while, but I'm unable to find anything except that half-open door – and pure whiteness in all directions.<br>
My gut feeling was wrong.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Guess all that's left is to go through this door...<br>
Here goes nothing.<br>
<br>
The moment I touch the door, everything around me changes.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dr. Aoste：</span><br>
Eutopia Savoy – Colonel of the Republic of Sardegna's Navy, military advisor to the Oceanic Federation, member of the Special Investigations Committee, and the modern-day Garibaldi.<br>
It's been a while. Welcome to the Eagle Union.<br>
<br>
Aoste and I enter a modestly-decorated guest room. A woman with blonde hair already inside watches us with a complicated look.<br>
Her lips part, a response to Aoste's greeting just on her tongue.<br>
Or so I thought. The only thing that escapes her mouth is a sigh.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Eutopia Savoy：</span><br>
...We meet again, you two.<br>
I thought you were here on an academic exchange visit?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dr. Aoste：</span><br>
Forgive me, I just wanted to break the ice. No need to be so tense.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Eutopia Savoy：</span><br>
Mhm. Was it you who came up with "the modern-day Garibaldi"?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dr. Aoste：</span><br>
Of course not. Do you think I would give you such a bland nickname?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Eutopia Savoy：</span><br>
The Magister... The Mysterious One... Yes, I suppose that's not like you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dr. Aoste：</span><br>
Exactly. I would go with something like Golden Hawk, or Swordbearer.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Eutopia Savoy：</span><br>
......<br>
<br>
It feels as though the temperature in the room dropped a few degrees.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dr. Aoste：</span><br>
Sorry. It was just a joke.<br>
At any rate, can you guess why the two of us are here?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Eutopia Savoy：</span><br>
Pushing the envelope, are we?<br>
I'm under an oath of confidentiality. Don't expect me to answer any questions regarding the Special Investigations Committee.<br>
That being said... I can share my personal opinion on some matters.<br>
Well, I've never concealed my opinions on those things anyway.<br>
So, what do you want to ask?<br>
<br>
......<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Tell me about ■■■.</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：What can you share about ■■■■ ■■■■■■?</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项3：I'd like to know about ■■■ ■■■■■.</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Eutopia Savoy：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''...As the name suggests, we let a terrible monster run free.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''The secrets and the dangers hidden within Wisdom Cubes have already far surpassed our expectations.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dr. Aoste：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Excluding mine.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Eutopia Savoy：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Right – surpassed the expectations of MOST of us.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''I think it's necessary to put an immediate stop to these insane experiments.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Eutopia Savoy：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''I think the Colonel is a true hero.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''His decision saved the lives of many people, and the destruction of Pandora's box saved even more.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''I can only hope that the box has been completely and utterly destroyed now...<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Whatever the case, I salute our dear friend.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Eutopia Savoy：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项3）</span>'''''...She was a good kid. She shouldn't have met the end she did.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项3）</span>'''''I promise you the Committee will carry out a fair investigation.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项3）</span>'''''May she rest in peace...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dr. Aoste：</span><br>
How is the situation Anzeel and the shipgirls?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Eutopia Savoy：</span><br>
I can't say it's very optimistic.<br>
Excuse me, correction: I don't believe it's very optimistic.<br>
I understand why people are so afraid about it... At the same time, far too many people have let their fear cloud their judgment.<br>
Especially those with the power to make decisions.<br>
We created shipgirls... We know their essence – their nature – better than anyone else.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dr. Aoste：</span><br>
Yet all these fabrications are just plausible enough to whip the masses into a frenzy.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Eutopia Savoy：</span><br>
Yes, and fear is the driving force behind it all.<br>
The things fear makes people do... It's ridiculous.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dr. Aoste：</span><br>
It's not all bad. I'm currently working on some projects to enhance shipgirl stability. For instance, Cube power limits and alarm systems – auxiliary equipment that can be fast-tracked into mass-production.<br>
Things will turn around soon.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Eutopia Savoy：</span><br>
That's good. I'll be looking forward to the results of this "shot in the arm," if you will.<br>
Unfortunately, I'm usually in Europa, and thus can't do much about most things happening across the pond.<br>
Still, if I can help you in any way, don't be afraid to let me know.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dr. Aoste：</span><br>
Then allow me to do so. We didn't come solely for the sake of academic exchange.<br>
You see, I'm looking for collaborators on a new AI mental model training program.<br>
The Republic of Sardegna is an excellent location. It was the least affected by the event... and it has a religious environment.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Eutopia Savoy：</span><br>
Come again? Religious environment?<br>
...Are you going to use that to train your AI model?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dr. Aoste：</span><br>
It's an idea. But before I decide, I want to lay out the technological groundwork.<br>
For now, I'm calling it "Project H." Would you be interested to learn more?<br>

7 The Apostle<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
From the clouds I descend, returning from Heaven.<br>
I walk through the city, feeling the enduring elegance and order of the world.<br>
I walk through the streets, feeling the life force and vitality of the world.<br>
I walk through the church, feeling the devotion and majesty of the world.<br>
My journey is finally over.<br>
<br>
Sardegna Ecclesia - Rome<br>
Cathedral<br>
The square was filled to the brim with people while the bright sun shone overhead.<br>
There was no commotion as anticipated. The people gazed at the cathedral's balcony with solemn expressions, silently waiting for something.<br>
"Someone came out!" a voice in the crowd shouted.<br>
"Yes, I saw it... That crown, that scepter – it has to be her!" continued another voice.<br>
"The Apostle has come!" yelled an ever-increasing number of people.<br>
The bells throughout the city all rang in unison, and the crowd was bubbling with excitement.<br>
The first meeting between the new Apostle and her people had finally come.<br>
Up on that balcony, the newly-anointed Apostle opened her eyes to an expectant crowd.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
...What?<br>
...Why are all these people looking at me?<br>
Am I... dreaming?<br>
I'm dreaming, aren't I?<br>
<br>
The Apostle closed her eyes, pondered for a moment, then opened them again.<br>
The crowd was still there, just as excited as before. No, if anything, their spirits were even higher than a few seconds ago.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
...I'm not dreaming.<br>
I'm not dreaming?! What's the meaning of this?!<br>
...The Apostle?<br>
Who's that?<br>
WHAT IS THIS?!<br>
<br>
To Be Continued<br>
