Halloween Chaos!<br>
<br>
Chapter 1: Everything According to Plan<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gneisenau：</span><br>
I've compiled all of the food, supplies, and other materials we'll be needing onto this list. Please take it to Akashi, we need it filled post haste.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Thank you, Gneisenau. You've been a great help.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gneisenau：</span><br>
Don't mention it. It's my pleasure to be of assistance to one such as yourself, Memphis.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Oh my! You do go on!<br>
Alright, now we're almost done with everything we need for the Halloween party. All that's left is...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Edinburgh：</span><br>
Aye! Halloween candy! You can let yours truly take care of that.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Oh! Yes! Thank you very much for volunteering, Edinburgh. We've got a lot of kids running around here who certainly can't go without their candy.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gneisenau：</span><br>
Edinburgh, you're dressed as... a witch?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Edinburgh：</span><br>
Hehehe... what do you think? I designed it myself. When I finished it ahead of time, I figured I might as well put it on.<br>
(Let's not talk about how Bel actually put it together for me.)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Heh~ You have good taste.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Edinburgh：</span><br>
Right? Hmph, if only Bel could see. She said she's too busy with her Head Maid duties to join us... is it really so hard to make some time for me?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Seems like there are several problems here...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Edinburgh：</span><br>
I'd like to celebrate a holiday with my sister, you know. It's not like they come around often~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
(I understand where she's coming from though...)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gneisenau：</span><br>
A costume party, is it? Maybe I should look into it...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Oh? You like this sort of thing, Gneisenau? I had no idea...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Edinburgh：</span><br>
Ah, if you'd like, I could ask the Maid Team to prepare an outfit for you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gneisenau：</span><br>
Oh, thank you very much, but no. I have an idea of my own...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Edinburgh & Memphis：</span><br>
... You do?<br>
<br>
Under Memphis's expert direction, the preparations proceeded apace. But unbeknownst to the team, a dark shadow was about to descend upon their Halloween party...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">？？？：</span><br>
Hee hee hee... Halloween candy, huh? ... I think things are going to get interesting...!<br>

Halloween Chaos!<br>
<br>
Chapter 2: Smalley's Delivery Service<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Charles Ausburne：</span><br>
Never fear, Little Beavers, my allies of justice, for I, Charles Ausburne, am here! What wrongs shall I right today?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fletcher：</span><br>
Please, Ausburne, be more careful. You're going to knock someone over throwing open doors like that.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Thatcher：</span><br>
That's just Ausburne being herself. You can't tell her not to...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Smalley：</span><br>
Phew... Oof...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Charles Ausburne：</span><br>
Hey! Smalley! What are you doing over there?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Smalley：</span><br>
Huh? Ausburne? ... With Fletcher and Thatcher.<br>
I am not Smalley. At present. I am a Witch of the Halloween Delivery Service.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fletcher：</span><br>
What's a Halloween Delivery Service...?<br>
<br>
And so...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Thatcher：</span><br>
Right... You're delivering candy for Edinburgh.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Smalley：</span><br>
Yes. That is the function of the Halloween Delivery Service.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Charles Ausburne：</span><br>
You carry on your back the hopes and dreams of children everywhere! Such an act of pure justice! We must offer our aid to a fellow hero!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Thatcher：</span><br>
Sigh... She's roped us into a whole 'nother thing... Just part of being a Fletcher, I guess. Might as well lend a hand.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Smalley：</span><br>
Oh? You want to join the Halloween Delivery Service!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fletcher：</span><br>
Hahaha. Smalley looks so pleased with herself. Yes, dear, we'd love to join the Halloween Delivery Service, wouldn't we, girls?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Everyone：</span><br>
Yeah!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Smalley：</span><br>
Yes! Oh my. How do we deliver this?<br>
<br>
The newly reconstituted Halloween Delivery Service found themselves face to face with a colossal pumpkin.<br>

Chapter 3: The Same Old Prank<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pumpkin?：</span><br>
......<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Smalley：</span><br>
This looks like a giant candy pumpkin. How are we going to move it though...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pumpkin?：</span><br>
KABOOM!!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Everyone：</span><br>
Whaaaa?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Charles Ausburne：</span><br>
The p-pumpkin exploded?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Abercrombie：</span><br>
You thought it was a pumpkin. BUT IT WAS ME, ABERCROMBIE! Ahahaha! Gotcha, didn't I?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Thatcher：</span><br>
Aagh! The candy's everywhere! Look, Abercrombie, I love pranks too but there's a time and a place...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Abercrombie：</span><br>
Sorry! Hey, Smalley, are you alright?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Smalley：</span><br>
Yes. But I lost the candy and my delivery service is ruined.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jiangshi?：</span><br>
I'll help... with the candy.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Smalley：</span><br>
Thank... you?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikazuki：</span><br>
Hip~ Hop~ Here. The Candy.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Abercrombie：</span><br>
Ahahaha! Mikazuki's a jiangshi! Great costume!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikazuki：</span><br>
Yes. Mikazuki is a jiangshi. Hip~ Hop~ Give me taiyaki.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Thatcher：</span><br>
You've all gotten into the Halloween spirit.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fletcher：</span><br>
Okay now, everyone pitch in and pick up some candy please.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Abercrombie：</span><br>
Eheehee! Sorry! I'll help!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Thatcher：</span><br>
Damn right you're helping, Abercrombie! This is all your fault to begin with!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Abercrombie：</span><br>
Let's not bicker needlessly about who did what!<br>
<br>
......<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Smalley：</span><br>
Candy collection complete. Halloween Delivery Service. Resuming operation...!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikazuki：</span><br>
No taiyaki here... Mikazuki will return to the Mutsukis... Goodbye... Hip~ Hop~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Abercrombie：</span><br>
I'm out too. Cheers~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Charles Ausburne：</span><br>
Abercrombie's almost as fast as a Little Beaver!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Thatcher：</span><br>
What do you say, Smalley?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Smalley：</span><br>
Yes. The Halloween Delivery Service rides again!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Everyone：</span><br>
Yeah!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">？？？：</span><br>
Hehehe... Infiltration successful...<br>

Halloween Chaos!<br>
<br>
Chapter 4: Suiting Up<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Terror：</span><br>
I finished getting dressed... Erebus...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Erebus：</span><br>
......<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Terror：</span><br>
Erebus?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Erebus：</span><br>
Yes, but... Must we go to this party...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Terror：</span><br>
Please...? I really want to go with you, Erebus...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Erebus：</span><br>
... Right, but... Just give me a moment.<br>
<br>
......<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Erebus：</span><br>
How do I look?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Terror：</span><br>
Ooh... Erebus, you make a great witch...<br>
I'm so happy I get to go to the party with you, Erebus...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Erebus：</span><br>
If you're happy, Terror, that's good enough for me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gneisenau：</span><br>
You really won't go with me?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Scharnhorst：</span><br>
Damn right! What's the point of some namby-pamby frou-frou dress up party? Call me when they got a pumpkin-smashing gunnery competition or something worth my time!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gneisenau：</span><br>
... Of course.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Scharnhorst：</span><br>
And what's this goblin getup you're in? Doesn't leave much to the imagination! ... They're gonna remember you, that's for sure.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikazuki：</span><br>
Hip~ Hop~ The Halloween party should be...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mutsuki：</span><br>
Sniff... I smell candy! It's coming from that way! But... there's another smell mixed in here...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Abercrombie：</span><br>
Heeheehee! It's almost time! Time for me to be crowned this year's Queen of Pranks!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nelson：</span><br>
Abercrombie... I don't like the look of that smile. You'd better not be planning any pranks! Does someone want another lecture from Hood?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Abercrombie：</span><br>
Auntie Hood?! ... Phew, she's not here. I almost had a heart attack...<br>
<br>
Whatever their feelings about the party, everyone was about to experience Halloween Chaos!<br>

Halloween Chaos!<br>
<br>
Chapter 5: Party Chaos<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
I want to thank everyone for your help in making this Halloween party run smoothly. You all did great!<br>
That's all I have to say. Please enjoy yourselves. Help yourself to some pumpkin pie. And don't go too wild with the pranks!<br>
Those of you who want candy, or want to help hand it out, please see Edinburgh.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Edinburgh：</span><br>
That's right! I'm tonight's master of candy. Step right up!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Everyone：</span><br>
Yeaaah!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Smalley：</span><br>
Trick or treat.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Edinburgh：</span><br>
Here you are! And thanks so much for your help, Smalley.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Smalley：</span><br>
It was nothing. Thank the Halloween Delivery Service.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikazuki：</span><br>
Hip~ Hop~ Trick or treat. Mikazuki craves taiyaki.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Edinburgh：</span><br>
Ahaha! I'm afraid I've only candy, dear.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikazuki：</span><br>
Oh... I can give candy to Mutsuki.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">？？？：</span><br>
Can I have some candy as well?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Edinburgh：</span><br>
Alright. You want to help hand it out to the kids? Here, I'll give you a bag... G- Gneisenau?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gneisenau：</span><br>
Hm... Judging by your reaction, I think I chose my costume well.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Edinburgh：</span><br>
It's... It's quite something, it is... You're a succubus, are you?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gneisenau：</span><br>
It's always witch this, witch that on Halloween. I certainly didn't want to be just another witch.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Edinburgh：</span><br>
Well... I'm afraid I don't know how to respond to that...<br>
<br>
While the two of them enjoyed a friendly chat, something awful was brewing elsewhere...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ark Royal：</span><br>
Th- this is what the destroyers' candy tastes like...? I can feel something building inside of me. It's a powerful explosive force... Nnngg...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikazuki：</span><br>
Um... Ark Royal? Ark Royal? Is she dead...? Will she be a jiangshi too?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mutsuki：</span><br>
This candy, it smells a little different... There's something else mixed in? Hmm...<br>
Uuaaaaggghhh...<br>
<br>
Her anguished cries echoed back and forth across the party.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Edinburgh：</span><br>
Wh- what happened? Did the candy go bad? I prepared it myself, it couldn't have...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gneisenau：</span><br>
I suspect the candy has been adulterated with some foreign substance.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Abercrombie：</span><br>
Ahahahaaa! AHAHAHAHA! My ultimate Halloween prank is a roaring success! Is everyone enjoying Abercrombie's Apocalyptic Wasabi Candy?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Smalley：</span><br>
N, no...!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Abercrombie：</span><br>
Heeheehee! I've been planning this caper since the very beginning and it feels fantastic to see it pulled off without a hitch! You may call me the Queen of Halloween Pranks from now on! Ahahaha!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
From our very first meeting...!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Abercrombie：</span><br>
Precisely! Now I bid you all a delightfully chaotic Halloween as I think it's time I made my daring escape! Toodle-oo!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">？？？：</span><br>
Oh, what a crafty little dickens you are, "Queen of Halloween Pranks."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Abercrombie：</span><br>
Oh no... It can't be...<br>
Auntie Hood?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hood：</span><br>
... How many times have I told you? Don't. Call. Me. Auntie. Hood!!<br>
My deepest apologies to you all, I'm afraid this girl needs a more "thorough education" in how to behave.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Abercrombie：</span><br>
Nooo! I swear I won't do it again, Aunt- err, Sister Hood! Please let go of my ear! It's gonna fall off! You're tearing it!!<br>
<br>
And so we draw the curtain on our story of Halloween chaos. Thus end the wails of terror and grief. Happy Halloween. Happy Halloween?<br>
