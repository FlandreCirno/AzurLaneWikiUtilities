<br>
Sakura Empire Encampment<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kaga：</span><br>
Sister– Ahem... Akagi. About that invitation from the Iron Blood...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Yes, I know the one. The invitation to their floating fortress for a demonstration of their latest technology.<br>
I believe they said it's to return the gesture after we invited them to participate in one of our sacred rites.<br>
It's a favorable trade for what we let them see at the Diadem of Light, for sure.<br>
Although, the timing of this invitation is inopportune. We cannot send a sizable fleet to the Iron Blood right now.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kaga：</span><br>
Mhm. And if we ourselves go, it'll complicate our joint operations.<br>
Sure, we might gain some technological insight, but we'd also be inviting our enemies to take advantage of our absence.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Precisely. Monitoring the Sirens and gaining more valuable intel is our top priority. Focus on that instead, Kaga.<br>
Until we have what we need, the Sakura Empire will not mobilize on any large scale.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kaga：</span><br>
As you say. I'll tell them we have to decline their invitation.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Who said anything about declining it? The Iron Blood is our closest ally. We can't say we're too busy for them.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kaga：</span><br>
Then what do you suggest? It's not like we could send Lady Nagato...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Then I suppose we have to find someone suited for the job, won't we?<br>
Anyone come to mind, Kaga? While I doubt the Iron Blood will show us anything too spectacular... you never know.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kaga：</span><br>
Since you and I are both out of the question... I think we have to appoint another envoy.<br>
Perhaps we should request someone higher up...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Surely you don't think they'd concern themselves with such trivial matters.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kaga：</span><br>
You have a point. They have more important things to do.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Yes, and while it would be interesting to see them make a move, it would also place more eyes upon us–<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yamashiro：</span><br>
If... If I might make a suggestion! What about sending the Great Veteran?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
What about her, indeed? Am I supposed to laugh?<br>
Mikasa is completely off the table. She's too prone to sticking her nose into places it absolutely does not belong.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yamashiro：</span><br>
Oh, well... In that case, maybe–<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Shoukaku's merry gang? Not a snowball's chance in hell.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yamashiro：</span><br>
I see... Was it really that obvious what I was going to say...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Better to hold your tongue than to let the world know that you are a fool. Jintsuu, care to share your wisdom with us?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jintsuu：</span><br>
Certainly, if you're willing to lend an ear.<br>
If what you need is someone with an esteemed name who'll mind only her own business, then I can think of none better suited than Lady Shinano.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
(Not a bad idea. Knowing her, she'd rather get her beauty sleep than try to pry where she shouldn't.)<br>
Excellent idea, Jintsuu. I will take this proposal to our higher-ups. Shinano will act as our envoy to the Iron Blood.<br>
Finally... It's time to spring the next step of the plan into action.<br>
<br>
"Watatsumi Ritual held at the Diadem of Light, despite interference from Ashes members. Priority package from Akagi recovered."<br>
"Transmission detailing Shinano's course for the mainland received. Used to infer authenticity of the package."<br>
"Operation planned by Friedrich commenced. Floating fortress came under attack from Sirens. Peter Strasser's unit, with Sardegnian backup, fended the Sirens off."<br>
"Result: insight into process of controlling Mirror Seas gained. Equipment testing concluded."<br>
"Invitation to Sakura Empire higher-ups stamped and sent."<br>
「……」<br>
"I'm finished. Is my summary satisfactory?"<br>
"Mhm. Sounds good to me. Well done, Thiele."<br>
"Please, don't pat me on the head. It's infantilizing. Now, do you need anything else?"<br>
"Nope. The stage has been set. Now we just wait for the guests to arrive."<br>
"I see. In that case, I'll take a short nap. Wake me when it's time..."<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Katsuragi：</span><br>
My, Lady Shinano's estate is every bit as extravagant as you'd expect from someone of her standing! But I wonder... Is this really the right address?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chikuma：</span><br>
Yes, it is. I'm pretty sure this is the fifth time you've asked...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Katsuragi：</span><br>
Well, I'm just so excited to be here that I want to make doubly, triply, and quintuply sure! It's not that I doubt your eye, not at all.<br>
And I mean, how couldn't I be? I'm going to visit the one and only Lady Shinano, the shining example of aircraft carriers that we all strive towards!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chikuma：</span><br>
Understandable, but you don't have to repeat yourself five times...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimakaze：</span><br>
If I may interject... Even as fellow fully-fledged aircraft carriers, I do believe you and Lady Shinano differ in significant ways.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Katsuragi：</span><br>
What are you getting at, huh, Shimakaze? Are you implying I'm no good as an aircraft carrier and should become a cargo ship instead, huh?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimakaze：</span><br>
Nothing of the sort! All I wish to say is you and her both have your strengths and weaknesses! Likening the two of you is like comparing apples to oranges!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Katsuragi：</span><br>
Hmm... When you put it that way, you've got a point!<br>
Tell you what, you can have the honor of being the first to greet Lady Shinano. You're the fastest here, so be quick about it!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimakaze：</span><br>
M-me?! Really? Well, if you're sure... I'll be as quick as possible!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chikuma：</span><br>
Whoa... And just like that, she's off! She's really as fast as they say.<br>
<br>
A short while later...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Katsuragi：</span><br>
What's taking Shimakaze so long? She was just supposed to tell Lady Shinano we're coming to visit her estate!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chikuma：</span><br>
Yes, it's strange. In hindsight, maybe we should've gone with her.<br>
<br>
Sakura Empire Mainland - Shinano's Estate<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suruga：</span><br>
Welcome, dear visitors, to Lady Shinano's residence.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chikuma：</span><br>
Huh. I thought there'd be more people here. Where is everyone?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suruga：</span><br>
As it so happens, Noshiro, Ryuuhou, and a few others are out on a mission today.<br>
Ordinarily, nobody may leave or enter the residence while Lady Shinano is sleeping. Today is an exception.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chikuma：</span><br>
I see. Do give Lady Shinano my apologies for asking her to go out on such a sudden excursion.<br>
Oh, and please let her know that we'll do our utmost to ensure her safety.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suruga：</span><br>
Of course. Lady Shinano herself understands the grave importance of this operation.<br>
Are you able to wait another two days until we set off?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chikuma：</span><br>
Sure. Would it be possible for us to stay here until then?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suruga：</span><br>
Absolutely. An attendant will show you to your rooms soon. For now, have a seat and get some well-earned rest.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Katsuragi：</span><br>
Hey, one question! When are we gonna get to meet Lady Shinano?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chikuma：</span><br>
Katsuragi! Manners, for goodness' sake!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suruga：</span><br>
It's all right. Lady Shinano is quite lax when it comes to etiquette. If you wish to see her as soon as possible, I will let her know.<br>
At the moment, though, she's out on a stroll. The soonest you may meet is after the reception party, I'm afraid.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Katsuragi：</span><br>
Ah, I see! That'll do just fine.<br>
Actually, one more question! Have you seen a speedy shortie around these parts? She's supposed to have arrived by now.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suruga：</span><br>
No...? You're our first visitors today. Why? Is she a friend of yours?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chikuma：</span><br>
Yes. She went off ahead of us to inform you we're arriving. But, if she hasn't shown up, that can only mean she's gotten lost...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suruga：</span><br>
I understand. Lady Shinano's estate can be perplexing to navigate, after all. I'll put together a modest search party.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chikuma：</span><br>
Thanks. Sorry for inconveniencing you just as we got here.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimakaze：</span><br>
Here I was, on my way to Lady Shinano's residence...<br>
But then I got distracted by a beautiful bird which flew past me. It led me off course, and now I have no idea where I am!<br>
It's quite the embarrassing situation... I wonder how future me is going to explain herself to Katsuragi!<br>
Present me, however, needs to focus on getting back on the right path. Maybe there's someone around who can help? Let's find out...<br>
HELLOOOOO? ANYONE HEEEEEEERE?<br>
<span style="color:#92fc63;">???：</span><br>
...Hmm...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimakaze：</span><br>
Oh, thank gosh! There IS someone here!<br>
<span style="color:#92fc63;">???：</span><br>
A person...? What do you do amongst the bushes...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimakaze：</span><br>
Well, you see, I and my companions are here to see Lady Shinano at her estate!<br>
But, as you might've surmised, I'm a little lost at the moment...<br>
<span style="color:#92fc63;">???：</span><br>
You've never... met her before...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimakaze：</span><br>
Lady Shinano? No, but I'm thrilled to do so soon! I've heard only a select few have seen her in person!<br>
I'd go so far as to say it's an honor of the highest order to get to serve as her bodyguard!<br>
<span style="color:#92fc63;">???：</span><br>
Your name... is Shimakaze, is it not?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimakaze：</span><br>
It sure is! The one and only of my class of destroyer!<br>
<span style="color:#92fc63;">???：</span><br>
Are you friends... with Suruga...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimakaze：</span><br>
Hmm... Hard to say. We're acquainted, at least...<br>
I think I've been somewhat of an annoyance to her when we've worked together, and I'm actually not sure what she thinks of me...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
I've no doubt you'll reconcile, and be close friends one day...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimakaze：</span><br>
Mhm! I hope we do! By the way, Ma'am, would you mind telling me your name?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
Of course... Though it may surprise you...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suruga：</span><br>
Lady Shinano, your escorts have arrived. I advise you to return to your–<br>
……{namecode:18}？<br>
(So SHE'S the speedy shortie they mentioned! How'd she get on this job? And more importantly, how the hell did she get into Lady Shinano's back garden?!)<br>
What are you doing out here?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimakaze：</span><br>
Hi, Suruga! Well, I and the other escorts are on our way to meet Lady Shinano at her estate!<br>
Huh. I thought there'd be more people here. Where is everyone?<br>
Wait, something just dawned on me... Didn't you just address this person as "Lady Shinano"...?<br>
But then... You are...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
......<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimakaze：</span><br>
Oh god, oh god, ohgodohgod ohh...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
Hm... 'twould appear she has fainted...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suruga：</span><br>
(She blacked out?! Just from that realization?!)<br>
Y-yes, she has... Err, out of sheer excitement to meet you, Lady Shinano! Anyway, I'll carry her! Let us head back to the estate!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
Very well... As it stands, I'm already quite... sleepy...<br>

<br>
Sakura Empire Escort Fleet<br>
In the shimmering sunlight, a petite girl dexterously darted across the cerulean hues of the water's surface, her bunny ears bouncing along with the waves.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimakaze：</span><br>
Course: set! Signs of enemies: none! Bearing: clear!<br>
And best of all: no sharks trying to bite me!<br>
Nothing beats going fast in good weather! Today's my lucky day!<br>
<br>
Other shipgirls were just behind her. They were all part of the same escort fleet.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yamakaze：</span><br>
Bwahaha! So lemme get this straight... You got lost, ran into Lady Shinano, but didn't even recognize it was her?<br>
You're an absolute legend, Shimakaze.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimakaze：</span><br>
Uhh... Yeah, but that's not the kind of legend I want to be remembered for...<br>
(Honestly, I'm still cringing just at the memory of it!)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Umikaze：</span><br>
Um, I'm sure I'd also pass out if I found myself in front of Lady Shinano...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Katsuragi：</span><br>
Don't lose heart, girl! It'll all be water under the bridge once we prove to her how capable we are as escorts! Ahahaha!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimakaze：</span><br>
I hope so... I'm sorry for giving her a bad impression of us right from the get-go...<br>
To make up for it, I'm going to smash the heck out of any Sirens or stray enemies that get in our way!<br>
......<br>
Or so I'd love to, anyway, but there's no sign of enemies in the area... And without enemies, I won't get a chance to shine...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yamakaze：</span><br>
You can say that again... I'm getting bored...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Umikaze：</span><br>
True, but the weather is lovely at least. Blue skies, calm waves, and so many seagulls.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimakaze：</span><br>
Seagulls? But we're in the middle of the ocean!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Katsuragi：</span><br>
Maybe there are some islands around here which they use as a rest stop?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimakaze：</span><br>
A good guess, but that can't be true, Katsuragi. If you check the map Chikuma gave us, you'll find there are zero islands in the vicinity!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Katsuragi：</span><br>
Really? Then I've got no idea what they're doing here... Time to find out, aircraft carrier-style! I'll send out some recon planes!<br>
...Looks like there IS an island just off to the southwest!<br>
Shimakaze, go give it a quick look, would you? And don't get lost this time!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimakaze：</span><br>
Wait, there is?! All right then! I'll be back before you know it!<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=Onset of Peril|选项=4|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=否}}
<br>
As the party approached the island, a huge building towered above the water.<br>
In front of them was a lavish castle with pristine white walls, waterways flowing from a central spire like roads of cascading blue.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:18}：</span><br>
K-Katsuragi, any idea what this is...?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:208}：</span><br>
Just as lost as you are! However, using my extensive aircraft carrier knowledge of castles, I would have to surmise that what we're looking at iiiis...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:207}：</span><br>
I dunno, looks like the legendary Dragon Palace to me!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:208}：</span><br>
Yeah, exactly what I was going to say! Shimakaze, let's tell Chikuma that we found something real amazing!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:18}：</span><br>
Sure thing! Chikuma, can you hear me?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:62}：</span><br>
Loud and clear. Something to report?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:18}：</span><br>
Well, we went just a little off course and came across a hereto undiscovered island, and...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chikuma：</span><br>
That's... interesting. I would ask Lady Shinano about it, but she's asleep at the moment. For now, just stay put until I manage to get in touch with her.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Katsuragi：</span><br>
"Just stay put," she says... It only makes me more curious to see what's inside the castle! Am I right, Shimakaze?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimakaze：</span><br>
I won't deny I'm curious as well, but Chikuma did just give us very clear orders, so...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Katsuragi：</span><br>
We won't figure out what this place even is without going inside, will we? What's more, this is a chance for us to earn accolades! Letting this opportunity slide by goes against my principles as a proper aircraft carrier!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yamakaze：</span><br>
If the legends are true, there's bound to be mountains of treasure inside! I say, let's gooooo!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Umikaze：</span><br>
Even if there is treasure inside, I fear we're in no right to claim it...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Katsuragi：</span><br>
Oh, don't be such a stick in the mud! This is your best shot to earn Lady Shinano's respect after blacking out on her! Come on!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimakaze：</span><br>
...You make a very strong case, Katsuragi! On second thought, I'm going with you!<br>

<span style="color:#ff9900;">???：</span><br>
Um, Shinano, I have to ask you something first. What do you think of the commander?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
Commander... is the only one who understands what I've experienced...<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">???：</span><br>
Then, hold tightly onto the fragments of this dream when you awaken. And never forget what happened here.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
I see... This dream, too, is about to come to an end...<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">???：</span><br>
Yes... I am about to rewrite the very core of this Mirror Sea.<br>
I do not understand the principle behind your power, but... the aftershocks from what I am about to do will likely erase the fleeting changes you've been able to effect in this world.<br>
That... is when your dream will come to an end.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
Very well... Our meeting has been brief, but I will remember it forever... I wish you the best of luck...<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">???：</span><br>
(whispers) ...I'm sorry.<br>
Do not stray from your path. Become the light in the darkness to guide your friends.<br>
Three, two, one...<br>
<br>
KABOOOOM!<br>
Sakura Empire Fleet<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
......<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kasumi：</span><br>
Did you sleep well, Shinano?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
Ah... A fragment of bliss that tempts me to indulge in it for the rest of time...<br>
Kasumi... Do you know... the commander...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kasumi：</span><br>
Mhm. Kasumi knows the commander.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suruga：</span><br>
Do you wish to speak to the commander, Lady Shinano?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
Not quite... I simply... wish to learn more about that person...<br>
But first... How does Shimakaze's fleet fare...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chikuma：</span><br>
I was just informed they discovered a great castle atop an uninhabited island.<br>
Yamakaze described it as looking just like the legendary Dragon Palace.<br>
I ordered them to stay put until further notice so I could ask you how to proceed. What are your orders, Lady Shinano?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
The Dragon Palace... Never have I seen such a thing, not even in my dreams...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chikuma：</span><br>
We have reason to believe it's some sort of secret laboratory, as there's no record of an island ever existing there.<br>
But, seeing as they found it simply sitting out in the open...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suruga：</span><br>
...It's very likely to be a trap laid by the Sirens.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
If the Sirens are aware of us... then 'twould be folly to ignore this island...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chikuma：</span><br>
Should I order them to bombard the facility, then?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
We mustn't destroy this place if it is one of the Sakura Empire's secret facilities... And if it is a Siren facility, I do doubt if our cannons can even destroy it...<br>
But at the very least... we must determine if the Sirens are behind this...<br>
Chikuma, Suruga, my request for you... is to lend aid to the Shimakaze fleet...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suruga：</span><br>
But Lady Shinano! We can't leave your side! It's too dangerous for you!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
Worry not for my safety... I have already seen what fate has in store...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suruga：</span><br>
If so... Then very well! Chikuma and I shall join up with the vanguard fleet!<br>
(Ugh... I've got SUCH a bad feeling about this...)<br>

<br>
Dragon Palace - Outer Ring<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Umikaze：</span><br>
Um... I'm afraid we shouldn't be going so deep without waiting for instructions...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yamakaze：</span><br>
It'll be fine! This place is totally empty! Look!<br>
Rooooooooooooaar!!<br>
<br>
Yamakaze suddenly let out a roar that resounded across the palace's walls.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Umikaze：</span><br>
Y-Yamakaze! Wh-what if you woke somebody up...<br>
<br>
...But nothing happened at all.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yamakaze：</span><br>
There's nobody here except for us, yeah? It probably got abandoned a long time ago.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Communicator：</span><br>
Bzzt––––!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chikuma：</span><br>
This is Chikuma. I've arrived at the entrance of a place that appears to match the Dragon Palace you were describing. Katsuragi, Shimakaze, please copy.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimakaze：</span><br>
Chikuma?! And Yura as well as Suruga too? What are you all...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chikuma：</span><br>
Lady Shinano personally sent us here. Hehe, I see you already have plans of your own though.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suruga：</span><br>
(Ugh, I knew it... It's just like during that dumb mock exercise. Why do I get pulled around so easily?)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimakaze：</span><br>
S-sorry for acting without waiting for orders! What would you have me do?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suruga：</span><br>
(Wouldn't the obvious thing be to meet up first? Good grief, one look at this thing and it clearly has the Sirens' tentacle-prints all over it...)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chikuma：</span><br>
Let's see... We'll investigate the facility, and if it appears to be dangerous, we'll level it... In theory, anyway.<br>
So far, there doesn't appear to be anything questionable going on, but that can change without a moment's notice when you're dealing with the Sirens.<br>
As for the position of your fleet... W-wait, how'd you have time to get that deep inside?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimakaze：</span><br>
I'm so sorry! I just got caught up in the excitement of exploration...<br>
Now that you mention it, I did end up pretty far from the entrance, huh... I'll turn around and head back right away!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suruga：</span><br>
(How do you get so distracted that you lose track of your surroundings?! My stomach can't handle much more of this disaster waiting to happen...)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chikuma：</span><br>
If this really is some kind of Siren facility, there's probably no way for us to destroy it from the outside.<br>
However, we should be able to shut it down by locating some kind of control device, just like in a Mirror Sea.<br>
If we're lucky, there might even be some kind of self-destruct button lying around somewhere...<br>
But in any case, gathering intel should be our first priority. Shall we meet up first?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suruga：</span><br>
Shimakaze, Yamakaze, and Katsuragi, gather up and return to the entrance. Understood?<br>
<br>
––––––!!!<br>
Without warning, the Dragon Palace began to shudder violently.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimakaze：</span><br>
Mweeehhhh?! An earthquake?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chikuma：</span><br>
No, it's not! Get out of there this instant, Shimakaze! The whole building is starting to sink!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Katsuragi：</span><br>
Wh-what do you mean by "starting to sink"...?! I'm an aircraft carrier, not a submarine! There's no way I'd be able to handle going underwater!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimakaze：</span><br>
Even at my top speed, there's no way we'd be able to make it to the entrance in time!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yura：</span><br>
Katsuragi, have you noticed the "seal" at the top of the castle?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Katsuragi：</span><br>
Seal? I'm not sure I know what you're talking about, but we're all gonna drown if we can't make it to the entr–– Oh hey, the water level's not rising at all~<br>
So I guess the entire Dragon Palace is diving? Wait, won't that create a huge whirlpool that sucks everyone outside under?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chikuma：</span><br>
That would appear to be the case... Suruga, Yura, we'll have to enter this Dragon Palace, like it or not!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suruga：</span><br>
(I knew it, I knew it! Why'd I even bother trying to fool myself into thinking that nothing would happen?!)<br>

<br>
Shortly afterwards...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chikuma：</span><br>
We're pretty deep underwater, aren't we? The blessings of the sun and sky no longer reach us here...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suruga：</span><br>
I guess there really is some kind of "seal" around this place. Otherwise, the water would've come crashing in.<br>
(I thought we were goners... This sucks so bad, I want to go home already...)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chikuma：</span><br>
Our communications with the outside have been cut off as well... Yura, do you think this "seal" might actually be a Mirror Sea?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yura：</span><br>
Who knows? It looks to me like one of those bags at a koi-scooping stall. Except millions of times larger, and we're the fish...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chikuma：</span><br>
I had no idea it was possible to make something like this... Think it could be anything other than Siren technology?<br>
Considering how deep underwater we are, it's not even unusual for our communication to be cut off.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimakaze：</span><br>
Chikuma? Suruga? Anyone! Can anyone hear me?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chikuma：</span><br>
This is Chikuma. Shimakaze, are you alright?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimakaze：</span><br>
Right as rain! But... what do we do now?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chikuma：</span><br>
Let's see... Well, there's no way we can ask for help from Lady Shinano now. The first and only thing we can do is figure out how to get out of here...<br>
In any case, let's join up as we originally planned. The entrance obviously won't do any good for us now, so we'll have to explore around and see what we can find.<br>
At least there's some good news – my seaplanes are still working.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Katsuragi：</span><br>
Naturally, my planes are still operational!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chikuma：</span><br>
Good, we have plenty of "eyes" then. Now as for how we meet up...<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Mysterious Sound：</span><br>
"The Heart. The Heart is what you seek."<br>
"Within the Heart sleeps a secret and a treasure."<br>
"Indeed, only those who reach the Heart will again see the light of day."<br>
"Step forward, and find your way to the Heart."<br>
"Yes, the Dragon Palace shall reward the brave."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimakaze：</span><br>
That makes sense! Let's head to the center of the Dragon Palace!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Katsuragi：</span><br>
Would ya look at that, Shimakaze? What'd I tell you? There are treasures waiting for us inside these walls!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yamakaze：</span><br>
Treasure Hunt! Treasure Hunt! Treasure Hunt!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chikuma：</span><br>
I suppose having a landmark will make it easier for us to group up... I guess we'll meet at the Palace's "Heart" then?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suruga：</span><br>
(Whaaaat?! Is nobody going to comment on the mysterious ghostly voice giving us cryptic clues?!)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimakaze：</span><br>
Suruga, since we're going to meet up anyway, why don't we have a race to see who can make it to the center first?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suruga：</span><br>
Absolutely not.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimakaze：</span><br>
Ehhhhhhhh?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chikuma：</span><br>
Now, now. It won't hurt to have a common objective since we're all heading to the same place.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suruga：</span><br>
Fine, fine. I'll be counting on you to lead the way then, Chikuma.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chikuma：</span><br>
You got it. Hehe, I guess that makes us Team Chikuma?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimakaze：</span><br>
You're on! We'll be Team Shimakaze then!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:208}&{namecode:207}：</span><br>
Aye aye!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Umikaze：</span><br>
Aye... aye?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chikuma：</span><br>
Let's get moving, Team Chikuma.<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=Mass-Production Machine|选项=8|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=否}}
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Katsuragi：</span><br>
My planes have already finished scouting out this area. Now onto this path!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimakaze：</span><br>
Wow, Katsuragi, you're super reliable! There's no way we get lost with you around!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Katsuragi：</span><br>
Heh heh~ My recon planes are on a whole 'nother level from Chikuma's seaplanes! Feel free to shower me with more praise! Yes, keep it coming!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yamakaze：</span><br>
We've run into some straggler mass-produced ships, but they're pretty weak.<br>
Maybe this place really was abandoned a long time ago...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Umikaze：</span><br>
Is it just me, or have the waves been getting stronger and stronger...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimakaze：</span><br>
Huh, you're right! The deeper in we go, the rougher the waters get.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Katsuragi：</span><br>
We're in a pretty narrow waterway inside an enclosed area... How are there even any waves in the first place?<br>
Ahh! This must be what that voice meant by "rewarding the brave!" This must be like some kind of dungeon!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimakaze：</span><br>
So you're saying that the wind and waves here are a part of the Dragon Palace's mechanisms? Sounds like a job for heroes like us!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yamakaze：</span><br>
Woohoo! We're gonna be real life heroes!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimakaze：</span><br>
We got this! I'm already feeling that big protagonist energy!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Umikaze：</span><br>
Um, but... If the wind and waves continue to get stronger and stronger...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimakaze：</span><br>
At that point, we can just use one of those mass-produced ships!<br>
They might not be very strong, but at least we'll be able to use them to block the elements.<br>
After that, all we have to do is jump from enemy to enemy! If you go fast, it'll be totally fine!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Katsuragi：</span><br>
That sounds fine on paper and all, but you're the only person who can pull something like that off. An aircraft carrier like me can't keep up with a speedy destroyer!<br>
Having that said, I'll totally back you up though! No need to worry about the enemies – just charge through with everything you've got!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimakaze：</span><br>
Great! I appreciate it, Katsuragi!<br>
All righty then, it's time to go fast!!<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=Brave the Waves!|选项=9|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=否}}
<br>
Shimakaze darted between the enemy mass-produced ships, skillfully avoiding the increasingly tumultuous waves as she made her way to the Heart of the Dragon Palace.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimakaze：</span><br>
Gotta jump over that next huge wave and duck under that mass-produced ship up ahead...<br>
Woooah! It almost feels like I'm surfing!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Katsuragi：</span><br>
Shimakaze, do you see that weird-looking structure in front of you?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimakaze：</span><br>
Uhhh... Oh yeah, I do! There's some kind of energy reading coming from it!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Katsuragi：</span><br>
I think that's the mechanism causing all this! We'll need to hurry up and destroy it–<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimakaze：</span><br>
Right-o! Ready, steady... Wait, huh?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Katsuragi：</span><br>
Don't you know you have to bring the right class for the job? Now this... is where a full-fledged carrier gets to shine!<br>
Shimakaze, stand back! It's time for some aircraft-delivered fireworks!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimakaze：</span><br>
Oh, of course. You're up, Katsuragi!<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=Seals of the Dragon palace|选项=10|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=否}}
<br>
KABOOOOM!<br>
The seal around the mechanism dissipated under a fiery onslaught from Katsuragi's planes.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Mysterious Voice：</span><br>
"Congratulations... But your trial does not end here. Continue onwards."<br>
<br>
As the mysterious voice faded, so too did the violent wind and waves.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimakaze：</span><br>
Huh, smashing that thing really did the trick!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yamakaze：</span><br>
Hey, uh... What's with this pedestal...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Umikaze：</span><br>
Yamakaze, I don't think it's advisable to touch other people's belongings...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Katsuragi：</span><br>
That's right! We're still in enemy territory, so don't go around touching random objects without telling us first!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yamakaze：</span><br>
True, true! Phew, that was a close one...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimakaze：</span><br>
Say, how'd you know that the building was controlling everything?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Katsuragi：</span><br>
Well, let's just say... This whole thing seems to be based off of the Sakura Empire's rituals, and I happen to know a thing or two about that... *snap*!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimakaze：</span><br>
Woaaah! That's incredible, Katsuragi!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Katsuragi：</span><br>
Ahaha! Don't underestimate the power of a full-fledged aircraft carrier!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimakaze：</span><br>
I wonder who's more knowledgeable about these things between you and Yura~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Katsuragi：</span><br>
Uh, about that! Not like it matters, because you have me here!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yamakaze：</span><br>
Does it really not matter...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Katsuragi：</span><br>
O-of course not! What's the point of asking? Let's hurry up and keep moving!<br>
Otherwise, we're going to fall behind Team Chikuma! Shimakaze, I'll be counting on you to scout ahead!<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

<br>
Dragon Palace - Outer Ring<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimakaze：</span><br>
So then there was this... and that... and some more of that...<br>
And that concludes my scouting report! Let's hurry on towards the Heart!<br>
Please be careful, everyone!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chikuma：</span><br>
I must admit, I didn't think of the brute force approach to unlocking that mechanism that Katsuragi used... Heh.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yura：</span><br>
A bit unrefined, but I'm surprised you were even able to unlock the mechanism without applying the right method, as my Self did.<br>
Truly, our carriers never fail to surprise me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chikuma：</span><br>
I did agree to make this a race, but I didn't expect both our sides to take it so seriously~<br>
For better or for worse though, "they" have been sending us information, and I'm not sure what to make of it...<br>
Do you have any ideas, Suruga? Shimakaze's group is about to break through the outer ring.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suruga：</span><br>
(I thought it was a better idea to take a detour, but... Yeah, that's just like that fuel-for-brains. She rushed headfirst into the fray last time as well...)<br>
(Wait, doesn't this mean that Shimakaze's going to show us up? Wouldn't that make me the dumb one then?)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chikuma：</span><br>
Suruga? What's wrong? We're about to leave...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suruga：</span><br>
You asked for it. If it's a serious match you want, it's a serious match you'll get!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chikuma：</span><br>
Oh my. Are you finally starting to see the fun in our little competition?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suruga：</span><br>
(I'd be having more fun if we weren't trapped in a facility we have zero data on with no way of contacting the outside world, but...)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chikuma：</span><br>
All right then, let's keep moving forward and keep our eyes peeled for any other mechanisms!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suruga：</span><br>
(I don't want to do this, but I don't really have a choice...!)<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=Defense System?|选项=12|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=否}}
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yura：</span><br>
You know, this place really does look just like the Dragon Palace from our legends...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chikuma：</span><br>
That's true. There's no place like this on the Sakura Empire's maps though.<br>
I can't really see Akagi or Nagato doing something like this though. The Yamatos though... It might be more down their alley.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yura：</span><br>
I'd agree with that.<br>
...But, there is one more thing I'm worried about.<br>
They never said anything about the fairytale castle having weird traps and the like.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chikuma：</span><br>
In other words...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yura：</span><br>
All of this somehow feels like a defense system, but maybe not quite...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chikuma：</span><br>
We still don't have enough information, I suppose. Considering how we only just jumped in, we don't have much to work with.<br>
But first, it seems like we've got company... Everyone, be careful!<br>
Now then, let's get through this little puzzle~♪<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=Immovable Sentinels|选项=13|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=否}}
<br>
KABOOOOM!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yura：</span><br>
I'm sure that last shot landed, but I barely even felt anything...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chikuma：</span><br>
These mass-produced models are pretty old and busted, but isn't their firepower a bit too low?<br>
Having that said, I don't think our attacks are exactly having the desired effects either.<br>
Any luck on your end, Suruga?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suruga：</span><br>
None! We're gonna be stuck here forever if we keep fighting like this...!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chikuma：</span><br>
I can't tell if we're going to have any success with the direct attack approach, so let's try to avoid them for now and continue scouting ahead.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suruga：</span><br>
(Well duh, not everyone can charge headlong into the enemy like Shimakaze. Of course it's better to avoid fighting whenever possible.)<br>
(But is this really the right way of doing things...? While I'm in the back overanalyzing everything, Shimakaze's group is already about to break through...)<br>
It's so nice that Chikuma has a nice grasp over things with her "eyes." I'm glad I'm on this team instead...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chikuma：</span><br>
Did you say something, Suruga?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suruga：</span><br>
(Oh, crap! I let my tongue slip...)<br>
Err, it's nothing! I just was thinking out loud...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chikuma：</span><br>
If you have any suggestions, I'm all ears. Naturally, you bring plenty of your own expertise that I cannot hope to match~<br>
If you want to try leading the team, I'd be glad to pass that role to you any time~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suruga：</span><br>
I'm flattered, but err, I think things are better this way!<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=Getting Closer|选项=14|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=否}}
<br>
Suruga and her allies continued to press forward, neutralizing the mechanisms identified by Chikuma's "eyes" while fending off any enemies in the way.<br>
Though they struggled to eliminate the extremely durable mass-produced ships, they continued to make progress, slow and steady.<br>
However, the density of the enemy vessels continued to increase, to the point where they completely blocked off the waterway by lining up side-to-side.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yura：</span><br>
They're blocking the way forward, just like a metal wall...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suruga：</span><br>
Damn it, why are the obstacles along our path this ridiculous?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chikuma：</span><br>
We seem to be much closer to the Dragon Palace's control structure than Shimakaze's fleet... so I guess this is what we have to deal with.<br>
Suruga, are you able to bring your full firepower to bear?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suruga：</span><br>
Sure thing. I'm raring to go.<br>
I'm sick and tired of being stuck here... and I'll give a piece of my mind to anyone who blocks our way!!<br>
<br>
KABOOOOM!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chikuma：</span><br>
Yura, hurry up and push through the opening Suruga made for us!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suruga：</span><br>
(With how long we're taking, Shimakaze's probably getting ready to lap us by now...)<br>
Let's bust our way out of here, finish our mission, and then go back home already...!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chikuma：</span><br>
……{namecode:175}？<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suruga：</span><br>
Gaaah! Forget it, let's just keep going.<br>

<br>
Dragon Palace - Middle Ring<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimakaze：</span><br>
Woaah, it's even more grandiose in here than it was outside~!<br>
Katsuragi, do we really have to destroy a place this nice...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Katsuragi：</span><br>
Well, if this turns out to be one of the Sakura Empire's facilities, we're obviously not going to destroy it. But if it is a Siren facility, we don't have the numbers to collect all the information we possibly can and still ensuring Lady Shinano's safety... So that means we have no other options.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimakaze：</span><br>
Aww... I would've loved to show my friends around the Dragon Palace...<br>
Wait, if we're able to take control of this place and drive it back home, wouldn't we be able to avoid having to blow it up?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Katsuragi：</span><br>
You think big, and I like that! Can you imagine the way the people back home would shower us with praise and sing our glories?<br>
Oh~hohoho! People would address me as Lady Katsuragi, and as for you, the very wind would be named in your honor!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimakaze：</span><br>
Ehh? Do you really think I could become famous?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Katsuragi：</span><br>
For sure, for sure! You're already a very successful shipgirl, so you should start getting used to your future title – Lady Shimakaze!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Umikaze：</span><br>
If this is the real Dragon Palace... Decades could have passed when we return to the surface...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yamakaze：</span><br>
Good thing it's not the real deal then! What's with this crappy hospitality? They didn't even roll out a banquet for us!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Katsuragi：</span><br>
If it's hospitality you want, the only welcoming crew we're going to get are those mass-produced ships.<br>
Got it? We've arrived in a new area, so remember to keep your eyes peeled! If you notice any irregularities, I expect you to notify the others right away!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimakaze：</span><br>
Sure thing! Now, I wonder what kind of puzzles are waiting for us this time...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Katsuragi：</span><br>
If there's anything you can't figure out, just leave it to me! Let's start by taking down these seals, just like we did before!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimakaze：</span><br>
I'm on the job! Shimakaze, full speed ah––hwaaaah?!<br>
<br>
Shimakaze, who had been enthusiastically dashing forward, suddenly came to an abrupt halt.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimakaze：</span><br>
Th-there's an oil spill in the water? Wait, this is...?!<br>
<br>
Nearby, a black stain on the surface of the cerulean waters reflected the light of the Dragon Palace.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Katsuragi：</span><br>
Why would there be a patch of oil here?<br>
There's more of this stuff floating around all over the place! Even if everyone emptied out their supplies, it wouldn't create this much of a mess!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yamakaze：</span><br>
Think the enemy mass-produced ships might be leaking or something?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Umikaze：</span><br>
So much oil spilled into the ocean... What if it catches fire...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Katsuragi：</span><br>
Ugh, I don't even want to think about it! Everyone, be very cautious when using your weapons––<br>
Actually, no firearms at all, zip, nada, zilch! We need to get out of here, fast!<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Katsuragi：</span><br>
You've gotta be kidding me... Darn it, darn it, darn it!!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yamakaze：</span><br>
Well duh, the enemies weren't going to stop shooting at us just because we stopped!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Katsuragi：</span><br>
Retreat! Run for it! I don't wanna sink in a sea of flames!<br>
Isn't it way too reckless to spread oil all over your own castle and then set the freakin' thing on fire?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimakaze：</span><br>
Katsuragi, I think I might be able to do something about this...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Katsuragi：</span><br>
Do you not see that gaping, flame-belching maw from hell? No matter how fast you might be, you're not gonna make it through there!<br>
*cough* *cough*! If anything, I'll have my planes take out those mechanisms from a distance!<br>
Ugh... You worthless pieces of mass-produced metal... If you wanted to see the world burn so badly, then let me show you what a true sea of flames looks like!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimakaze：</span><br>
You've got this, Katsuragi!<br>
<br>
Katsuragi's planes plunged into the thick plume of black smoke rising from the burning fuel, but were quickly repelled by the anti-aircraft guns defending the mechanism.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimakaze：</span><br>
Katsuragi, your attacks aren't going to work!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Katsuragi：</span><br>
I can see that! Damnit, where did that anti-air gun pop out from anyway?!<br>
But, I won't be caught off guard twice! I'll just hit it with another airstrike!<br>
<br>
However, the second wave of planes were repelled by the anti-air fire as well, retreating just before there could be any losses.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Katsuragi：</span><br>
I'm not done yet! Third time's the charm!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimakaze：</span><br>
Woah, um, why don't we calm down first? I don't think a single carrier's going to be able to get through anti-air fire that dense!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Katsuragi：</span><br>
Arghh!! It's all because I can't utilize my full potential inside this cramped space! Hey, Shimakaze, don't just go rushing off on your own again! Get back here!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimakaze：</span><br>
Huuuh? Why can't I go?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Katsuragi：</span><br>
Do you have eyes?! Everything's still on fire!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimakaze：</span><br>
Fiiiiine, if you say so...<br>

Sakura Empire<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
They all disappeared inside the Dragon Palace? Chikuma, Yamakaze, all of them?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
The Dragon Palace... is it really gone now?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
...To that place I sent my planes, but... I could find no trace of them...<br>
Our counterparts in the Iron Blood said the same thing...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
What foul luck... I thought it would be safe for us to head to the Iron Blood.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
Did you request reinforcements from the home islands?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
Nay, for there may be no need... I have seen much in my dreams, of the castle beneath the waves...<br>
And though we may be in a crisis, I have also heard its calls...<br>
But more importantly, I saw... the "Commander."<br>
One who guides both the Sakura Empire and the Iron Blood equally...<br>
The importance of this person's past cannot be understated... Alas, my dreams refuse to show it to me...<br>
I beseech you, please, find the story of this one's past for me...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
I would be glad to honor your request, Shinano.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
Wait, Nagato, may I take on this responsibility?<br>
...I don't know how much Shinano has seen about the Commander, but let me tell you something important first.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
Something... important...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
Right. The reason why the Commander is able to lead ships of all factions.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
Allow me to explain. Shinano, as you already may know, us shipgirls are born from the powers of the Wisdom Cube.<br>
Humanity has been researching the Wisdom Cube since the previous war, but to little avail.<br>
...As for our rigging and gear, those are essentially byproducts made from the energy given off by Wisdom Cubes.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
Much of the military use of Wisdom Cubes followed the same process.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
Indeed. In actuality... Us shipgirls are only a small part of the Wisdom Cubes' saga.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
What?! I've been kept in the dark on this entire matter?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
Don't be so shocked. There's much I haven't even talked about yet.<br>
It is often said that Wisdom Cubes "embody the wishes of humanity," but nobody actually knows what that means.<br>
...At least, not according to the information disclosed by the Naval HQ.<br>
However, the Commander is unique for having a special "Cube Resonance" that can help us fully draw out the power from our Wisdom Cubes.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
Cube... Resonance...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
Just as we do not fully understand the true nature of the Wisdom Cubes, we also do not know about how exactly this "resonance" works.<br>
But that's not the important part. I believe that the Commander is far more than simply someone with this special aptitude.<br>
This is a person willing to treat us as human, someone able to trust and cherish us, regardless of our origins or our past. That... is what truly makes the Commander unique.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
Mikasa...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
Global affairs have become more complicated than ever, with each faction acting out of their own interests.<br>
Only the Commander is capable of re-establishing the Azur Lane that previously united the world during the previous war.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kasumi：</span><br>
Um, pardon me for interrupting, but... there's a message from the Iron Blood...<br>
A woman by the name of Strasser wants to talk about the search effort...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
...I understand. Please put her through...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
I suppose that concludes today's storytime. Maybe we'll be able to continue sometime else.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
...I have one more question... Where is the Commander now...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
Last thing I heard, there was some battle against the Sirens shortly after coming back from the Northern Parliament.<br>
Right. PH Harbor would probably be my best guess, along with that "Black Dragon."<br>

Dragon Palace - Outer Ring<br>
Suruga's group made their way to a building with a mechanism while avoiding the barrages of the mass-produced ships.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yura：</span><br>
It seems we can make some headway against those seal-protected enemies if we concentrate our firepower.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chikuma：</span><br>
Your firepower really is something else, Suruga~ Maybe I'll put in a good word for you when we get back to see if we can get you a medal~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suruga：</span><br>
Err, thanks, but it's a team effort...<br>
(Why are they looking at me though? I'm tired and just want to go home... and I hate sticking out like this!)<br>
(And, I'm starting to get sore from firing so much... Someone come save us already...)<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">???：</span><br>
Someone, please save me!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chikuma：</span><br>
Oh my, did you hear that...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suruga：</span><br>
You didn't hear anything! That was just a slip of– Wait, huh?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chikuma：</span><br>
...Are you okay, Suruga? I'll send a seaplane over to see if we can locate the source of that voice!<br>
...All right, it's coming from that direction.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yura：</span><br>
I'm seeing more of that same sealing technique. Do you think there's someone trapped in that building?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chikuma：</span><br>
Huh, I didn't expect other people to also get caught up in this mess.<br>
Whoever it is, Suruga, let's go help them!<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=Another Victim|选项=19|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=否}}
<br>
After breaking the seal, the party blasted their way through the building's entrance.<br>
Inside, they found...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chikuma：</span><br>
Prinz Eugen, from the Iron Blood?<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
The one and only. My, my, I didn't think we'd end up meeting in a place like this.<br>
Hah, I was starting to think I might have to get used to spending my entire life inside this weird castle~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chikuma：</span><br>
We also got sucked in unexpectedly... I guess that ended up being a stroke of good luck for you.<br>
By the way, who's that behind you...?<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">？？？：</span><br>
......<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Oh, this girl? Her name's Odin. She's... one of my friends.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Odin：</span><br>
......<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chikuma：</span><br>
(Whatever happened, I guess they're not on talking terms. Well, let's see if they have a better idea of what's going on first.)<br>
How long have the two of you been here for?<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
That's a good question. Let's see... That's actually a really good question...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suruga：</span><br>
(She's trying to avoid giving an answer... I don't trust her.)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimakaze：</span><br>
Chikuma, Suruga, we found a brand new kind of mechanism thing over here...<br>
Huh? Iron Blood ships? Suruga, are these the people who sent out that distress signal earlier?<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Oh right, I remember now~<br>
We were on our way to welcome the Sakura Empire's delegates, and on the way, we ran into this strange-looking castle.<br>
We decided to take a peek to see if it was safe, and as you can see, we got trapped inside the seal.<br>
I wonder what would've happened to us had you not come to our rescue~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suruga：</span><br>
(She's not acting like a victim at all...)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimakaze：</span><br>
Oh, I see, I see! Suruga, that's ridiculously good luck!<br>
You're in good hands now, Ma'am! I'm Shimakaze from the Sakura Empire, and– Owwie! Err, over here is Katsuragi. Anyway, Suruga and the others will surely guide you back to safety!<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Aha, that's quite reassurring~ I was starting to get quite bored in this cramped little corner of mine~♪<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chikuma：</span><br>
Miss Eugen, I apologize for the interruption, but I'd like to ask you something.<br>
Since you came in before us, did you find out anything about this Dragon Palace? Any information would be helpful.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Hmm, let's see... For starters, can we comfortably say that this is a Siren facility.<br>
The mass-produced ships as well as the ability to submerge such a massive building deep beneath the sea definitely bear the marks of Siren technology.<br>
Even the floating fortress you were going to visit doesn't have such a ridiculous and over-the-top functionality like that.<br>
So if we've established that this is a Siren facility, the next question is – where's the control center located?<br>
I'm just spitballing here, but... it's probably in that tall spire over in the middle of this place?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimakaze：</span><br>
Oh, speaking of which! There was some sort of weird broadcast earlier saying that anyone who reached the middle would get some sort of treasure!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suruga：</span><br>
And you're just going to believe a suspicious disembodied voice?<br>
What if there's no control mechanism at all in that central area?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chikuma：</span><br>
If it comes to that... We have to find some way to get the Dragon Palace back up to the surface.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
That's all I have for you, unfortunately. Let's do our best so that we don't have to spend the rest of our lives here~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimakaze：</span><br>
That's right, Suruga! We still have our mission to deliver Lady Shinano safely to the floating fortress!<br>
Woah! Yamakaze, don't just go running off on your own!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suruga：</span><br>
Ugh... Is anyone actually taking this seriously? Let's keep moving, I guess...<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chikuma：</span><br>
Based on what Shimakaze's told us, the only way to break these seals is to either destroy or solve the puzzle mechanisms.<br>
And if you want to destroy the mechanisms, you'll have to get through these almost impenetrable enemies to get into the right position.<br>
By focusing our firepower, we've been able to pick off these enemies one at a time.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Mm. Quite inefficient, but it works.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suruga：</span><br>
Do you have any better ideas, Miss Eugen?<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
I won't say no, since it's not like I had anything better to do other than to think about how to break out while trapped in here.<br>
Maybe I can give it a try, as a token of gratitude for rescuing me~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chikuma：</span><br>
Sounds great. But what did you have in mind?<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
You know what they say: show, don't tell.<br>
First, I want everyone to form a straight line towards that mechanism.<br>
Keep going. Good, just like that~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yura：</span><br>
Is this good enough?<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Leave a bit more space. Yes, just follow Suruga's example.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suruga：</span><br>
(But I was just trying to find a spot where I wouldn't stand out...!)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chikuma：</span><br>
So, what do we do next?<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Just give me a moment. Hmm... That should work, yes?<br>
Hmm... I wonder if you guys should stand a bit farther back just in case~<br>

{{折叠面板|标题=Rolling Thunder|选项=21|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=否}}
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Odin, are you done charging?<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Odin：</span><br>
Mm. Hull integrated. Connected. Synchronizing energy link...<br>
Herteitr's Rolling Thunder, fire!!<br>
<br>
The light inside the Dragon Palace dimmed briefly, but the brief darkness was immediately engulfed by a burst of all-consuming light.<br>
A roaring serpent of pure electricity shot forth from Odin's arm, smashing into the building.<br>
The seal crumbled before her unparalleled destructive might, the mechanism sitting atop a pedestal soon following suit, then followed by the rest of the building.<br>
The mass-produced ships began to scatter and disappear as if cowering before the loss of the mechanism.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Odin：</span><br>
Attack cycle complete. Survey the damage, Eugen.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
The target has been completely annihilated. Well done, Odin.<br>
Now then, girls, let's get moving~<br>
Oh, why aren't any of you moving? Have you taken a liking to this place?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yura：</span><br>
What in the world... was that...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suruga：</span><br>
(That attack just now... I can't say for certain, but I've never seen any main gun even come close to that level of firepower! Is this also Siren technology?!)<br>
That's an absolutely ridiculous level of firepower for a shipgirl... Does she have some kind of special rigging, or is that her power––<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Odin's just a regular shipgirl, just like me~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chikuma：</span><br>
...And one of your priority blueprint ships, right?<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
My, you're quite the knowledgeable one. But yes, that is exactly what she is.<br>
If you already knew about our blueprint ships, you could've just told me~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chikuma：</span><br>
My knowledge was pretty much just hearsay. Some things, you have to see to believe.<br>
However, such destructive power falls outside the theoretical framework of even blueprint ships, as far as I know.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
That's only something we can do once, and it's only made possible by taking advantage of our surroundings.<br>
In other words, I've already played all my cards. You'd better hurry up, or that Shimakaze girl is going to leave you in the dust~<br>

<br>
Dragon Palace - Outer Ring<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimakaze：</span><br>
Chikuma! Prinz Eugen! Is everyone okay?! The whole place started shaking and the lights even went out for a moment!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chikuma：</span><br>
It's fine~ We were just taking care of the mechanism over here.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Katsuragi：</span><br>
Huh?! That massive shockwave came from one of your attacks? You nearly made me drop my planes!<br>
Since even a full-fledged aircraft carrier like me can't make an explosion that big, we thought that you had encountered some ridiculously strong enemy!<br>
Oh, right! You didn't completely destroy the pedestal that the mechanism was sitting on, did you?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yura：</span><br>
Pedestal? Oh, I do remember seeing something like that, but... Self, mind giving me a hand?<br>
Well, um, I guess this kind of matches the description Shimakaze gave me...<br>
I have no idea how this part survived, but I guess this is– M-Miss Eugen?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suruga：</span><br>
Wait, don't just go around touching things! It might be dangerous!<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
It's fine, it's fine~ I get to play around with all kinds of Siren things~<br>
I'd say there's only a fifty percent chance of something going wrong~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suruga：</span><br>
You'd seriously gamble on fifty percent odds?!<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
If I do it like this... Oh yeah... How about right here... And look, it's done~<br>
<br>
As Eugen manipulated the pedestal, a mechanic whirring could be heard from inside.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Mysterious Voice：</span><br>
"Yes, the secret treasure of the Dragon Palace will be presented to only the brave..."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chikuma：</span><br>
Again with that secret treasure?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimakaze：</span><br>
Hwaaah?! What is this light? ...Chikuma, one of those energy barriers suddenly went up all around us!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chikuma：</span><br>
Operating this pedestal interferes with things on Shimakaze's side...?<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Yup. If we figure out how to use them properly, they'll work to our advantage.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suruga：</span><br>
*sigh*... So I guess things worked out this time. What would've happened if we lost the coin flip?<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Who knows? Couldn't be much worse than the mechanism whirring back to life and calling the mass-produced ships back again, could it?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suruga：</span><br>
(This person's way too dangerous! But...)<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Aw, what's the problem? All's well that ends well, no?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimakaze：</span><br>
Thanks for the backup, Prinz Eugen! With this barrier, we won't have any problems crossing the sea of fire!<br>
...Owwie! But, my speed... knows no limits!!<br>

Dragon Palace - Middle Ring<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yamakaze：</span><br>
Charge, charge, chaaaarge~♪<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimakaze：</span><br>
Ahaha, we're totally on easy mode now with this handy barrier protecting us~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Katsuragi：</span><br>
Thanks to the barrier, I'm not even taking any damage from short-range battles, something that has typically given me difficulty!<br>
Oh~hohoho! If the Dragon Palace's treasure is actually a device that lets us make these barriers any time we want, I'll actually become the strongest aircraft carrier in the entire world~☆<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Umikaze：</span><br>
If I may make a suggestion, we should probably leave the treasure as-is.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Katsuragi：</span><br>
Heck to the no! We've already had to fight through so many enemies and solve all these annoying puzzles! I'm not about to leave empty handed when we've come so far! Is that not so, Shimakaze?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimakaze：</span><br>
Yeah! Oh, look over there, Katsuragi! It's another mechanism!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Katsuragi：</span><br>
Just leave it to me! Fly, my planes!<br>
<br>
KABOOOOM!<br>
Katsuragi's attack made quick work of the seal protecting the mechanism's pedestal.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimakaze：</span><br>
It looks just like the same one we found earlier!<br>
I wonder if we get the treasure once we activate all of the pedestals? I can't wait to find out what it is!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yamakaze：</span><br>
I hope it's something that turns me huge! If I get super huge, I'll be able to steamroll all of Lady Nagato's enemies without even breaking a sweat!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Umikaze：</span><br>
It'd be nice if there were tasty snacks that Lady Mutsu and Kawakaze would enjoy...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Katsuragi：</span><br>
I like that gigantification idea, but what kind of treasure is FOOD? Rejected!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimakaze：</span><br>
But she has a point, Katsuragi. You know what they say, an army marches on its stomach! Food can be quite the valuable treasure.<br>
*droool*... You know, just thinking about food has really made me crave a nice carrot cake~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chikuma：</span><br>
Shimakaze, how's the situation on your end?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimakaze：</span><br>
Oh! Uhh, Team Shimakaze has safely arrived at the next pedestal!<br>
But how are we supposed to make this thing cough up the treasure...?<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
It's easy. First you do this, then reach under here... and finally, right here...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimakaze：</span><br>
I see, I see! Actually, I don't see at all!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suruga：</span><br>
Okay, alright, stop! That's where I draw the line. I'm sure YOU know what you're doing, but letting Shimakaze mess around with this stuff?<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
It's really not that bad~ If she doesn't get it the first time, I'll just explain it again~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimakaze：</span><br>
That's right, Suruga! I'm a fast learner, so I'm sure I'll get it if you show me that again!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suruga：</span><br>
*sigh*... If you keep saying stupid things, I'm going to smash this pedestal right now and leave you stuck over there.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimakaze：</span><br>
Ahhhh! That's foul play! Fine, fine, I'll get going!<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimakaze：</span><br>
Huuuh? Katsuragi, the barrier's gone!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Katsuragi：</span><br>
That's unfortunately what it looks like. If we want a permanent version of the barrier, we're going to have to find that treasure...<br>
Well, we've already made our way to the innermost part of the castle. Once we get through this area, we'll be right at the Heart!<br>
The enemies look weak, there aren't any storms, and I don't see any fire! Let's not pass up this opportunity to make some serious progress!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimakaze：</span><br>
All right, but don't let your guard down, Katsuragi! The enemy is still here!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Katsuragi：</span><br>
Who are you accusing of letting her guard down? Hmph! Any enemies that dare get in the way of this full-fledged aircraft carrier are going to get blown away in a single shot!<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chikuma：</span><br>
Shimakaze, we're about to arrive at the Heart. How are you faring?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimakaze：</span><br>
Huh?! You're about to arrive where? You didn't encounter that new type of mechanism?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chikuma：</span><br>
I don't think so.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimakaze：</span><br>
Whaaaat?! We've already run into three of them!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chikuma：</span><br>
It happens. Luck isn't something you can beat in a race after all~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimakaze：</span><br>
Ugh... My specialty is speed, and all these obstacles make me feel like I'm stuck in traffic...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chikuma：</span><br>
There's no need to feel down about it. I'll be waiting for you by the gate right outside the entrance into the tower.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimakaze：</span><br>
Ahh... You're so gentle and kind, Chikuma... *sniffle*<br>
Having all that said though, this new mechanism is really weird... I have no idea how to get past it...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chikuma：</span><br>
What kind of mechanism is it?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimakaze：</span><br>
There are a bunch of enemies in the way, and even if we defeat them, they just get right back up! There's no way for us to find the timing to get to the actual mechanism!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chikuma：</span><br>
Resurrecting enemies, huh... Maybe they're the key to solving that puzzle.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yura：</span><br>
Do you think it's some automatic repair system?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chikuma：</span><br>
It might be. Let me do a quick analysis of the enemies we've defeated so far...<br>
Nothing's coming up yet...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suruga：</span><br>
Why don't we just drag them all over to that burning sea?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chikuma：</span><br>
Oh, that's it! Thanks, Suruga!<br>
If we pull those ships over to the burning sea, we might be able to pull them out of the mechanism's effective range!<br>
Shimakaze, are you able to retreat for now and bait them back to the location of the first mechanism?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suruga：</span><br>
I was just saying the first thing that came to mind, but it's probably the best shot we've got...<br>
Although, they might not take the bait, or new enemies could appear to replace the ones that wander off...<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Sounds like your plan also has a fifty-fifty chance of success~<br>
Maybe Odin and I should head over to see if the enemies will nibble.<br>
Suruga, you and the others can stay here. I'll go bring back your cute little friend.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimakaze：</span><br>
Yes, I'd appreciate the help, Miss Eugen! Thank you too, Suruga!<br>

<span style="color:#ffd000;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Shimakaze, did you already take care of the enemies?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Katsuragi：</span><br>
That worked perfectly! The effect of the mechanism faded once we dragged the enemies out of range!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimakaze：</span><br>
The enemy reinforcements stopped as well! Did you find another mechanism on your way here, Miss Eugen?<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Sure did. That's why it took me a bit longer than expected to get here.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Mysterious Voice：</span><br>
"Congratulations on passing your trial, yes."<br>
"But, a greater challenge yet remains. Have you steeled yourselves?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimakaze：</span><br>
I'm always ready to go! Nothing's going to stop me!<br>
Chikuma, Suruga, did the two of you hear that announcement?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chikuma：</span><br>
Yes, loud and clear. By the sounds of things, we'll probably be encountering more of the same once we're inside.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suruga：</span><br>
And we're still blindly trusting this suspicious disembodied voice...?<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Maybe it's just a Siren noisemaker then? ...Hehe, you'd prefer that over some strong enemy or devious puzzle, right?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suruga：</span><br>
(I don't even want to think about how annoying this is going to be...)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chikuma：</span><br>
All right then, let's group up in front of the gate and head into the Heart together.<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=Hakuryuu's Descent|选项=27|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=否}}
<br>
The surface of the water surrounding the Heart was as clear as a mirror, reflecting the figures of the Palace's guests.<br>
It was calm. Too calm. The party was filled with suspense as it prepared for the decisive battle that was about to unfold.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yamakaze：</span><br>
Huh... Doesn't look like anyone's home.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Umikaze：</span><br>
Oh no... I'd hate to think we ruined someone's home while they were out...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suruga：</span><br>
It's just a Siren research facility. I wouldn't feel too bad if I were you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Katsuragi：</span><br>
Now, what's inside this spire? Treasure? The facility's self-destruct button? Or maybe even the controls to make the Palace resurface?<br>
<br>
The party entered the building and split up to cover more ground. Soon after, they found a pedestal resembling the structures the Palace's mechanisms were built into.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yura：</span><br>
This place feels very different from what we've seen so far...<br>
Also... I can feel a person's presence from inside that sealed structure...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimakaze：</span><br>
It seems fair to surmise that pedestal is the Palace's control center. Now the question is how we operate it...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yura：</span><br>
Um, Shimakaze? Shouldn't we wait for Eugen and Odin?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimakaze：</span><br>
You're right, we sho– Oops! I didn't mean to touch that scabbard!<br>
<br>
––––––!!!<br>
A mechanical whirr rang out from deep inside the structure, and the ground shook beneath the party's feet for a few moments.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suruga：</span><br>
Darn it, Shimakaze! What have I told you about not touching things?! Ugh... At least nothing bad happened to you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimakaze：</span><br>
I'm really sorry, Suruga... I should learn to be more careful...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yura：</span><br>
Heads up, everyone! Someone's... Someone's emerging from the sealed structure!<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">???：</span><br>
Mghh... How long have I been asleep?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Katsuragi：</span><br>
Who in the world is that?!<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">???：</span><br>
What's this supposed to be? Ah, no matter... HUMPH!<br>
<br>
KABOOOOM!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Katsuragi：</span><br>
Did she just destroy the seal?!<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">???：</span><br>
*yaaawn*... Some fresh air at last. That's the good stuff...<br>
<br>
A shipgirl appeared from within the Heart. The first thing she did was neither attack or address the party – she simply yawned.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chikuma：</span><br>
She could be a Siren Pawn... But she doesn't quite feel like one...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimakaze：</span><br>
Umm, if you don't mind me asking, who are you? Were you trapped here, like us?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suruga：</span><br>
(What are you doing, casually trying to start a conversation?! She could attack us for all we know, moron!)<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Hakuryuu：</span><br>
Who am I? I'm Hakuryuu, guardian of the Dragon Palace.<br>
And who might YOU be? You ransack the Palace, then you have the gall to awaken me?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimakaze：</span><br>
Eek! We're so sorry! We were convinced this was a Siren stronghold, and, uhh... Look, we'll pay you for the damage done!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suruga：</span><br>
(We're all guilty of messing this place up, but it's YOU who woke her up...)<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Hakuryuu：</span><br>
Splendid. Then I assume you're also ready for the consequences of rousing me from my slumber.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimakaze：</span><br>
C-consequences?! Oh no, just as I hoped I could finally get out of this place...<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Hakuryuu：</span><br>
A brat, and spineless at that, eh? You know what? I shall have you ALL take part in a trial!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimakaze：</span><br>
What... What trial?<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Hakuryuu：</span><br>
Do you want to leave the Palace? Then a trial is your ticket home. What don't you understand?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimakaze：</span><br>
Well, what do you even mean, for starters...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chikuma：</span><br>
Let me handle this, Shimakaze. Hakuryuu, what does this "trial" entail?<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Hakuryuu：</span><br>
Ah. You're her chief, huh?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chikuma：</span><br>
I'm Chikuma, Tone-class heavy cruiser from the Sakura Empire. This girl is a friend of mine.<br>
Now, are you proposing a duel of sorts?<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Hakuryuu：</span><br>
Uh-huh.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chikuma：</span><br>
And, if we win this duel, you'll let us leave the Palace, correct?<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Hakuryuu：</span><br>
Correct.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chikuma：</span><br>
...Is there nothing more to it?<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Hakuryuu：</span><br>
Nothing more to what? Just spit it out.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chikuma：</span><br>
Supposing we defeat you, should we not also receive the Palace's "treasure" and ownership of the control device?<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Hakuryuu：</span><br>
I haven't a clue what you're talking about. Just fight me already, will you?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chikuma：</span><br>
I suppose the only way we'll find out more is not by engaging her in conversation, but in battle...<br>
{namecode:175}~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suruga：</span><br>
4 pedestals... Maybe they each house a Palace mechanism?<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Hakuryuu：</span><br>
Hey! Quit whispering among yourselves! Either you come at me now, or I'll come at YOU!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suruga：</span><br>
Ugh, another hothead who's always in a rush! Fine! If it's a fight you want, then a fight you'll get!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimakaze：</span><br>
You tell her, Suruga! Show her who's boss!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suruga：</span><br>
If you think you can just cheer me on from the sidelines, think again! Get over here and help!<br>

<br>
KABOOOOM!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suruga：</span><br>
Crap! I thought she'd be strong, but not so strong she can hold her own against all of us!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chikuma：</span><br>
Suruga, I think we have to resort to using the Palace's mechanisms after all!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suruga：</span><br>
No kidding! But how do we do that?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chikuma：</span><br>
Eugen showed Shimakaze how to activate them! She'll have to do it!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Katsuragi：</span><br>
And leave me exposed?! I may be a full-fledged carrier, but I cannot hold my own in close-range combat! But if she must do it, make it quick!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimakaze：</span><br>
Roger that! Leave it to me, Suruga!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suruga：</span><br>
What about those fifty-fifty odds?!<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
You'll just have to have faith in the coin flip. Watch, Shimakaze, I'll show you one more time. First you do this... then this... aaaand... there!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimakaze：</span><br>
Okay! I've got it down to a T now! Everyone, just hang in there a little longer! I'll have all the mechanisms online in a minute!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suruga：</span><br>
Get out of there at the first sign of danger! Got it?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimakaze：</span><br>
Got it!<br>

This looks like the pedestal of rejuvenation! We'll start off with this one!<br>
What the... It's a lot harder to see once you get close to it...!<br>
Okay, do as Eugen showed you... Under there... This goes here...<br>

"The treasure of the verdant gales is only for the brave. Yes, you may proceed."<br>

This pedestal's totally new... But it should work the same way as the rest...!<br>
It HAS to work... Okay, this goes there... Now this...<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Mysterious Voice：</span><br>
"Answer me this..."<br>
"Who are your friends? Akagi's people, or the New Sakura Alliance?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:18}：</span><br>
Huh? What are either of those? Are you talking about the Great Veteran and Lady Nagato?<br>
Hmm... The way I see it... They're all my friends!<br>
I can only assume something happened between Akagi and the others, but that's not the end of the world...<br>
Disagreement between people is perfectly normal! And I know they both care deeply about us all!<br>
People can come to an understanding as long as they're willing to listen to the other side!<br>
That's what I've always believed!<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Mysterious Voice：</span><br>
"That is a brave view to hold. Yes, this treasure is yours as well."<br>

"Yes, of course. Answer me this..."<br>
"When will you consider yourself victorious? What is your ultimate goal?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:18}：</span><br>
To defeat all the Sirens and ensure the safety of our seas!<br>
That, and to bring peace back to the Sakura Empire... No, to the whole world!<br>
And to do this, I need the Palace's powers! Please, give me your strength!<br>

"Supposing the war comes to an end, what comes next for the world's shipgirls?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:18}：</span><br>
Huh? That depends on what you mean...<br>
I can only speak for myself, but I'd like to travel all around the world... Or maybe start a dojo and teach the Shimakaze fighting style!<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Mysterious Voice：</span><br>
"The question is not about you specifically, it is about what will become of all shipgirls."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:18}：</span><br>
Hmm... Well, I don't think we exist solely to fight.<br>
When we're not fighting, we all have fun hobbies to pursue. If there wasn't any more fighting for us to do, couldn't we just enjoy a life of peace?<br>
As for "what will become of us," I'm afraid I don't know...<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Mysterious Voice：</span><br>

Dragon Palace - Heart<br>
While Shimakaze searched for the mechanism's pedestal, Suruga's group was fighting a fierce battle against the defender of the castle.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Katsuragi：</span><br>
Even though Hakuryuu and I are both supposed to be aircraft carriers, I've never seen anyone fight like that before!<br>
Doesn't it seem like each one of her blows are as powerful as Odin's?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chikuma：</span><br>
Katsuragi, focus on handling your planes! We'll try to draw Hakuryuu's attention!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Umikaze：</span><br>
Oh, um... Thank you so much, Miss Eugen! You've been protecting us this entire time...<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Don't worry about it~ How could I let any misfortune befall the guests of the Iron Blood?<br>
Besides, all of you must already be exhausted from your previous battles. Get too close to that Hakuryuu, and she'll take you out in a heartbeat.<br>
Since this is a matter of life and death... I suppose I can afford to put in some effort~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suruga：</span><br>
(This woman, I swear... She was nothing like this back at the Diadem of Light! She's been holding back this entire time!)<br>
(The same with Odin! Between her and Eugen, they've fired a total of one single shot since we found them! Who are these people...?!)<br>
(And I sure hope Shimakaze doesn't mess up... If she figures out some way of bungling this, I'm going to be livid...)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chikuma：</span><br>
Suruga, we're making our stand here! Buy her as much time as possible!<br>
If Shimakaze can activate that mechanism, we'll surely have an opening!<br>

<br>
Somewhere in the Sakura Empire...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
Shimakaze, you've come back from the Siren facility?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
Good... I can see that you've brought it back, with the help of the Iron Blood...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
I never thought I'd live to see this... They brought the entire Dragon Palace back?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
"Hakuryuu"... I have heard this name uttered before.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
Was that the name of a blueprint ship? Maybe something the higher-ups haven't told us yet?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
When I was sealed inside the Sacred Tree, I would have dreams, similar to Shinano.<br>
But one such dream was very different... I don't remember what kind of dream it was, but I know I heard that name.<br>
Not just that name... But others as well, most of them unfamiliar.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
Even when the fragments are in place, even when you can see them reflected within the mirror... Only emptiness awaits your hand when you reach out. 'tis a feeling that this one knows well...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
I can't say I understand what's going on, but...<br>
We can say with confidence that Hakuryuu is a member of the Sakura Empire, right?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
This, I am sure of.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
It's just been one major incident after another since Watatsumi was swapped out...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
With Watatsumi gone, no more rituals can take place, and my dreams can no longer guide the Sakura Empire...<br>
But alas, even this one, who used to mourn being lost in the currents of fate, can surely move forward...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
Fear not. I am sure there is something we can do about the Watatsumi's fragments.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
...Shinano, it is good that you have faith, but you don't need to push yourself.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kasumi：</span><br>
Lady Shinano, the Iron Blood fleet is getting ready to depart.<br>
The others are waiting, so... if you're still planning on going...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
Thank you for letting me know...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
We will deal with the aftermath of the Dragon Palace incident, so you can continue with your trip to the Iron Blood.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
Indeed. I wish you the best of luck.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
Thank you for everything you've done...<br>

Somewhere in the Sakura Empire, months later...<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Hum, hum~♪<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Z2：</span><br>
You're in an unusually good mood today. Gross.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Of course I am. I never thought Akagi would go out of her way to prepare such a nice welcoming gift for me...<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Z2：</span><br>
...And that's a valid reason to slow down to a crawl?<br>
I'm going to have gray hairs by the time we make it back home at this rate.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
My, my, Thiele. I thought Lebe was supposed to be the impatient one. It's not like we're doing anything wrong~<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Z2：</span><br>
Didn't Akagi hatch up the plan to swap out Watatsumi as well? Don't you think she's being a bit too conspicuous?<br>
Assuming she doesn't have the entire leadership under her thumb–<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
I wouldn't put it like that, Thiele. Thanks to us, Watatsumi is safe. We did them a huge favor~<br>
Besides, if the Sakura Empire doesn't want even more things to regret... they'll have the sense to not lay a finger on us.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Z2：</span><br>
...So, how do you explain that fleet in front of us?<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
...Oh?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tosa：</span><br>
Hold, Iron Blood guest.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
If memory serves me properly... You're Kaga's other sister?<br>
So, did you have a message for me from Akagi? Or did you come to give me the instruction manual as well?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tosa：</span><br>
There seems to be some misunderstanding. I'm not Akagi's messenger.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Is that so? Whose, then?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ikazuchi：</span><br>
Someone a bit higher up? I guess you can say, someone who knows Akagi well.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Inazuma：</span><br>
We know all about what you and Z2 did at the Diadem of Light.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ikazuchi：</span><br>
I see, I see! You're using intimidation to raise that persuasion gauge! So yeah, we'd like you to come with us.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
And I assume... I don't have the option of refusing your offer?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Inazuma：</span><br>
We'd just like to have a little chat. About our "agenda," and about the future between our two factions.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tosa：</span><br>
We won't take too much of your time.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
So be it. I guess we'll see soon enough... whether it's a serpent or a demon that comes out of that cave.<br>
