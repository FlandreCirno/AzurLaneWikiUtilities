Dreamy Day in Dream Park<br>
<br>
1 At the Dream's Entrance<br>
Port - Office<br>
My desk is filled to the brim with redesign proposals for the port's amusement park. They seem to glitter under the light of my desk lamp.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Need to memorize all these ideas before Akashi puts them all together...<br>
<br>
I rub my tired eyes and try to focus on the next document.<br>
That's when, out of nowhere, I smell a floral aroma.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
What's that smell?<br>
<br>
I look up and scan my surroundings. There isn't anything that could plausibly be the source of the scent.<br>
At the same time, my eyelids start feeling really heavy.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Just a quick nap...</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：I can't sleep yet!</span>'''''<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''I slap my cheeks to try to wake myself up.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''It's no use, however. The drowsiness is too strong.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
*yaaawn*... A few minutes' sleep, then I'll get back to it...<br>
<br>
In the distance, I see a castle like something out of a fairy tale, with spires and all.<br>
The light reflecting off of them gives this amusement park a very dreamlike vibe.<br>
A lighthearted and pleasant melody plays, while the faint smell of cotton candy hangs in the air.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Crap. I must've slept until noon...)<br>
(Wait, no. Isn't this Akashi's device at work? When did she sneak that onto my person?)<br>
<br>
Amidst my confusion, a familiar voice addresses me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi(CV)：</span><br>
Welcome to Dream Park, Commander.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Amagi?<br>
<br>
Turning around, I see Amagi, standing there with a sweet yet implicative smile.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Dream Park?<br>
(This reminds me of that theory that dreams consist of what you experience during the day.)<br>
(I discussed dreams with Amagi earlier and reviewed redesigns for the amusement park, so my brain must've mashed those two ideas together.)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi(CV)：</span><br>
Heehee. While, yes, this is a dream, allow me to tell you that I am very real.<br>
Moreover, this amusement park does not merely exist in your dreams.<br>
<br>
As though she read my mind, she explains the situation with a smile.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
So what is this place, then?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi(CV)：</span><br>
You could say that it's the sum total of all our anticipation and hopes for the amusement park.<br>
I've seen how hard you're working on the redesign of our amusement park, so I took it upon myself to build this dream.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
You BUILT a dream? You can do that?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi(CV)：</span><br>
I didn't do it alone, mind you. Unzen and Shinano both lent me a hand.<br>
On another note... Have you heard of the theory that dreams are windows into the heart?<br>
<br>
I answer with a nod, and she continues her explanation.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi(CV)：</span><br>
While your brain processes designs rationally, your heart reflects ideas in their purest form.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I get it now. All you did was provide the foundation for this dream.<br>
The rest was on us. All the buildings, rides, and so on in this amusement park are made from our ideas and preconceptions, right?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi(CV)：</span><br>
Succinctly put.<br>
I would add one thing, though. It's not just the building and the rides that are a part of the dream, but the people as well.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Are you saying people might appear here not just as guests, but as members of staff as well?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi(CV)：</span><br>
Indeed.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Having to work in a dream sounds pretty bad...<br>
One question – if I redesign the port's amusement park to look like this, won't the surprise factor be completely gone, then?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi(CV)：</span><br>
Firstly, don't worry about the work part. The dream places no burden on your body or your mind.<br>
Secondly, with the exception of you and I, everyone will gradually forget everything that happens in this place.<br>
Which is to say, no, it will still be a surprise to them all.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I see.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi(CV)：</span><br>
Heehee. As much as I'd love to share in the amusement with you, I think you should first have a look around for yourself.<br>
Vacations don't come every day for you, so I hope you'll enjoy yourself thoroughly.<br>
When you wish to see me, kindly head to the castle over there. Until then...<br>
<br>
Suddenly, a whirlwind of flower petals envelops Amagi, and she disappears.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Wait!<br>
<br>
I reach out to try to stop her from leaving, but the only thing my hand catches is a single red petal.<br>
Her kind voice, however, lingers.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi(CV)：</span><br>
I wish you a pleasant stay. I'll be waiting for you at the castle.<br>
<br>
My gaze goes straight to the entrance to the amusement park of dreams.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Well, she said to enjoy myself, so that's what I'll do.<br>

<br>
Leaving Kashino's milk stall behind, I resume my walk around the park.<br>
Then, a delicious smell wafts by my nose.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Hm? What's that?<br>
<br>
Not that far from the milk stall, I see a group of girls setting up their own stands.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dunkerque：</span><br>
Oh, hello, Commander. I have freshly made pastries. Care to try one?<br>
<br>
Dunkerque smiles at me, holding a tray lined with all kinds of finely-decorated pastries.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lung Wu：</span><br>
Try these, too! They're my special-made fried noodles!<br>
<br>
The petite Lung Wu stands on a chair, working a spatula while dishing up a plate of Empery cuisine.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hu Pen：</span><br>
C'mon, Lung! You can't feed the Commander fried noodles for breakfast!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ning Hai：</span><br>
If you're gonna serve Empery breakfast, make it baozi!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ping Hai：</span><br>
Yeah! On that note – here, Commander. Fresh baozi.<br>
<br>
Ping Hai walks up to me holding a plate of steaming hot baozi. The savory smell they give off fills my nose in an instant.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Ah, the food stalls. If I remember right, these were Lung Wu's and Hu Pen's plan before Fu Shun's radical revisions.)<br>
(Looks like they unanimously agreed to bring the plan back down to earth.)<br>
(The pragmatist in me is happy, but the idealist in me is sad that Fu Shun's version didn't make it into the dream.)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vestal：</span><br>
What's the matter, Commander? The food will go cold if you just stare at it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hu Pen：</span><br>
Yeah! Breakfast is the most important meal of the day, so you gotta eat big in the morning!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cheshire：</span><br>
Owneeer! I've got morning tea just for you!<br>
I made it with lots and lots of love, and you'll definitely taste it!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">New Jersey：</span><br>
Geesh. If I'd known this would happen, I'd have made more food.<br>
That's fine, though! There's always room for dessert, honey!<br>
Once you've had your fill, come here and try my handmade ice cream!<br>
<br>
It's not long before I'm surrounded by shipgirls, all offering their food to me.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(You can't put on weight in a dream. Time to eat it all!)<br>
<br>
After chowing down all that food, I decide to move to the next area of the amusement park.<br>
But then, I hear a scream.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sakawa：</span><br>
Aaahhh! Somebody help meee!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Huh? Was that Sakawa?)<br>
(Is she in danger? But there shouldn't BE any danger in an idealized place like this...)<br>
<br>
My feet move quicker than my doubts, rushing me to the source of the scream.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sakawa：</span><br>
No! Anything but that, pleeease!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Herring：</span><br>
Just hold your nose and it'll be fiiine. Trust me, it's good.<br>
C'mon, it's fried canned herring with fermented bean curd! It's my masterpiece!<br>
<br>
I spot Sakawa and Herring off in a side alley along the food stall district.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
With fermented bean curd? Oh boy...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chi An：</span><br>
Well, well, fancy meeting you here, Commander. Care to try some of my and Herring's innovative cuisine?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Herring：</span><br>
One bite, and I promise you'll want more.<br>
<br>
Their food gives off a smell that I cannot put into words. Its intensity makes me reflexively back away.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sakawa：</span><br>
Whatever you do, do NOT eat that stuff!<br>
<br>
Even the mischievous Sakawa is trying to pull me away by the hem, a serious expression on her face. That's how you know it's bad.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chi An：</span><br>
Now, now, don't be shy! I'll even feed you. Say "ahh"!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Uh... Thanks, but I just had breakfast and I'm full.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Herring：</span><br>
If your stomach can't fit it, just a lick is good enough!<br>
<br>
As I rack my brains thinking of a way to excuse myself, Sakawa tugs on my clothes again.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sakawa：</span><br>
I'll count down from three. When I reach zero, grab my hand and hold on tight!<br>
<br>
I nod in acknowledgment, even though I have no idea what she's going to do.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sakawa：</span><br>
Okay. Three... two... one...<br>
<br>
As soon as she reaches zero, she takes my hand and runs away with me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Herring：</span><br>
Yo, wait! Where're you going?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chi An：</span><br>
Is my cooking really that bad? *sniffle*...<br>
<br>
Hearing their shouting, Sakawa kicks into fifth gear and runs even faster.<br>
We run and run, only stopping when we reach the castle near the center of the amusement park.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sakawa：</span><br>
Phew... I think we shook them off.<br>
I was just going from stall to stall, then those two weirdos cornered me.<br>
If you hadn't come by, I'd be a rotten herring by now. Heehee♪<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
So you were going around on your own?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sakawa：</span><br>
Yes? Oh, let me guess – you're wondering where Agano and Noshiro are, riiight?<br>
Heheh. I'll let you in on a secret. I'm here alone so I can have you all to myself.<br>
You break my heart, Commander. You have a sweetie like me by your side, and you're still thinking about other girls...<br>
As punishment, you're going to come with me for a little walk! Heehee!<br>
<br>
Sakawa and I go on a stroll for a while. After she lets me go, my attention drifts back to the castle at the heart of the park.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Before she left, Amagi said she'd be waiting for me there.)<br>
(I think it's time to pay her a visit.)<br>

<br>
While walking up the stairs of the castle on my way to the banquet hall, a strong wind suddenly blows open the door to a corridor.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suzunami：</span><br>
......<br>
<br>
Out of it, Suzunami steps out, wearing a fashionable dress.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suzunami：</span><br>
I was hoping you could, umm... check if I'm wearing this dress correctly or not.<br>
It's hard to do it on my own, so...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ayase：</span><br>
Don't be so unsure! You look amazing!<br>
Even my bunny is impressed you managed to put that on all by yourself!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Ditto what she said. You're wearing it right, and it looks great on you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suzunami：</span><br>
That's good to know...<br>
The banquet is starting soon, so... can I come with you?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ayase：</span><br>
Sure!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
You two go ahead without me. I'm first gonna check on the other girls and see how their preparations are going.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ayase：</span><br>
O-okay! *sigh*... I doubt anyone had as much trouble getting ready as I did...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suzunami：</span><br>
Alright then. See you later.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Talk to you soon.<br>
<br>
The girls and I part ways. I decide to look around and see how the other partygoers are doing.<br>
As I walk down the corridor, a large bell suddenly rings, signaling the start of a new hour.<br>
Just as that happens, the space around me seems to distort for just a moment before returning back to normal.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
What was that?<br>
Suzunami and Ayase should still be nearby. I'd better ask them about it.<br>
<br>
I turn back to where I came from and shout their names. No reply.<br>
Stranger yet, I follow where they went and can't find any sign that they were here.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi：</span><br>
Commander?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
What's happened, Amagi? Ayase and Suzunami just disappeared.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi(CV)：</span><br>
Kindly follow me. You will understand soon enough.<br>
<br>
I do as told and follow Amagi. We leave the castle and return to the park's central area.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
What in the world...?<br>
<br>
The surroundings are changing back and forth nonstop.<br>
One second, it's the colorful amusement park I know. The next, it's a gloomy, abandoned ruin.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
It's... It's cycling between a dream and a nightmare.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi(CV)：</span><br>
You are correct.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
So that bell I heard earlier...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi(CV)：</span><br>
Do you know what time it is now?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Based on how many times it rang and how dark the sky is... Twilight. A time the Sakurans commonly associate with misfortune.<br>
<br>
She says nothing, only nodding.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Didn't you say you built this dream, though? Why is turning into a nightmare?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi(CV)：</span><br>
Good and bad dreams cycle from one to the other, just as day and night do.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
What about Ayase and Suzunami, then? Did the nightmare take them?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi(CV)：</span><br>
"Take" isn't quite the right word. More precisely, you could say that they stumbled into the world of nightmares.<br>
They have gone to another world, which naturally means that they aren't in this dream anymore.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Seems this dream's destabilizing because of it. Just look at how everything's changing.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi(CV)：</span><br>
Yes, that is why we should look for them only after the dream has stabilized again.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(While they're gripped by nightmares...)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi(CV)：</span><br>
Are you worried about how the nightmares may effect them?<br>
Don't be. While the nightmares may be draining, those two will forget all about them when they wake up. The nightmares cannot harm them either, of course.<br>
Although, I doubt knowing that is enough to ease your concerns. You want to bring them back to our dream, don't you?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Yeah. I want them to enjoy their dreams as much as the rest of us.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi(CV)：</span><br>
I understand. Then let us look for a solution together.<br>
<br>
While we talk, our surroundings seem to finally settle on one thing.<br>
Not necessarily a good thing. Smoke rises from the ground, enveloping several of the attractions.<br>
The smoke grows thicker and thicker, eventually covering the whole amusement park. Distant buildings are rendered outright impossible to see.<br>
As I watch the place take on such an ominous look, a thought suddenly floats to the top of my mind.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Something tells me you-know-who is gonna show up any second now.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi(CV)：</span><br>
Pardon? Who?<br>
<br>
As if to answer her question, an ecstatic voice suddenly calls out from the smoke.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bristol：</span><br>
Dusk descends upon the land! The boundary between worlds grows thinner! It couldn't be any clearer – there is an outbreak of mysteries to be solved!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Holy smokes – pun intended – this is way more adventury than I imagined!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bristol：</span><br>
The adventures will have to wait. To solve this myriad of mysteries, we first need to figure out what's happening!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
See? Right on cue.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bristol：</span><br>
Heheh! I know exactly what you're thinking, Commander!<br>
"It's a mystery in and of itself how she always shows up when there are mysteries abound." Am I right?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Ahem. You two came at the perfect time.<br>
Amagi and I were just talking about how to resolve this problem and bring the amusement park back to normal.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Oh, okay! We'd better get going right now, then!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bristol：</span><br>
Wait. While I'm just as excited to solve a mystery together with the Commander...<br>
There is one thing I need to check before anything else.<br>
<br>
Bristol reaches into her pocket and digs around, looking for something.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bristol：</span><br>
Found it!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi(CV)：</span><br>
What's that? A spinning top?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bristol：</span><br>
Bingo! Now watch how it spins.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Huh... Is a top supposed to do that?<br>
<br>
A top shouldn't spin for long as it burns through its kinetic energy. And yet, this one kept spinning indefinitely, as though nothing could stop it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bristol：</span><br>
That confirms it! This is a dream. How are we here, Commander?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
It's a long story. Let me explain...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bristol：</span><br>
Ahh! I understand completely.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
So basically, we gotta deal with the nightmare and bring those two back to the amusement park, yeah?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Correct.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Then I've got the perfect name for this investigation. "Fu Shun and Friends' Great Nightmare Adventure"! Now let's–<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bristol：</span><br>
Hey! I'M supposed to name the investigation! That one sounds lame!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi(CV)：</span><br>
Heehee. You two sure are a rowdy duo.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
They sure are. Best to get used to it sooner rather than later.<br>
<br>
And so, the four of us set off to investigate the nightmarish attractions.<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=Nighttime Merrymaking|选项=4|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<br>
The nightmare has been dispelled and Dream Park returns to normal.<br>
All of a sudden, the lights come on, giving a fairy-tale-like vibe to the amusement park.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
So 'tis already night.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Watarase：</span><br>
Time flies when you're having fun, as they say.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
That it does...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
But you don't want the fun to end yet, do you?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
Ahem... You are assuming things. I implied no such thing.<br>
<br>
Nagato faces away with a blush on her face. Looks like I was spot on.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi(CV)：</span><br>
Heehee. There is still time to enjoy yourselves some more before the park closes.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
Very well... Then so I will. Commander, have you any attractions you want to go to?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
None that immediately come to mind, no. Even if I did, I want you to decide for yourselves.<br>
If you're unsure what to ride, we could follow the park map and do a tour around the amusement park.<br>
Then, when an attraction catches your eye, go for it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ayase：</span><br>
A-are you sure? Wouldn't be taking up your precious time?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Not at all. As long as you're all having fun, I don't mind giving up a bit of my time.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Oh, Commander...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Still, our time left IS limited. Shall we get going?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Everyone：</span><br>
Okay!<br>
<br>
Dream Park - Night - Water Area<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:484}：</span><br>
Oh, it was YOU who set everything right?<br>
Good job and all that. Now stay here and spend some time with me!<br>
I've been waiting all day for you, you know...<br>
It's unbelievable that you couldn't find me until now! Your only way to atone is to keep me company!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Well, well...<br>
Commander, you should know it's dangerous to swim in the pool at night. Come, let's go somewhere else.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:484}：</span><br>
Hey! Buzz off!<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：(Pacify Akagi.)</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：(Pacify Rupprecht.)</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''It's not that dangerous when others are around.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''If you just want me to go on a ride with you, I promise we'll do that later.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Heehee... Alright. I'll be patient for the time being, then♡<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Listen, Rupprecht...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:484}：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''I know. You want to say you're sorry, isn't that right?<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Fine! You're forgiven!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi(CV)：</span><br>
Ahem... I've never really played in a pool at night, let alone done so at an amusement park.<br>
Commander, won't you join us?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
I, for one, am curious to try this "Meandering Megamanjuu Dragon Slide."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Well, Commander? Both Amagi and Nagato want to try something here.<br>
<br>
Going with the flow, I get changed with the rest and give the giant slide a try.<br>
After having a blast at the water area, I dry my hair and change back into my regular clothes.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
So, what ride shall we go on next?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Watarase：</span><br>
The slide and the water fight were rather vigorous. I say we ride something more relaxing, like the merry-go-round.<br>
Conveniently, it's just up ahead as well.<br>
<br>
Everyone gives their opinions, and we collectively settle on the merry-go-round.<br>
The carousel spins along to the music at a moderate pace. Atop one of the wooden horses, a captivating figure sits.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Gloucester? Hey.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gloucester：</span><br>
Oh, if it isn't you, Master. With an entourage of Sakuran ladies, I see. Are you here to ride the merry-go-round?<br>
<br>
Gloucester nimbly hops off the horse, lands right before me, and bows her head.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gloucester：</span><br>
That was a professional stunt. Please don't try to replicate it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kaga：</span><br>
Hah. Don't do it, huh? Watch me.<br>
<br>
With a fearless grin and an acrobatic maneuver, Kaga jumps onto the still-moving merry-go-round.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gloucester：</span><br>
Miss Kaga...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi(CV)：</span><br>
Heehee. I never knew you had a playful side, Kaga.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Well... Let's get on, shall we?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
Aye. Let's.<br>
<br>
Once the merry-go-round comes to a stop, each one of us picks a horse and sits.<br>
Then, the ride slowly spins up again, going round and round at a gentle speed.<br>
As I start pondering what ride to go on next, a firework goes off in the night sky above.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ayase：</span><br>
Oh! The first fireworks round has started!<br>
<br>
Seemingly in response to that, more fireworks shoot into the sky.<br>
Their light paints everything around them in beautiful vivid colors.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ark Royal：</span><br>
There you are, Commander!<br>
<br>
Ark Royal appears out of the blue. I couldn't hear her coming since the booms of the fireworks muffled everything else.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Oh, hi. Were you looking for me?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Liverpool：</span><br>
Not just her, lots of people have been looking for you!<br>
Come on, follow us to the castle! There's no time to lose!<br>
Trust me, you won't want to miss the best part of the fireworks show!<br>

<br>
The veil of night descends, and the park's lighting shines even brighter.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
If I remember right, it should be riiight... here.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mutsuki：</span><br>
Yaaay! The spinning cups!<br>
<br>
Mutsuki jumps for joy and runs toward the attraction at full speed as soon as she sees it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Watch your step, or you'll trip!<br>
<br>
Akagi looks at me and Amagi and hesitates for a moment, then runs after Mutsuki anyway.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi(CV)：</span><br>
Heehee.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
What?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi(CV)：</span><br>
It's nothing. Seeing her like that, I just couldn't help but laugh.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
True. Also, there's a thing I've been wondering about...<br>
It started as just a vague hunch, but seeing you smile, I'm sure about it now.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi(CV)：</span><br>
Oh? What are you sure about?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
That you didn't create this dream just for me to review redesign plans for the amusement park. I'm right, aren't I?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi(CV)：</span><br>
If you feel you're certain about it, then there is no need for me to answer.<br>
You already know it in your heart. You know how I think.<br>
<br>
She looks at me with clear eyes that make no attempt to conceal a smile.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Commander! Dear sister!<br>
Come here!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi(CV)：</span><br>
Of course. I'll be right there.<br>
Let's go, Commander. Akagi and Mutsuki are waiting for us.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Right.<br>
<br>
When we arrive at the spinning cups – technically, they're honeypots, but I digress – Mutsuki's eyes already gleam with anticipation to get on.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mutsuki：</span><br>
They're like cotton candy – big, round, and sweet!<br>
I wanna ride them!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Settle down. You have to wait for them to stop first.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mutsuki：</span><br>
Okey-dokey!<br>
<br>
The attraction comes to a stop, and she boards a cup immediately.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mutsuki：</span><br>
Ride with me, Akagi!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Does it HAVE to be me?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi(CV)：</span><br>
She doesn't display this affection for you every day. Why not indulge her, right?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mutsuki：</span><br>
Yeah! Play with me, please!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Fine, if you insist...<br>
<br>
Akagi shakes her head reluctantly, then sits in Mutsuki's cup with an exasperated expression.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
We should ride it, too. Give me your hand and I'll help you get in.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi(CV)：</span><br>
Certainly. Thank you.<br>
<br>
All of us take a seat, and the cups start to gently spin around.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi(CV)：</span><br>
......<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
What's the matter?<br>
<br>
Ordinarily so calm and collected, Amagi looks both tense and confused for some reason.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi(CV)：</span><br>
Oh, it's nothing... It just occurred to me that this feels somewhat like a date between us.<br>
Although we were alone in the castle before, the mood feels quite different now than it did then.<br>
<br>
Meanwhile, in the background, the second round of fireworks begins all of a sudden.<br>
Their vivid lights illuminate the dark sky. From their light, I can see myself reflected in her mirror-like eyes.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi(CV)：</span><br>
Commander, this has been a wonderful day and a wonderful dream for me.<br>
<br>
A tinge of pink crosses her fair cheeks.<br>
She stretches out her hand and meets mine, locking fingers with me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi(CV)：</span><br>
I swear that I will never, ever leave you.<br>
Not in this perfect dream, nor in reality once we awaken.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mutsuki：</span><br>
Comainder, Amagi, what are you doing?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi(CV)：</span><br>
Ah!<br>
<br>
Caught off guard by having her name called, she instinctively tries to pull back her hands.<br>
But, after a moment's hesitation, she just wags her tails and hides our joined hands.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi(CV)：</span><br>
We're talking about the fireworks. Look, over there.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mutsuki：</span><br>
Whoa! Fireworks! So pretty!<br>
Heehee! Riding the spinning cups with the Comainder is so much fun!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
You're not with the Commander, you're with ME, remember?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mutsuki：</span><br>
Yeah, but... Hey, are you upset?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
No. Not really.<br>
<br>
The cups come to a complete stop and we get out. Mutsuki, however, still hasn't had enough fun.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mutsuki：</span><br>
I wanna ride something else!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Sorry, but we have to go home. It's closing time.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Alas, it's over already...<br>
<br>
Akagi sounds vaguely disappointed about this.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi(CV)：</span><br>
Not quite, Commander. There are a few quick things we could still do.<br>
Allow me to look after Mutsuki.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mutsuki：</span><br>
Yaaay! I get to have more fun! Heehee!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi(CV)：</span><br>
In return, please keep Akagi company.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Wait... Me?<br>
<br>
Amagi smiles and pats Akagi on the hand, then takes Mutsuki and leaves.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Alright, well... Should we go somewhere?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
(She hatched a plan so I could be alone with the Commander... Thank you, dear sister. I will not let this opportunity go to waste. Heehee...)<br>
Yes, let's! I'll gladly accompany you no matter where we're going♡<br>
Oh, but if I may make a suggestion – next time, won't you ride the Ferris wheel with me, please?<br>
There'll be no one to disturb us. We'll be all to ourselves. And then... Heehee...<br>
(Once we reach the peak of the Ferris wheel, I'll kiss you and pledge my eternal, unwavering love to you.)<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Alright. I promise we'll do that.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
It's going to be so wonderful! Hehehehe...<br>
<br>
She lets out a sweet laugh, then extends her hand and wraps her little finger around mine.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
It's a pinky promise! We've officially struck an agreement, you and I♪<br>
<br>
Her reddish tails wag joyously while brilliant fireworks burst in the sky.<br>
This moment feels like an eternity.<br>

<br>
Port - Office<br>
I wake up bathed in gentle morning sunlight. After a big stretch, I lightly rub my sleepy eyes.<br>
Memories of Dream Park are still fresh in my mind. I can still clearly remember specific details of it.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(I have so many good memories from that dream.)<br>
(But now isn't the time to reminisce. I need to go tell Akashi to stop what she's doing.)<br>
<br>
I waste no time and call the cat.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
Good morning, nya~ Anything wrong, Commander, nya?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
It's about the amusement park remodel. I came up with a new idea I'd like to move forward with.<br>
You don't need to make those demos we were discussing anymore. Get some rest.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
Nya? A new idea?<br>
Okay, nya. Then I'm gonna take a little cat nap, nya...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Sorry for canceling all of a sudden. I appreciate your work.<br>
If you need a favor, let me know.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
Nyahaha~ That's all I needed to hear, nya!<br>
<br>
I hang up, pick up the pen and paper left on my desk, and try to replicate the park I'd dreamed of.<br>
But I'm interrupted by a knock at my office door.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Come on in.<br>
<br>
A familiar friend opens the door and enters with a kind greeting.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi(CV)：</span><br>
Commander, good morning.<br>
Heehee... I see you've made your decision.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Yeah. All thanks to that dream.<br>
But I would appreciate some help nailing down a few details. I'm not sure if my idea is complete enough.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi(CV)：</span><br>
You, of all people, asking for my help? Why, I'm honored.<br>
Unfortunately, I've already brought in someone more suitable for this matter.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Oh?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi(CV)：</span><br>
Planning facilities and rides will require more detailed documentation than a dream can provide, no?<br>
<br>
Not long after, Akagi and Kaga enter with thick bundles of documents in hand.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kaga：</span><br>
Akagi and I slapped together this documentation today. Surely this should be enough.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
It's still early. If you want, I'd be happy to reorganize them again for you~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kaga：</span><br>
Akagi, is there anything you wouldn't do for the Commander?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Sure. That would be great.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Heeheehee... My pleasure♡<br>
<br>
My office is filled with the sound of rustling papers for a while.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi(CV)：</span><br>
Staring at papers all day is no good for the eyes. Commander, might I suggest a break? I can make tea and sweets for everyone.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Sounds good to me. Thank you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
By the way, Commander... I had an odd dream last night.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kaga：</span><br>
Oh? Tell us more.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Well... At first, it was a nightmare about an amusement park. But it turned into a good dream along the way.<br>
I don't remember the details, but when I woke up, I felt oddly happy.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kaga：</span><br>
Heh, what a coincidence. I had a dream like that, too. At the end of it, I think I was watching fireworks...<br>
Might be because the Commander was telling us about that park redesign plan?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I hear people tend to dream about what they thought about during the day, so it's possible.<br>
<br>
While the three of us chat about dreams, Amagi casually strolls in with a tray holding sweets and a kettle.<br>
After putting the tray down on the table, she produces teacups out of seemingly nowhere and pours tea for everyone.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi(CV)：</span><br>
What were we talking discussing?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
The dreams we had last night. By the way, did you dream at all?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi(CV)：</span><br>
Me? Hmm... Yes, I had a lovely dream.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kaga：</span><br>
Was yours about a park, too?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi(CV)：</span><br>
Indeed it was. But I've forgotten all about what happened in it...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kaga：</span><br>
Strange that all of us dreamed about amusement parks... I'll have to ask Shinano about that.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Consider that proof of just how excited we are for the park.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
You may be right. Still, that dream felt so intensely nostalgic...<br>
<br>
Amagi grins slightly and offers me a cup of hot tea. Then, she whispers into my ear...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi(CV)：</span><br>
I think everyone left with lovely memories of their time.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Agreed. All thanks to you.<br>
<br>
Our eyes meet. We smile.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kaga：</span><br>
Hm? What are you whispering about over there? You're not plotting something, are you?<br>
<br>
Kaga sounds just a tad exasperated.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Not at all. Amagi was just proposing a secret attraction. Sorry, but it stays between us... for now.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi(CV)：</span><br>
That's right, Commander.<br>
This is one secret that can't be revealed just yet.<br>

<br>
After leaving the castle behind, I go for an aimless walk around the water area.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:90}：</span><br>
Milooord!<br>
<br>
I turn to where the voice is coming from, and I see Ryuujou rapidly going down a big water slide.<br>
Just as it looks like she's going to land in the water, she leaps into the air and does a forward somersault, landing on an inflatable pool toy.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:90}：</span><br>
Behold! The Meandering Megamanjuu Dragon Slide! The most popular attraction at the park's water area!<br>
Each time I slide down it, I feel the might of the winds that grace our port!<br>
Although, I think this slide might be a little too much for you. Hmm, what else could we do...<br>
<br>
She pauses to think for a moment, then snaps her fingers like she hatched an idea.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:90}：</span><br>
I know! There's a magic show coming up, and from what I've heard, it's going to be good! Let's check it out!<br>
Follow me and I shall take you to it!<br>
<br>
Ryuujou leads me away to the performance stage situated in the water area.<br>
The front rows of the bleachers already seem to be packed with people.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Watarase：</span><br>
Ah, how nice of you to bring the Commander along, Ryuujou.<br>
<br>
Watarase stands right up and graciously bows her head to me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Watarase：</span><br>
Would you like to sit next to me? The seat is vacant.<br>
Ayase and Suzunami are with me as well, and we'd love to watch the show with you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ayase：</span><br>
Y-yeah... I think it'll be more exciting with you... The show, I mean...<br>
F-forgive me, I'm getting way ahead of myself...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suzunami：</span><br>
Here, Commander. Go on.<br>
<br>
Suzunami pats the seat between her and Watarase, urging me to sit down.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:90}：</span><br>
Very well! Then I shall sit right behind you!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Sounds good to me.<br>
<br>
I plop myself down. Watarase extends a handkerchief toward me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Watarase：</span><br>
Your hair is a little wet. I assume you just got here from the pools.<br>
Please hold still. I'll dry you off.<br>
<br>
With a smile, she pats my hair dry.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Watarase：</span><br>
There, all good now.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ayase：</span><br>
B-by the way, Commander... you'll be at the banquet at the castle tonight, right?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
There's a banquet happening?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suzunami：</span><br>
Wait, you didn't know that? Do you not have the park's schedule?<br>
I've got a spare flyer. Here.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Thanks.<br>
So after the show, there's a parade, and then that banquet at the castle... and the day ends with a fireworks display and lights show. Got it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ayase：</span><br>
That's everything! Y-you'll check them all out, won't you?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Watarase：</span><br>
I know you will. This night is to be relished.<br>
<br>
Just then, music begins to play from the stage.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z35：</span><br>
Hey, everyone! I'm Z35, the magic idol! We're gonna make miracles happen today!<br>
O, shining stars! Take my magic and passion and bring color to the world!<br>
<br>
Z35 waves her magic wand, and the stage comes alive with glamorous lights.<br>
She then recites a spell, turning water spouts into rainbows and gemstones. The crowd wows in amazement.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
Oh my gosh! That was amazing!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
Looks like they upgraded the stage tech again.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
Shush, you! Don't talk about tech when there's magic happening!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ayanami：</span><br>
Yes, those stage effects would be sweet when you're playing games.<br>
Whatever tech they have, I want it for myself.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
Me too...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
Don't be silly, you two. This is way too big for either of you to fit in your rooms.<br>
<br>
While I marvel at Z35's amazing performance, a familiar voice rings in my ears.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sheffield：</span><br>
Chosen one, please lend me your strength.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Huh? Sheffield?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sheffield：</span><br>
I'm not just Sheffield – I'm Sheffield, the magical girl maid. Come, help me take down the forces of evil.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
What forces of evil?<br>
<br>
She hardly even gives me time to react before she drags me along, bringing me up on the stage.<br>
Then, all of a sudden, she puts one of her guns in my hand.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z35：</span><br>
Commander, our hero! On my command, use the magic weapon!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sheffield：</span><br>
You heard her, Master. Prepare to take down those monsters.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z35：</span><br>
Aim for the screen and shoot the foes as they appear!<br>
<br>
It was chaotic and confusing, but with Z35's and Sheffield's help, I brought down the evil army.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z35：</span><br>
Woohoo! Amazing job, Commander! You helped us save the world!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Well, I sure didn't expect to be part of the show...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
Your courage was truly a thing to behold, Comrade Commander.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Reno：</span><br>
You were cool too, Sheffy and Z35! But will you consider adding more superhero stuff for next time?<br>
Think about it – a super magical girl hero! Double the pain for the bad guys!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z35：</span><br>
What? No! That doesn't sound cute at all!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
If lack of cuteness is the issue, how about making the villains more adorable?<br>
What if, for example, they were based on Arctic hares? Just an idea...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Casablanca：</span><br>
Yeah, let's save the brainstorming for later...<br>
Like over a bite to eat. I'm hungry. Anyone coming with me?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:90}：</span><br>
Oh, I know just the place! They have delicious food in the break area not far from here!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
We're in! We're coming with you!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Watarase：</span><br>
What about you, Commander? Are you coming?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Of course I am.<br>
<br>
And so, we all head off for the nearby break area.<br>

<br>
When I leave the break area, I spy Yamashiro running toward me in a panic.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yamashiro：</span><br>
Ah, Milord! Now isn't the time to stroll about! Hurry, hurry!<br>
You'll be late for the parade!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Hmm? The parade shouldn't be for a while, right?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yamashiro：</span><br>
Well, yes, but we won't get the good seats if we don't hurry!<br>
<br>
I follow her to the starting point of the parade, and we manage to secure good seats.<br>
The music starts as the floats drive over.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Guam：</span><br>
Whoa! Hey, Commander!<br>
<br>
Guam, star of the port, notices me. She and the other idols on the float wave at me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Taihou μ：</span><br>
Heehee, my Commander's looking at me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Noshiro μ：</span><br>
This technically isn't a real idol performance, but I must take it seriously regardless.<br>
I have to make the Commander think I'm perfect...<br>
<br>
Noshiro brushes her hair behind her ear, revealing that it's flushed a tint of pink.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vampire：</span><br>
Heheheh, thine eyes are already fixed on me!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Hmph! As the queen, my intention was to lead the parade myself.<br>
But Guam was so enthusiastic about organizing all of this... How could I refuse her?<br>
Servant! Stop sitting there and follow my float to the end. Your queen demands it!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Guam：</span><br>
Yeah! This parade won't be any fun if you don't follow along and liven things up with us, Commander!<br>
<br>
When I get up to follow, I'm interrupted by a roar from the float behind them.<br>
I turn and see a giant, dragon-shaped contraption. Blücher hangs from it by one arm.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Blücher：</span><br>
Heheh☆ Commander!<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：(Express concern.)</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：(Smile and wave.)</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''It looks dangerous up there. Do you need help getting down?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Blücher：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Heheh☆ Surprised?<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''This is just a stage effect. Safe as can be!<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''When I wave at her, her face lights up with joy.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Blücher：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Heheh♡ Do you like it? Awesome AND intimidating, am I right?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''I'll admit that it's realistic, but intimidating? I dunno.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Blücher：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Heheheh☆ Y-you don't have to be mean! Aww...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Blücher：</span><br>
Ooh, do you wanna touch it? It won't bite, I promise!<br>
<br>
Immediately after, I hear another voice from atop the float.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Devonshire：</span><br>
Role-playing mode engaged.<br>
Hmph. Bow before me, mortal, and submit to my demands!<br>
<br>
Devonshire, dressed in her greater demon outfit, looks down at me chillingly.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pamiat' Merkuria：</span><br>
Grrr... Why do I have to dress like this?!<br>
I didn't wanna be on this float in the first place! I don't even match you girls!<br>
<br>
Heedless of Pamiat's complaints, the parade marches on.<br>
I hop out of the stands and walk alongside the floats.<br>
After Guam and Blücher's floats, the third one approaches...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Indiana：</span><br>
Commander! How's about an old-fashioned Wild West showdown?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pittsburgh：</span><br>
Or you could do something a little more fun with me.<br>
<br>
A Wild West float, a demon-themed float, a fairy-tale float...<br>
The parade carries on until it reaches the final float.<br>
This one is like a moving garden, adorned with many cute ribbons, flowers, and the like.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
Commandeeer! Get on my special float, nya!<br>
Amagi prepped this Grand Premium VIP Service just for you, nya!<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：What special float?</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：Sorry, what? "Grand Premium VIP Service"?</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
It's this float right here, nya!<br>
Get on this bad boy and dance with us, nya!<br>
<br>
Akashi jumps off the float. Before I can answer, she impatiently pushes me toward it and makes me get on.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
Everyone else will be here before long, nya!<br>
<br>
After a while, the girls from the other floats all gather on this one.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Be careful not to fall, everyone!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Guam：</span><br>
Ahaha! Piece of cake for a star such as yours truly! Come on, everyone!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Come and dance with me, servant!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Taihou μ：</span><br>
My Commander, why don't you and I make some very special parade memories together?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pittsburgh：</span><br>
Heehee. You won't be getting a head start on me!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pamiat' Merkuria：</span><br>
Waaargh! Too many people!<br>
<br>
Shipgirls flood onto the float one after another.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
I hope you don't plan to leave us out of the fun!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ayase：</span><br>
Awawawa... C-Commander, I'm not good with crowds...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Watarase：</span><br>
It's okay. Don't be nervous.<br>
Commander, today's parade was a source of inspiration for me.<br>
I have the perfect idea for a new outfit for you. Don't worry – it won't be too flashy.<br>
<br>
Cheery music mingles with my friends' voices as they echo through Dream Park.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Yeah... This is a nice dream.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Watarase：</span><br>
Commander?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Sorry, it's nothing. Let's just enjoy the moment, eh?<br>
We're going to make this the best park vacation we can.<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=Fireworks and Memories|选项=9|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<br>
I arrive at the castle near the park's center. The fireworks display has reached its climax.<br>
One by one, they launch into the sky and burst into brilliant flowers of light against the backdrop of the dark sky.<br>
The streaks of red and golden light spread out and fall back down to earth like shooting stars.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suzunami：</span><br>
Wow... It's like watching stars fall...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Perseus ：</span><br>
Huh? Yeah, good analogy.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">New Jersey：</span><br>
I know there are two more rounds of fireworks, but the first one is just the most exciting one!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mutsu：</span><br>
Yeah!<br>
Look, sis! They're so pretty!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
Aye. This view is excellent.<br>
<br>
Nagato gazes up at the colorful explosions in the sky. She may not know it herself, but she's cracking a smile.<br>
SNAP!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
Whuh?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
Aww! Your smile was so cute I just had to take a pic!<br>
Man, for a polaroid, this sure looks good. Guess that comes with being a photojournalist!<br>
Check it out, Commander!<br>
<br>
Alfredo waves her polaroid camera around and hands me the developed photo of Nagato.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：You're right. That's a cute smile.</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：Yeah, this looks really good.</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
Heehee! I knew you'd agree!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
C-Commander... *blushes*<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(It's a shame we can't bring this photo with us. It's just a dream, after all...)<br>
<br>
I turn and look at Amagi. She gives me a nod with a sorry look.<br>
Before I know it, the first fireworks round starts coming to a wrap.<br>
One final dense column of fireworks shoots up, painting a wonderful picture in the sky.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
What? It's over already? I thought there was gonna be a lights show.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
That's what I was told as well.<br>
<br>
DING!<br>
Right then, all the lights shining on the castle go out save for one corner of it, leaving it pitch black.<br>
A moment later, lights and shadows start dancing on the castle's surface, reenacting some good old memories we've had.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Unzen：</span><br>
Are these... the times we've spent together over the years?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Clemenceau：</span><br>
Seabreeze Island, the hot spring, the Wild West town, and the cruise ship...<br>
My, my. Whoever planned this show put a lot of thought into it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Flasher：</span><br>
*sniffle*... All the fun things we've done... *sniffle*...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Épée：</span><br>
D-don't cry... *sniffle*... or you're gonna make me cry as well...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Guam：</span><br>
Hahah! All that footage I took came in handy!<br>
After all that fun we had earlier, now we can look back on the sweet memories of the past.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi(CV)：</span><br>
Yes. These memories remind us that even ordinary days spent with the Commander are precious and worth remembering.<br>
<br>
The lights and shadows continue changing, synching perfectly with the music. Together, they recite some wonderful stories.<br>
Gradually, the light grows in intensity, illuminating not just the castle but also the smiles on the faces of everyone around me.<br>
Finally, a special firework bursts in the sky, bringing the lights show to a perfect close.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ayase：</span><br>
Wow... That was incredible...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Watarase：</span><br>
Heehee. It was truly a one-of-a-kind experience.<br>
Having said that, I will still watch the second and third rounds of fireworks. The first round gave me some ideas.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Then I suppose we could each do whatever we want next.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mutsu：</span><br>
Okay! I wanna stay and watch more fireworks! I wanna find better seats for the next round!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Essex：</span><br>
Then I have a good idea for you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Oh, really? Tell us!<br>
<br>
The girls discussed things they had to do before the park closes, then went their separate ways.<br>
However, at least one of them remained in the central area.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mutsuki：</span><br>
Comainder! I wanna go on more rides!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Really? Aren't you tired?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mutsuki：</span><br>
Nuh-uh! This fun park is great!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Alright, then let me think...<br>
(It must've taken Amagi considerable energy to build this dream, and Akagi's stay in the nightmare must've been draining.)<br>
(Those two must be exhausted by this point.)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi(CV)：</span><br>
Are you wondering if me and Akagi have enough stamina to continue?<br>
Rest assured, I still have the energy and the will for some more.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Likewise. I've not had enough yet.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mutsuki：</span><br>
Yippee! Let's have fun!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Well, that's good... Me, though, I'm going to need a less-taxing attraction.)<br>
<br>
I skim the list of attractions I've seen, and I find a suitable one.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Here we go. Let's check out this one.<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=In the Maze|选项=10|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<br>
I open the door to the haunted house. A spherical object radiating a strange light in the dark immediately catches my attention.<br>
The sphere rises and falls as though it were breathing, then the light dims and the silhouette of a person appears inside the sphere.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Is that... Akagi?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi(CV)：</span><br>
Oh dear. It looks like she wandered into the nightmare as well.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bristol：</span><br>
I don't see her. Where is she?<br>
<br>
I point at the floating sphere. Bristol shoots me a confused look in response.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bristol：</span><br>
What? There's nothing there except a maze.<br>
Do you see Akagi, Fu Shun?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Nope. Also, that's no maze, that's a kitchen.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
A kitchen? We're all seeing completely different things here.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi(CV)：</span><br>
The nightmare is causing this. Perhaps what you see are your deepest fears.<br>
Of course, I'm only speculating here.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bristol：</span><br>
Well, I don't know where Akagi is, but I sure think we should hurry up and save her.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Yeah, but how?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
How, indeed...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi(CV)：</span><br>
There are two ways to deal with a nightmare, Commander. Do you know them?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Waking up Akagi, or turning this into a sweet dream, right?<br>
<br>
As we talk, a small orb of light appears ahead of us, then flies off somewhere inside the building.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
What was that?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi(CV)：</span><br>
That was the fragment of a sweet dream.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
So if I got that right, a person's sweet dreams will turn into fragments the longer they're stuck in the nightmare.<br>
Which is to say, wake her up, and those sweet dreams will be gone.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi(CV)：</span><br>
Yes. Yes. Our only option is to break up the nightmare.<br>
Everything should work out if we just collect all the fragments and bring them to her.<br>
The nightmare should vanish by itself once her dreams turn pleasant again.<br>
Doing so will also make the park go back to normal.<br>
However, I must admit manipulating dreams isn't my strong suit, and my conjecture could be wrong.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Well, it's the best we've got right now.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bristol：</span><br>
Dreams this, dreams that – all we need to do is gather more of that spooky thing we saw, right?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Hey, it wasn't spooky! She just said those are fragments of a sweet dream!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Right. Let's go, but keep your eyes open.<br>
<br>
Our search begins in earnest, and we soon find out that neither Fu Shun nor Bristol are affected by what they're each seeing.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
That totally looked like a dead end, but I could phase right through it!<br>
It was exciting, not knowing if I'd slam into it or not. Honestly, this is pretty fun!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bristol：</span><br>
We're literally in a nightmare, and you're treating it like an adventure?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Duh! There are adventures everywhere for those with the eyes to see!<br>
<br>
While Fu Shun explains with glee, a glowing object appears from a corner of the house.<br>
The object slowly floats through the air, landing in Fu Shun's hand.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi(CV)：</span><br>
Ah, it seems the fragments respond to positive emotions. Commander, are you thinking what I'm thinking?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Sure am. Let's give it a shot.<br>
<br>
We take this hint and try all kinds of things to bring out positive feelings.<br>
We recall fond memories, we whistle gentle songs, and more. One after another, the fragments respond, drifting toward us.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi(CV)：</span><br>
I know these fragments... This is from when Akagi ate dango with the Commander, when they watched the flowers bloom, when they went to a banquet... When they had tea, when they laughed together...<br>
A sweet dream, to her, must be recalling those precious memories.<br>
Let's give them back to her now.<br>
<br>
Once all the fragments have been collected, I ask Bristol and Fu Shun to wait at the entrance while Amagi and I head to our destination.<br>
Amagi holds up the fragments with her hand, and they quickly float toward the sphere of light that Akagi is trapped inside.<br>
The fragments all hover in the air in unison, then fade away into nothingness.<br>
Freed from the sphere, Akagi comes falling down. I immediately spread my arms to catch her.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Ah... Commander...?<br>
<br>
She slowly opens her eyes in my arms, a look of confusion on her face.<br>
A second later, she seems to remember something and frowns.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Ugh... I came to the haunted house for a fun time, and somehow, I blacked out...<br>
And then, I had this strange dream...<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：(Soothe her with words.)</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：(Soothe her physically.)</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''It's alright. The nightmare is gone now.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''How, indeed...<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''She responds needily, squeezing my hand tightly with hers and not letting go.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''I pat her on the head, trying to get her to relax.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''As soon as I stop, she squeezes my hand tightly with hers and not letting go.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi(CV)：</span><br>
Ahem.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
A-Amagi?!<br>
<br>
Realizing that her sister is here, she promptly lets go of my hand.<br>
She then straightens her clothes out quickly and asks about what is happening at the port.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Well...<br>
(The only ones aware that this is a dream are me, Amagi, Bristol, and Fu Shun.)<br>
(I don't know if I should tell her the truth...)<br>
<br>
Amagi senses that I'm hesitant to answer. She leans in to whisper into my ear.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi(CV)：</span><br>
Don't worry. It's okay for her to know.<br>
<br>
She explains the situation on my behalf. Once that's over, we turn around to regroup with the other two.<br>
As we're walking, Amagi leans in again to whisper to me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi(CV)：</span><br>
It doesn't matter who finds out that this is a dream. Everyone but you and me will forget about it.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Oh. I'm guessing that's why you didn't stop me when I explained it to Bristol and Fu Shun.<br>
I worried for nothing, then.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi(CV)：</span><br>
Heehee. That you did.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bristol：</span><br>
Look! They're back!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Great, there's more of you...<br>
Whatever. I'll deal with it until this nightmare business is over.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
So, that's that for the nightmare in this area, right?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi(CV)：</span><br>
Yes. We should start heading to the next one.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bristol：</span><br>
Alrighty! Off we go!<br>

<br>
Almost as soon as we enter the area and pass by a stall, I spot an ominous tunnel in the middle of nowhere.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bristol：</span><br>
Now THAT'S an eerie phenomenon if I ever saw one!<br>
A tunnel into the darkness, so dark it won't even let light through! And in that darkness, an unspeakable terror lies in wait!<br>
Each step forward – one step closer to everlasting insanity!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Asanagi：</span><br>
Gah! Speak not of such frightening things!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Uzuki：</span><br>
Waaahhh! I don't wanna be here! I wanna go hooome!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ark Royal：</span><br>
Now, now, don't be afraid! Bristol is just running her mouth. She is, right, Commander?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Yeah. She's just saying things.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Épée：</span><br>
B-but... Nagato and some others went in earlier...<br>
And they still haven't come back...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
What? Nagato went in? Why did she do that?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ark Royal：</span><br>
Let me explain. Before it went dark, I brought a bunch of destroyers here to ride the miniature railway.<br>
We ran into Nagato and her friends, who were going to do the same.<br>
Then, the bell rang, and this tunnel suddenly appeared right in front of the train.<br>
They said it looked dreadfully suspicious, and rode the train inside to investigate. So I was left here to guard the little destroyers.<br>
<br>
With perfect timing, the speakers suddenly play the sound of a train whistle, and the miniature train emerges from the tunnel.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Épée：</span><br>
Are... Are they back?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi(CV)：</span><br>
No... There's no one on the train.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I'd wager that there's another nightmare in that tunnel, like what got Akagi.<br>
Ark Royal, you stay here and watch the destroyers. The rest of you, come with me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ark Royal：</span><br>
I'm going to have to say no. I'm coming with. Resolving this situation comes before anything else.<br>
If you need someone to look after the little destroyers, well...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mogador：</span><br>
Mmh... While I may teeechnically be a destroyer myself, I could definitely look after them for you.<br>
<br>
After leaving the destroyers in Mogador's care, I board the tiny train with Ark Royal.<br>
The whistle blows again, and the train chugs along into the dark tunnel.<br>
Once we're inside, the lights that run parallel to the train tracks suddenly go dark.<br>
Everything instantly goes pitch black and the train slows down significantly, like a person groping around in the dark.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bristol：</span><br>
Whoa, it's as dark as anything! You know what this mood is perfect for? A ghost story!<br>
<br>
Bristol lights her lantern and shines the light up right below her face.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bristol：</span><br>
It was a dark, dreary night, and the old floorboards creaked with a spine-chilling sound...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Stop! No more!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bristol：</span><br>
Why? Scared?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
N-no! I just think we should focus on fixing this nightmare problem!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bristol：</span><br>
Fair enough. Commander, should we get off?<br>
<br>
The lantern in Bristol's hand swayed slightly as she moved. It wasn't the only thing that swayed.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ark Royal：</span><br>
Huh? Did the train just shake a little?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Yes, I could feel it.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Strange... The train swayed at the same time as her lantern. Maybe it's a coincidence, or maybe...)<br>
Bristol, turn your lantern the other way.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bristol：</span><br>
Oh, sure!<br>
<br>
She faces her lantern in a direction, and sure enough, the locomotive changes angles accordingly.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I knew it wasn't a coincidence.<br>
I wonder if the light's brightness affects the train's speed. That would explain why it's going so slow right now.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi(CV)：</span><br>
Illuminating the tunnel may perhaps even deconstruct the nightmare and solve everything.<br>
<br>
All of a sudden, the train comes to a stop.<br>
The door slides open without a sound. Heavy, cold air rushes in from the tunnel.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Let's get off.<br>
<br>
Relying solely on Bristol's lantern, we move through the darkness and find Nagato's group, lighting the way forward by burning shikigami.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
It's you. We've learned some things...<br>
<br>
Nagato proceeds to explain her findings and theories about the tunnel.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
If we want to investigate deeper – or escape, for that matter – we'll have to either get the train moving or light up the whole tunnel.<br>
And if we don't get the train moving, getting out is going to be a tall order.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mutsu：</span><br>
We haven't found a way out, but we DID find a really special place while searching around!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimanto：</span><br>
That, we did. We haven't been able to light it up, despite trying everything.<br>
All we can make out of it is a faint, round contour.<br>
Come with me, Commander. I think you'll get it when you see it.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Lead the way.<br>
<br>
Shimanto guides me to the strange place they've been unable to illuminate no matter what they did.<br>
There's a sphere enveloped in a strange light, flickering. Inside it, the faint silhouette of a fox-eared girl.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Looks like it's Kaga this time.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
Come again? You can see through this darkness?<br>
<br>
I quickly explain the situation to them, then set about trying to free Kaga from the nightmare.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Oh, it's this again. All we gotta do is bring out positive emotions and the fragments will come to us.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ark Royal：</span><br>
Is it really that simple? If so, I'll start thinking positive thoughts right away!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Yeah! Adventuring is so fun! I love going on adventures!<br>
...Where are the fragments? Was I not positive enough or something?<br>
<br>
The tunnel remains as dark as ever, with no sign of any sweet dream fragments appearing.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bristol：</span><br>
Oookay then. It's not the same as with Akagi.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi(CV)：</span><br>
Seems so...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Well, if that's off the table, I'll just have to wake her up.<br>
<br>
Kaga's eyes are firmly shut and her brow furrowed. She's clearly having a nightmare.<br>
What's more, the light around her begins to flicker even more intensely and rapidly.<br>
The tunnel, meanwhile, is only getting darker and darker.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
This reminds me... While I couldn't make out the words, I heard a voice speak to me while I was asleep.<br>
Maybe she can hear what we're saying right this moment.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Then I know a way to wake her up.<br>
<br>
I ask everyone else to stand back, then I slowly approach the nightmare sphere.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Kaga, do you remember the time when...<br>
<br>
I recite a series of happy memories to her. Her expression becomes notably more relaxed.<br>
At the same time, the darkness surrounding the tunnel fades away. Once the light of the setting sun shines in, Kaga slowly opens her eyes.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kaga：</span><br>
I just had a terrible dream...<br>
But, just as it was getting to me, I heard your voice. It calmed me.<br>
Thanks to that, my dream went back to good again.<br>
<br>
The soft sunlight caresses her cheek, and her lips curve into a faint smile.<br>

<br>
With Kaga freed from her nightmare, our "detective team" has grown quite big now.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
There's one final aberration. This should be it.<br>
<br>
The Ferris wheel. Its paint is flaking off and its metal frame has rusted to a horrendous degree.<br>
The cabins, faded and discolored, sway dangerously, like they'll detach and fall down any minute now.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(I knew something was wrong with the Ferris wheel ever since the haunted house.)<br>
(It ended up last on our list, though, because Fu Shun and Bristol led the team.)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bristol：</span><br>
It's like eating strawberry cake and being unable to decide whether to eat the strawberry or the cake first.<br>
Me, personally, I start with the cake!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shoukaku：</span><br>
Oh, hello. Are you here to ride the Ferris wheel?<br>
I'm sorry to say, but I don't think it's in a rideable state.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
It was normal just a minute ago, then it changed to look like... this.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shoukaku：</span><br>
Say, Akagi, why don't you ride it first?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
You JUST said it doesn't even look rideable.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shoukaku：</span><br>
Aww. I thought you were going to prove me wrong. I expected too much!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
......<br>
<br>
Just as Akagi is about to hit back with a retort, Yuubari appears out of nowhere.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yuubari：</span><br>
Hmm... This isn't quite working out.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
What are you doing, Yuubari? Trying to fix the Ferris wheel?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yuubari：</span><br>
Whuah! You startled me, Master... Good timing, though!<br>
Yes, I'm trying to get it up and running again. Tosa is still on it, you see.<br>
<br>
She exhales a sigh and points to the cabin at the very top of the wheel.<br>
I look up and can just about make out the figure of a person inside it.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
It's Tosa who's having a nightmare this time, eh.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi(CV)：</span><br>
No, not quite.<br>
She isn't sleeping, she's simply stuck up there.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tosa：</span><br>
Hey! You down there!<br>
How long are the repairs going to take?<br>
<br>
Tosa's voice is only barely audible.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Seeing as she's wide awake, someone else must be afflicted by the nightmares, then.)<br>
(But who?)<br>
<br>
As I ponder the question, a blue butterfly flies toward me.<br>
It circles in the air for a while, then lands on my nose.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
To be in a dream is no different than being trapped in a dream...<br>
My hint is this: "only the one who tied the tiger's bell may untie it."<br>
<br>
Shinano's voice echoes from somewhere, though she herself is nowhere to be seen.<br>
After giving me her hint, the blue butterfly takes off from my nose and flies away.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Untie the tiger's bell... No different than being trapped in a dream...)<br>
I've figured it out.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi(CV)：</span><br>
If I may ask, why have you been staring at me this whole time?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
The Ferris wheel is like this because of you. You're the one having a nightmare.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi(CV)：</span><br>
Me?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
You, dear sister?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Oh! Here it comes! My second most favorite part – explaining the mystery!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fleuret：</span><br>
And what's your number one?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
The adventuring part, obviously!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fleuret：</span><br>
I don't know what I was expecting...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Ahem.<br>
<br>
I clear my throat to stop the conversation from derailing any further.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Amagi, you created this dream, and you're aware that you're dreaming.<br>
If you couldn't fall asleep in your own dream, the nightmares wouldn't have occurred to begin with.<br>
We know there's an aberration here, but we don't know who's being affected by the nightmares.<br>
Therefore, it stands to reason that you've been subconsciously influenced by the nightmares all this time.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi(CV)：</span><br>
So that's how it is... I had no idea I was being influenced.<br>
Come to think of it, something has been unnerving me ever since twilight set in... I didn't expect it to influence the dream on this scale.<br>
At least now we know what's causing the nightmares...<br>
<br>
Amagi smiles and holds my and Akagi's hands.<br>
She bows to everyone gathered, thanking and apologizing to them at the same time.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi(CV)：</span><br>
Commander, Akagi, Kaga, and all the rest of you...<br>
Thank you for being here for me. It puts me at ease.<br>
The time you share with me is the most precious thing I could ask for.<br>
Let us rid ourselves of the nightmares and restore this beautiful place to what it once was.<br>
<br>
As the final words leave her mouth, the rusted and busted Ferris wheel regains its luster and starts moving again.<br>
The ominous smoke around the park vanishes, and everything becomes clear again.<br>
A minute later, the Ferris wheel completes its cycle, and Tosa safely exits.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tosa：</span><br>
I feared I'd be stuck up there forever, heh. Glad to be back on the ground.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi(CV)：</span><br>
Heehee. Perhaps you'll ride it again, though.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tosa：</span><br>
What does that mean?<br>
<br>
Just like that, a cabin massive enough to fit everyone standing here appears on the Ferris wheel.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi(CV)：</span><br>
Seeing as we're all here, why don't we ride it together?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yuubari：</span><br>
Hmm. From an architectural engineering point of view, this attraction should never be able to support such a cabin...<br>
But what does it matter? This is a dream.<br>
<br>
The huge cabin finally reaches the peak of the wheel.<br>
The bell tolls, signaling the start of night. One by one, the lamps around the park light up.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Whoooa! Look at that view!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mutsu：</span><br>
Look, Nagato! Over there!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
Aye, I see it. Truly a spectacular view.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bristol：</span><br>
Hey, remind me – why are we on the Ferris wheel, again?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Yeah. It feels like we got dragged aboard for the sake of a climax or something.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ark Royal：</span><br>
Who cares about the why and how? Just enjoy the amusement park for what it is!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Thanks for all this, Amagi.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi(CV)：</span><br>
Heehee. I should be the one thanking you. I'm so happy to have been here with you and everyone else.<br>
<br>
With the nightmares all gone, the amusement park is filled with voices of jubilation.<br>
The dreamy days in Dream Park are sure to continue for a long time.<br>

{{折叠面板|标题=Nice and Cold Milk|选项=13|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<br>
As I'm walking around the amusement park, I come across Kashino, selling milk at a stall.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:188}：</span><br>
G-good morning, Commander.<br>
<br>
She bids me good morning, holding a sign and wearing airy clothes.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:188}：</span><br>
Can I interest you in some milk?<br>
It's cold, delicious, and freshly squeezed just this morning. Try it!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Don't mind if I do.<br>
<br>
She puts down her sign and picks up an empty bottle.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:188}：</span><br>
Ahh! Ow, oww...<br>
<br>
But, just as she starts filling it, she hits her foot on something.<br>
She recoils from the pain, and milk spills everywhere.<br>
As she frantically tries to salvage the situation, she loses her balance and seems on the verge of falling over.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：(Rush to her aid.)</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：(Catch her.)</span>'''''<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''I run over and wrap my arm around her waist, stopping her fall.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''While she staggers, I quickly reach out to catch her.<br>
<br>
Her body feels supple in my hands, and her skin feels warm from the sunlight.<br>
She leans on me to steady herself then looks up at me.<br>
Caught off guard by this sudden contact, she has a deep red blush spanning from ear to ear.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:188}：</span><br>
Th-thanks for helping me...<br>
The stall is pretty small, and my view gets blocked often. It's easy to knock things over...<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：I'm just glad you're okay.</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：You need to be more careful.</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:188}：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Thanks to you! If not for you, I really would've fallen over.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Carelessness like that will get you hurt, and we don't want that.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:188}：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''You'e right... I'll try to be more careful!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:188}：</span><br>
*sigh*... Now I need to clean up this spilled milk.<br>
<br>
Still blushing, she steps away and takes out a cloth to start cleaning the stall.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Need any help with that?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:188}：</span><br>
Oh, thanks, but I can do it myself! No need to go out of your way for me.<br>
<br>
Not taking no for an answer, I pick up a cloth of my own and help her clean up anyway.<br>
Once the stall is tidy again, Kashino produces a new bottle and pours fresh milk into it.<br>
She ties a cute little ribbon around the bottle's neck, then gives it to me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:188}：</span><br>
That's everything♪<br>
Here you go, Commander. I hope you enjoy it!<br>
<br>
I take the bottle and chug her milk in a matter of seconds. It really drives the summer heat away.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
You weren't kidding. It IS delicious.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:188}：</span><br>
Whew. I'm glad you like it!<br>
<br>
A satisfied smile appears on her lips. She has forgotten all about the stress and embarrassment of her accident just a minute ago.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:188}：</span><br>
If you need a break from the amusement park, or if you just feel thirsty, please feel free to come back♪<br>

<br>
After stepping inside a castle at the amusement park, I'm drawn to a particular door by the floral aroma coming from the other side.<br>
I open the door and walk down a long corridor, candles on the side igniting with each increment forward, lighting up the dark room.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi(CV)：</span><br>
Welcome, Commander. I've been awaiting you.<br>
The candlelight shines on a throne at the opposite end. Upon it, Amagi sits.<br>
Before you begin your investigation, I'd like you to come here and rest for a while.<br>
She takes her scepter and softly taps on the floor with it.<br>
Out of thin air, this produces a table lined with comfortable-looking chairs and an assortment of tea and treats.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
Well, I'm not one to refuse another's hospitality.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi(CV)：</span><br>
I take a seat and help myself to the refreshments she's offering. Then, a while later...<br>
Heehee. Have you had your fill? Are you going to start your investigation now?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
Yeah.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi(CV)：</span><br>
Hearing my answer, she smiles contentedly.<br>
Very well.<br>
CLICK!<br>
A door in the room just locked.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
Huh?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi(CV)：</span><br>
This is your first investigation – how to unlock the door and leave.<br>
I'll give you a clue – the key is on my person. Won't you come closer and investigate?<br>
Doing as she asks, I approach her. I examine her beguiling smile while I ponder where the key might be.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Is it in your tails?</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：Is it under your clothes?</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项3：Is it inside your scepter?</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi(CV)：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''It isn't. Are you not just pining for a tail to fluff?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''(So it's not in her tails. In that case...)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi(CV)：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''How could it be, when there is scarcely any clothes to hide it under? No, it is not.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''(So it's not under her clothes. In that case...)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi(CV)：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项3）</span>'''''Heehee. Well, why don't you take it and check for yourself?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi(CV)：</span><br>
Assuming that means I have permission, I place my hand on the scepter and try to take it, but she won't let me.<br>
I am the lord of this castle. I will not simply GIVE it to you.<br>
There is suddenly a sharpness to her gaze. She holds the scepter firmly to prevent me from snatching it.<br>
The silent struggle between us continues, her scepter brushing against her tidy clothes and creating wrinkles all over.<br>
As we keep going, she starts panting and her cheeks turn red.<br>
Commander...<br>
CLING!<br>
Our miniature tug-of-war is interrupted by the sound of metal hitting the floor.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
Wait... Was that the key?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi(CV)：</span><br>
It seems I accidentally pressed the scepter's key release mechanism amidst our little scuffle.<br>
Heehee. As you surmised, it was indeed hidden inside the scepter. You just had to press in the right spot and the gem at the top would come loose, letting the key out.<br>
Now that you have the key, the next step to continuing your investigation is to leave this place with me.<br>
Rising from her throne, she brushes her fluffy tails against the flowers decorating the room.<br>
An intense floral aroma forces its way into my nostrils, making me rub my nose with my hand.<br>
What's the matter? Are you feeling cold?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
No, it's just the flowers. They have a strong scent.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi(CV)：</span><br>
I'm sorry about that. I'll use less flowers in the future.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
It's fine. Also, now that you mention it, it DOES feel a bit cold in here.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi(CV)：</span><br>
Heehee. Fortunately, I know just the thing to warm you up.<br>
She enacts her plan, folding her arm around mine and pressing up against me, sharing her body heat.<br>
Let's stick close, Commander.<br>
It'll be much warmer this way.<br>

<br>
Leaving the water park, I return to the break area.<br>
There, I find the impeccable and fashionable head maid, Belfast, who has been waiting for me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Belfast：</span><br>
Welcome back, Master.<br>
There is an iced beverage ready, if you'd like to cool down. Please wait just one moment and I'll get it for you.<br>
<br>
She gracefully brushes her hair up, then brings out the cold drink.<br>
But then, in an uncharacteristic fashion for the maid prepared for anything, a bothered look forms on her face.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Belfast：</span><br>
Well... This is troublesome.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
What's the problem?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Belfast：</span><br>
You see, Miss Hyuuga asked to borrow my opener earlier, and I obliged.<br>
She should have given it back by now, but it seems she forgot to.<br>
I'm afraid that if I go to reclaim it now, it's going to take quite some time. This will undoubtedly change the beverage's texture.<br>
Therefore, I am left with no choice but to open the bottle through some other means.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
"Other means"?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Belfast：</span><br>
Yes. Master, would you mind standing back a bit?<br>
<br>
As she asks, I take a few steps back.<br>
She strikes some sort of ready pose, then with a lightning-quick maneuver...<br>
POP! FSSHHH!<br>
The bottlecap flies off, and a sweet aroma fills the air.<br>
A splash of liquid hits her dazzlingly fair skin, leaving a faint red trace on it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Belfast：</span><br>
Please enjoy, Master.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Thanks.</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：How in the world did you do that?</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Belfast：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''You're welcome. This is only a maid's job.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Belfast：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Heehee. I'm pleased to see you were surprised.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Let's not get hung up on bottle-opening techniques. Please have a taste.<br>
<br>
I walk back up and accept the bottle from her. That's when I notice that she's faintly blushing.<br>
The sunlight coming in from the glass ceiling shines on her, highlighting every little bead of sweat on her skin.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Ah... This place is scorching. Now I feel sorry for keeping her waiting so long.)<br>
Hey, why don't you have a drink, too? It's pretty hot in here.<br>
<br>
Not giving her the chance to be humble, I take a glass, fill it, and offer it to her.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Also, you could probably use a break.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Belfast：</span><br>
Heehee. I appreciate it, Master, but I am not tired. Waiting for her master is but one of a maid's many duties.<br>
Of course, I do understand your concern. Thank you kindly.<br>
<br>
She takes the glass. I extend mine to offer her a toast, and she reciprocates.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Belfast：</span><br>
Cheers. I sincerely hope you'll have a wonderful day at the amusement park.<br>
Then, later on, in the event that you feel tired...<br>
<br>
The well-spoken Belfast suddenly trails off before looking at me with a slightly cheeky smile.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Belfast：</span><br>
Then we may discuss having a break. Heehee.<br>

<br>
BANG! BANG!<br>
Following the sound of gunshots, I end up at a shooting gallery stall.<br>
There, I find Musashi with a water gun, scoring every single hit on a series of moving targets.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:84}：</span><br>
Ah, it's you. Splendid timing.<br>
<br>
Next to her, there are two entire piles of stuffed animals she has won as prizes.<br>
I step closer, and she addresses me again.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:84}：</span><br>
The children said they wanted these, so I'm giving them what they desire.<br>
What about you? Are there any prizes that you want?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Not really. If you win any more, just give it to them.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:84}：</span><br>
I see. Then this is enough target practice for one day.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(She looks a bit disappointed all of a sudden. Hmm...)<br>
While I'm not after any prize, I wouldn't mind a little competition with you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:84}：</span><br>
A good idea. However, it would be rather dull to compete merely over who gets the most points.<br>
As this is a rare opportunity, what say you we make a wager?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
What kind of wager?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:84}：</span><br>
The loser must do any one thing that the winner demands of them.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Alright. I can do that.<br>
I want some time to get used to this gun's handling, so how about you go first?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:84}：</span><br>
Heehee. Very well. The first move is mine, then.<br>
<br>
Our first round was a tie, so we ran again... and again, and again. Our scores are now evenly tied once more.<br>
A series of shots from our respective guns knock down every target, save for one last one.<br>
All I need to do is hit this final target to win.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:84}：</span><br>
Make your shot count, Commander.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：(Focus and take the shot.)</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：(Lose on purpose.)</span>'''''<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Aligning my sights with the target, I squeeze the trigger. A beam of water knocks the target down. Victory is mine.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:84}：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Congratulations. You were a worthy opponent.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''As promised, I will agree to any request of yours.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Whatever you wish, I shall make it happen.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''(Nothing really comes to mind... Oh, I know – I'll let her decide.)<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Alright. I want you to ask ME to do something.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Whatever you wish, I shall make it happen.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''She briefly raises an eyebrow in modest surprise, then regains her gentle smile.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:84}：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Interesting... Very well. I know what to ask of you.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''The water beam misses the target. Musashi wins our wager with only a one-point advantage.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Dang. You won.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Her gaze moves from the target onto me, and she gives me a gentle smile.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:84}：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Though that was some outstanding shooting, you ceded the final target to me.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''I'll say, you completely subverted my expectations. Heehee.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Even though you wanted me to win, I still accept my victory.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''So, that leaves us with my request.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I'm all ears.<br>
<br>
Either the merry mood of the amusement park must have gotten to her, or seeing the stuffed animals stirred something inside her...<br>
At any rate, she flashes a distinct smile. A smile like that of an innocent child.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:84}：</span><br>
It's simple. You will accompany me and have a jolly good time in the amusement park.<br>

{{折叠面板|标题=Dressing for the Banquet|选项=17|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ayase：</span><br>
Bunny, don't go. We'll play after I've gotten cha– Whuh?<br>
C-Commander! Wh-what're you doing... Oh! Is it time already?<br>
<br>
On the other side of the door, Ayase is clearly flustered.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Yeah. We're supposed to meet now.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ayase：</span><br>
S-sorry, but you'll have to wait! I-I haven't changed into my banquet dress yet!<br>
Oh gosh... I just remembered I also forgot to lock the door...<br>
The way i-it's going now, I'm guaranteed to be late... *sigh*...<br>
I'm so darn forgetful... a-and I can't get into these clothes...<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：It's not the end of the world.</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：I can help you.</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Take it easy. Go at your own pace.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ayase：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Okay... B-but even if I do, I don't have any idea how to put this on anymore...<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''D-do you think you could help me?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''That is, if you want me to.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ayase：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Yes, please... I don't even know how I'm supposed to put this on anymore...<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''C-come in and help me, please...<br>
<br>
With her permission, I step inside and start examining how this banquet dress is supposed to come together.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ayase：</span><br>
Umm... Is it confusing?<br>
I've tried everything, and I still can't get it on...<br>
<br>
She hides behind a curtain so thin I can still partly see through it. She is red from head to toe from nervousness.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
It's a bit tricky, but I think I can help.<br>
Put this on first, then affix it with a ribbon.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ayase：</span><br>
Okay... Y-you mean, put the ribbon around my chest? Umm... Is this right?<br>
Eek! I-it came loose again!<br>
Th-this is hopeless...<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：(Give her verbal instructions.)</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：(Put the ribbon on by yourself.)</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''You need to make sure it's on tight first before you put on the ribbon.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ayase：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Umm... I-I'll try...<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Mmgh... Mmhh! No, it's no good... Please help me...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''It's okay. Let's see if I can do it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ayase：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Oh no... I'm sorry to have to bother you like this...<br>
<br>
After some difficulties, Ayase has finally overcome the trial known as putting on a dress.<br>
But, when I assume we're ready to leave, she stops in her tracks and stares at the floor, gripping the rim of her dress.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ayase：</span><br>
Do you... Do you think this looks good on me?<br>
It doesn't look... w-weird, does it? I'm just wondering b-because...<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：(Console her.)</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
It doesn't look weird. In fact, it looks great on you.<br>
Don't be so nervous. I promise you'd look cute in anything.<br>
<br>
My encouragement blows away her nervousness, and she gives me a bright smile.<br>
Courageously, she takes my hand and holds it tight, then gathers herself with a deep breath.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ayase：</span><br>
Okay! Let's go then, Commander! I... I can't wait to dance with you!<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">???：</span><br>
I've finally found you, Commander.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Watarase：</span><br>
A set of wheels screeches to a stop, and I hear a female voice from behind me.<br>
Turning around, I see a pumpkin carriage built with transparent materials pulled by a horse, with a smiling Watarase in the cabin.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Watarase? What are you doing here?</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：Great timing. Want to watch the fireworks together?</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Watarase：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Why, to watch the fireworks with you, of course.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Watarase：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''I do. In fact, that's what I came here to do.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Watarase：</span><br>
It's fortunate that I ran into you here. If I hadn't, I would have no one to share such a gorgeous sight with.<br>
Incidentally, are you here for the same reason? To watch the fireworks?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
Nope. I'm honestly just here by chance.<br>
This place is a bit remote, but the view is great.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Watarase：</span><br>
You're quite lucky then, Commander.<br>
Let's get comfortable before we talk more. Would you like to join me in my carriage?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
Well, that's a question of how more than anything else. How do you get in it?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Watarase：</span><br>
If you wish for it, it can be done. That's how dreams work.<br>
Come. There's a thin tatami cushion in here. It's quite comfortable. I have drinks ready as well.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
Alright.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Watarase：</span><br>
I approach the transparent pumpkin carriage. Watarase extends a hand to me.<br>
Take my hand and come inside.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：(Grasp it.)</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Watarase：</span><br>
I climb inside the carriage and she moves aside to make space for me.<br>
Mmh... This is a bit cramped... Please try to bear with it.<br>
I'll be sure to pay closer attention to the size of the cabin's interior next time.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
It's okay. Nothing I can't handle.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Watarase：</span><br>
I sit down on the space she cleared out for me. Only now does it hit me that it's so cramped that we are quite literally rubbing shoulders in here.<br>
Whew... This is a bit embarrassing.<br>
She drinks down the red contents of her glass, then wraps her arm around mine, with some difficulty.<br>
I'm feeling a bit tipsy... Would you mind lending me your shoulder?<br>
Her voice sounds slightly muffled somehow, perhaps because she drank it all in one go.<br>
As the spectacle to go with her wine, fireworks shoot into the sky and explode in dazzling colors. Her smile, too, is of the dazzling variety.<br>
Being all alone with you, watching these beautiful fireworks together... Truly, this is a dream come true.<br>
How wonderful it would be to never... wake up from it...<br>
Her voice shrinks into a whisper. I can hear her breaths slowing down, becoming calmer.<br>
Sweet dreams... Commander... Zzzzz...<br>

<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Whew...<br>
<br>
Having spent the whole day at the amusement park, I fall into bed like a tree toppling over.<br>
While I'm still barely awake, I suddenly sense that something isn't quite right.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">???：</span><br>
Heheh! Good morning, Commander!<br>
<br>
My bed creaks, and suddenly I feel the weight of a woman's body on me.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Bremerton?</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2："Morning"?</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''How'd you get in here?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bremerton：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''You were out and about the whole day, and I figured you could use a massage.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''So I walked in, just like that. You're totally defenseless when you're exhausted!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Uh-huh...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bremerton：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Hey, don't worry 'bout the details. Do you want a massage or not?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''It's too early for "good morning," don't you think? It's still the very EARLY morning.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bremerton：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Early morning is still morning, so good morning it is!<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''You've gotta be exhausted after wanderin' around the amusement park all day. That's why I'mma give you a real good massage!<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：(Accept her offer.)</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：(Decline.)</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Sure. Go ahead.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bremerton：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Ahaha! You're gonna love this!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''I think I'd prefer to just sleep instead.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bremerton：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''You're sleepy, I get it, but you NEED a massage or those muscles're gonna be aching like hell tomorrow.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bremerton：</span><br>
Just close your eyes and relax. I'll handle everything else!<br>
First up, let's get some essential oil on you. Ooh, this smells good! Just gonna warm this up with my hands aaand...<br>
<br>
She spreads the warm oil over my back and shoulders. Its light aroma fills my nostrils.<br>
Then the massage begins. It's neither too rough, nor too gentle – it's just perfect.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bremerton：</span><br>
God, your whole body's stiff as a board. I've gotta soften you up good.<br>
Today must've been a REAL workout for you. Your muscles feel like rubber.<br>
Speakin' of, did you enjoy yourself at the amusement park? Call me curious.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Yeah. I rode all kinds of fun attractions.</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：Sure did. I had a blast.</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bremerton：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Same! Shoutouts to my favorites – the roller coaster and the Ferris wheel. We should totally ride those together sometime!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bremerton：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''I bet! You haven't had a chance to let loose for a long while now!<br>
<br>
Between our chit-chat and the rhythmic massage I'm getting, I can feel the sleepiness creeping up on me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bremerton：</span><br>
Commander? Hellooo? Mind if I press on this spot?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Uh-huh...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bremerton：</span><br>
I'll take your silence as a yes!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Uh-huh...<br>
<br>
Straddling the line between dreams and reality, I hear Bremerton grumble something under her breath.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bremerton：</span><br>
Maaan... Just falling asleep on a girl when she's massaging you like this...<br>
If that's how it's gonna be, fine...<br>
<br>
The bed jiggles faintly, and a moment later, I feel a warm kiss on my cheek.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bremerton：</span><br>
G'night, Commander.<br>
Sleep tight♪<br>
