<br>
The time is late, and there's a rustling sound as someone searches around for something.<br>
I gently open the door and head in the direction of the noise.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Anchorage：</span><br>
Guided by the faint light radiating from the open refrigerator, I find the source – it's Anchorage, rummaging around the fridge's contents.<br>
Sausage? No... Cheese... Not that either... Ugh...<br>
Milk! Strawberry milk! There you are!<br>
{playername}：<br>
Grabbing a late-night snack?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Anchorage：</span><br>
Oh! Teacher! I'm surprised you're here.<br>
Hearing my voice makes her jolt. She looks over to face me.<br>
I... can't sleep.<br>
I want something sour and sweet like strawberry milk. Is that okay?<br>
{playername}：<br>
Sure.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Anchorage：</span><br>
Thank you, Teacher!<br>
Heehee. Strawberry milk... Let's drink it together!<br>
She picks up the pack of strawberry milk and carefully pours its contents into a cup.<br>
I'll be super careful so you can drink it, too...<br>
Good... Almost there... Just a little more... Ah!<br>
In her enthusiasm, she pours too much milk, causing it to spill.<br>
Teacher, this is no good... My milk... I spilled it...<br>
The sensation of the cold liquid trickling down her skin makes her flap about in a panic. She looks up at me for help.<br>
Teacher, my clothes got soaky-soaked...<br>
Hm? Your clothes... got soaked, too.<br>
But the milk... is still nice and sweet. Heehee.<br>
Try it, Teacher.<br>
She licks the corner of her mouth then presents her milk-stained cheek to me.<br>
Do you like... my strawberry taste?<br>
There's also some on here.<br>
And the strawberry smell is on you as well...<br>
*gulp gulp*<br>
So yummy. I'm satisfied.<br>
Sleepy now... Teacher, let's go to bed together!<br>
But my clothes are still milky... Don't wanna sleep in milky clothes.<br>
I wanna shower. Can you help me, Teacher?<br>
Let's go. We'll shower together.<br>

<br>
Enterprise sent me a message that convinced me that I just had to check on her, so I went.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
So, as rain falls around me, I arrive at an open-air bath in the woods. She's soaking in a tub and quickly notices me.<br>
...Commander? Why are you here? Came to get some fresh air?<br>
{playername}：<br>
You sent me a message. "You really can't soak for too long in a hot spring."<br>
You didn't reply after that, so I wanted to make sure you were fine.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
On her cheeks, there are still the traces of a warm blush.<br>
She becomes aware of my gaze and leans against the tub's edge, relaxing her shoulders while narrowing her eyes.<br>
Thanks for the concern. The water was just so nice that I didn't wanna get out.<br>
I'm fine now. I cooled down with some shower water.<br>
She holds her long, wet hair up with her hand. The strands glisten around her fingers like coils of silver.<br>
In her eyes, a vacant look. They're like two lakes resting in the morning mist.<br>
Ah, sorry... I'm bluffing here. Truth be told, I still feel a bit light-headed.<br>
Could you do me a favor and help cool me off a bit?<br>
She lightly nods her head at the showerhead lying to my side. I pick it up.<br>
Hey, wai–<br>
Before she can finish, a stream of water comes rushing out of the showerhead and splatters onto me.<br>
{playername}：<br>
Uh... What were you going to say?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
Pfft. I was going to say the water pressure's pretty high on that one.<br>
If only I'd been quicker on the draw. Heh.<br>
I turn the showerhead off, then Enterprise picks up a towel lying on the tub's rim and wipes my face with it.<br>
She devotes her full concentration to it, and her movements are thorough and gentle.<br>
Then, seeing how soaked my clothes are, she slightly furrows her brow and breathes a small sigh.<br>
You'll get sick if you walk around in wet clothes.<br>
Why don't you hop into the tub with me? You can warm up, then put on new clothes.<br>
That should keep you safe from catching a cold.<br>
As she says that, she shifts her gaze to a point outside the floor-to-ceiling window, as though she's noticed something.<br>
Turning around, I see that beyond the still-falling rain in the sky, a faint rainbow has formed.<br>
A rainbow before the rain's stopped. You don't see that every day.<br>
Sometimes, I think, "There's nothing that'd make me happier than getting to quietly admire the scenery with you." Like this.<br>
I feel like tranquil moments like this are what I've been fighting for all this time.<br>
Sitting reclined against the tub's edge, she softly leans close to me. Even through my clothes, I can clearly feel the mild warmth from her body.<br>
Look, Commander. The rain's going to stop before long.<br>
I've heard through the grapevine that the forest smells nice and refreshing right after rainfall.<br>
Once we leave the hot spring... how about we go for a walk together?<br>

{{折叠面板|标题=Steamy Therapy|选项=3|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<br>
Having finished my work for the day, I went for a walk through the hills. Besides the scent of pine leaves around me, there's a humid smell mixed in there somewhere, and the sound of running water in the distance.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bois Belleau：</span><br>
I follow the sound and cut through the mist, and eventually, I catch sight of a hazy silhouette across a curtain of steam.<br>
Hm? Commander?<br>
Did you come here on a break from your work as well? I suppose everyone needs a change of pace.<br>
Bois Belleau is soaking up to her waist in the water. The rising steam gently caresses her shoulders.<br>
{playername}：<br>
Not exactly. I just followed the sound.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bois Belleau：</span><br>
So we just happened to meet. Well, good timing nonetheless. I was actually going to recommend this hot spring therapy to you when I got back.<br>
The research claims it's a rather unique form of therapy that's able to wash away the toil of laboring.<br>
And, seeing as you work on a harsh schedule and scarcely get the time to relax properly...<br>
I was thinking we could do this therapy together.<br>
Saying that, she extends a hand to me, prompting me to come into the water.<br>
I find no leeway to say no when faced with her eyes, filled with kindness and care.<br>
{playername}：<br>
Alright. I'll come in.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bois Belleau：</span><br>
Mind your step. Take hold of my hand and slowly come in. Get yourself accustomed to the water's temperature.<br>
Come on, come here and sit next to me. That way I can swiftly deal with issues, should any arise.<br>
She scoops up a handful of the warm water and gently pours it on my shoulder.<br>
This ought to take care of both the filth and fatigue you've worked up over the day.<br>
See? The water isn't at all too hot, is it?<br>
Now, I want you to relax... Look at that – your skin is turning slightly red.<br>
Improving your blood circulation also slowly improves your mood. You'll see.<br>
The water slightly whirls each time she adjusts her position, the resulting little ripples carrying a stimulating warmth with them.<br>
After pouring on some more hot water, she sits down next to me again. Her soft exhales graze my ear.<br>
So? Do you feel the hot spring's effects?<br>
{playername}：<br>
It does feel like my body's gotten a lot lighter.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bois Belleau：</span><br>
That's good. Then let's move on to the next step.<br>
I want you to stay and soak for a while longer. About an hour in total.<br>
But first... let me quickly examine your body.<br>
She reaches forward and softly grips my wrist. A faint aroma emanates from her wet hair.<br>
Your pulse is going up. Don't worry, though – that's nothing unusual.<br>
Just take deep breaths in and out and match my rhythm.<br>
Breathe in... Breathe out. Breathe in... Breathe out.<br>
Breathe in... Breathe out...<br>
Breathe... Zzz...<br>
Her voice gets smaller and smaller until her breathing turns into quiet snoring.<br>
Her body leans against mine. A humid warmth transmits from her to me.<br>
{playername}：<br>
Um, Belleau?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bois Belleau：</span><br>
I gently nudge and try to wake her, but the only response is a calm breath and the beating of her heart. She is sleeping like a log.<br>
Commander... Mmh... Ahh...<br>
Thank you... for staying with me...<br>
Her relaxed body rests on my shoulder, and a whisper and a faint aroma brush against my ear.<br>
As the hills around us fade into and out of existence in the mist, the only thing I can make out clearly is her face, right next to mine.<br>
I get comfortable and enjoy this relaxing moment between us while keeping an eye on her.<br>

<br>
Taking advantage of some free time between work, I make my way to the hot springs, hoping to rest my weary bones.<br>
When I arrive, though, something feels wrong. This place is normally bustling, and yet, today there's an eerie silence.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Duguay-Trouin：</span><br>
Well, well, Commander. I'm in the midst of a purification ritual, and here you come along.<br>
Did you come to confess your sins to a naked nun, perhaps?<br>
Duguay-Trouin appears, donning black silk oozing with steam.<br>
{playername}：<br>
I just wanted to soak and recharge my batteries... Didn't expect someone else to be here.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Duguay-Trouin：</span><br>
Heheh. I got here a little sooner by chance, that's all.<br>
That said, timing can make all the difference in the world. Just like now.<br>
Perhaps you really did come for a soak, or perhaps you came to behold the ritual...<br>
Whatever your wish may be, I will grant it♪<br>
As you can see, I just finished my purification. All the filth in these waters has been purged.<br>
But, just between you and me, there is still another demon lurking in this hot spring resort.<br>
Its evil presence has already tarnished many other baths, and...<br>
She stops herself mid-sentence and carefully examines me from top to bottom.<br>
Oh my word! You've accumulated quite a lot of impurities before coming here, Commander!<br>
I'll need to give you a thorough cleansing to remove the evil that's possessed you!<br>
{playername}：<br>
A "cleansing"? What do I need to do?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Duguay-Trouin：</span><br>
Oh, it's quite simple, trust me.<br>
If you'll cast your mind back to just a moment ago, I said I've purified this bath.<br>
In other words, all I ask of you is to get into the water with me.<br>
Then we may begin the purification ritual.<br>
With those words, she temptingly retreats to the edge of the hot spring and poses with a come-hither gesture.<br>
She smiles as she sticks her tongue out teasingly in anticipation of what's to come next.<br>
Well, Commander?<br>
I'm extending an invitation to you. Surely you won't give me the cold shoulder?<br>
{playername}：<br>
Ahh... I get what you mean by "purification" now.<br>
It's just an excuse to lure me into your trap, isn't it?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Duguay-Trouin：</span><br>
Ahaha! Oh, you joker, you.<br>
I simply needed an excuse to have this resort all to myself to excise all the demons here. You must understand.<br>
But that's just a minor detail at the end of the day. What matters is that this place is just the start of something greater.<br>
We have all the time in the world, Commander. Come on – join me in the waters so we can purify every inch of this hot spring.<br>

<br>
Hearing a strange rustling sound coming from the bathroom, I feel inquisitive and walk up to the door.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
Then, I open it and find...<br>
C-Commander?!<br>
The, um... bath isn't ready just yet...<br>
Could you wait just a little longer, please?<br>
I only have a towel on...<br>
{playername}：<br>
Helena? What are you doing here?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
Um... St. Louis said I should– No, that's besides the point.<br>
The shower in my place broke, and, well... I had no choice but to come to yours and borrow it.<br>
Perhaps it's due to the hot vapor in the bathroom – whatever the case, her cheeks are slightly flushed.<br>
{playername}：<br>
I see...<br>
That aside, what was that sound I heard just earlier? You okay in there?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
I-I'm fine!<br>
{playername}：<br>
Alright, then. Take care not to slip.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
W-wait!<br>
You see, um... I ran a Sakuran hinoki bath since I thought you might like that, and...<br>
It's my first time doing anything like this... and I might have messed a few things up.<br>
Like forgetting where I put the hinoki ball... or adding too many citruses to the bath.<br>
Or how just a moment ago, I... I dropped the soap.<br>
You don't... happen to see where it fell, do you?<br>
Seeing her so flustered, I hold my tongue for a moment and point to her feet.<br>
Her eyes widen in surprise as she realizes the thing she's been looking so hard for is right under her nose.<br>
Oh, gosh... It was right at my feet this whole time. How did I not notice?<br>
Dejected, she crouches down to pick up the soap on the ground.<br>
However, the moment she stands up again, she staggers and bumps into the glass door before she's able to stabilize herself.<br>
{playername}：<br>
You alright? You sure you don't want me to come in and help?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
I'm... I'm okay! I just lost my focus for a second and didn't watch my step!<br>
Just give me another minute or two, okay? The bath is almost ready!<br>
Yes, just a minute...<br>
I'll be done before you know it!<br>

{{折叠面板|标题=Sweetly Intoxicating Spring|选项=6|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Masséna：</span><br>
Masséna's strategy of using puppy eyes had won me over, and she dragged me along to a place called the Sweetly Intoxicating Spring.<br>
Look, Commander – this water is clear like jelly.<br>
It looks... delicious.<br>
{playername}：<br>
Drinking bath water doesn't sound like the best idea.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Masséna：</span><br>
Just a little should be fine, heehee. You shouldn't do it, though.<br>
Crystal-clear hot water pours forth from the tap, slowly filling up the tub.<br>
Unable to bear the wait any longer, she plops down into the bath and turns over.<br>
*lick*...<br>
Mmm! I knew it'd taste sweet.<br>
That said, it could use a bit more sugar...<br>
{playername}：<br>
Want me to fetch you some fruit?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Masséna：</span><br>
Sure! Preferably some sweet cherries.<br>
I appreciate it!<br>
I return with a plate of cherries and find her resting on the edge of the bath, staring intently at me.<br>
The moment our gazes meet, she looks at me with eyes teeming with anticipation and waves at me.<br>
Welcome back, Commander. Welcome back, cherries. Or should I say, welcome back to my mouth!<br>
Aahh...<br>
She opens her mouth for me and blinks at me, seemingly asking me to feed her.<br>
Not one to let her down, I take a cherry and put it in her mouth.<br>
Delicious! But also sour. It needs to be sweeter.<br>
{playername}：<br>
Good thing I brought some fruit juice as well.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Masséna：</span><br>
Juice! You really know just what I need.<br>
Delighted, she picks up the cup of juice but stops just before putting it to her lips. She freezes in place and starts thinking about something.<br>
{playername}：<br>
Something the matter?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Masséna：</span><br>
I just got an idea, Commander. An idea for how to make this even sweeter for both of us.<br>
It's something I can only do when you're here. Heheh... This.<br>
She catches me off guard, hugging and pulling me into the water with her.<br>
There we go! You are pretty sweet just like that...<br>
But now you are even sweeter!<br>
I guess this is the part where we... drink from the chalice? Or cup, in this case. Heehee.<br>
Saying that, she hands the cup to me and smoothly hooks her arm around mine.<br>
Both holding on to the cup with one hand, we exchange sips from it. A trickle of cold juice runs down her lip.<br>
*gulp*... *gulp*...<br>
Ahh... So delicious. The sweetness is making me all dizzy...<br>
Heehee... Can you feel it, Commander? The sweet mood spreading around us like a cloud?<br>
How about next... we do something even sweeter?<br>

{{折叠面板|标题=A Dip in the Moonlight|选项=7|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<br>
White steam rises from the hot spring lined with black stone. A few pale cherry blossom tree petals rest on the water's surface.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Noshiro：</span><br>
Noshiro moves back out of the water and reclines against a nearby rock surface, then turns and waves her hand at me.<br>
I'm over here, Commander.<br>
The wet towel clings tightly to her skin, accentuating the delicate lines of her waist.<br>
The water here is just the right temperature. Have a dip. I already checked that it's good.<br>
Also, can you believe how good this view is? You can see the stars in the night sky so clearly.<br>
Whew... This is what a hot spring should be – soothing for the body and spirit.<br>
There's a vaguely drowsy look in her eyes, contrasted by her smile, which seems even sweeter than ordinarily.<br>
She moves her well-proportioned legs through the water, drawing little ripples on its tranquil surface.<br>
Eventually, her eyes open like she's remembered something. She reaches for a bottle of milk beside her and offers it to me with a smile.<br>
People like to drink milk after a soak, but there's a certain elegance in drinking it while still in the bath.<br>
Just... be careful not to spill it, okay?<br>
Drink it slowly. Savor it one sip at a time.<br>
When I move forward to take the milk from her, the towel wrapped around my waist loosens and slips into the water.<br>
{playername}：<br>
Uh...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Noshiro：</span><br>
I reach down to pick it up, but my hand is stopped by her slender, fair leg.<br>
I mean, isn't one supposed to meet the hot spring's water naked?<br>
And to be blunt, I'd like to see your "birthday suit," too...<br>
If that feels one-sided to you... I'm willing to be as bare as you.<br>
In a blink, Noshiro is suddenly right next to me.<br>
From her soft voice exudes a youthful, sweet scent, caressing my cheek with the rising vapor.<br>
What I'm trying to say is... follow your heart, Commander.<br>
Will you take your towel back, or will I–<br>
Her body sways to the side before she can finish speaking.<br>
I'm starting to feel a little light-headed... I may have soaked for too long.<br>
Thank god you were right here. If you hadn't been, I might have fallen and caused a real splash.<br>
Without the distance and steam obscuring my view, I now realize that the blush on her face has spread to cover even the space behind her ears.<br>
At the perfect opportunity, her towel, too, slides down into the still water.<br>
Before I can do anything, she softly hooks her arm behind my neck.<br>
Mmh... It's strange how I feel so floaty...<br>
I guess sharing a bath is one of the few cases where it's not so embarrassing to lay out the naked truth, so to speak...<br>
So, whatever we're going to do next...<br>
It's all up to you, my beloved Commander. Heehee.<br>
