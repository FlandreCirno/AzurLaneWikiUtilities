Going Outside Sucks<br>
Port - Outside the Office<br>
*sip* *siiiiiiiiip*<br>
I hear the sound of someone sipping loudly through a straw coming from the other end of the hallway. I follow the noise to find Whydah, splayed out on the floor.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Whydah, what are you doing here?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Whydah：</span><br>
*yaaawn*... Oh, Commander.<br>
My room has this regularly-scheduled cleaning functionality, and that's what's going on right now... So in other words, I've been exiled.<br>
Banished from paradise, sacrificed on the altar of convenience... *sigh*, what a pain. I just wanna go back and play games...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
...Have you ever considered turning it off?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Whydah：</span><br>
I'd have to redo all the settings again. And that'd be a pain.<br>
More importantly, were you going somewhere?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Yeah. I somehow don't have any work lined up at the moment, so I figured why not take a stroll?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Whydah：</span><br>
*yaaawn*... Is that so? Well, have a good time~<br>
Oh, right. Can you bring me some crisps? Gotta have some snacks while basking in the sun, right?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Huh. She does like relaxing beneath the warm sunlight, doesn't she?)<br>
(Maybe I should take her somewhere instead of leaving her stranded out here in the hallway...)<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Wanna go on a date?</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：If you want to bask in the sun, the hallway's not the best place for that.</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Whydah：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''A d-date? Do you really enjoy such... physically and emotionally draining ordeals?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Whydah：</span><br>
Ehh... I'm not opposed to that, but going outside is a pain.<br>
But maybe... with you, it might not be so bad...<br>
Then again, I don't wanna get up.<br>
But at the same time, I don't wanna miss out on this opportunity either since you're always busy... Maybe if you could arrange a ride for us.<br>
Bleh, I'm already getting exhausted just thinking about it...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
So, wanna go or not?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Whydah：</span><br>
Errrhhhhmmm... Fine, I'll go!<br>

<br>
Set Sail - Treasure Voyage!<br>
<br>
The Ghost Ship and the Sleeping Treasure<br>
I chatted casually with Whydah as we walked, and we soon found ourselves in the bustling shopping district.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Whydah：</span><br>
Oh... Commander, look over there~<br>
<br>
I look in the direction that she is pointing, and see a big sign labeled, "Hyper-Realistic Escape Room".<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
...Who let the green cat cook again this time?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Whydah：</span><br>
Akashi is a very hard worker, you know. The amount of work she puts into the promo materials is so impressive it's almost sickening.<br>
Let's take a look-see... The current theme is... Ah, yes. "The Ghost Ship and the Sleeping Treasure".<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Sounds like something you'd be good at. Wanna give it a shot?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Whydah：</span><br>
Ehhh... I much prefer lounging around doing nothing to being a swashbuckling pirate, though.<br>
A soft, warm bed, an unlimited supply of games to play... Truly, the best kind of life, without ever having to worry about storms.<br>
But having that said... I might be a little interested in that completion bonus...<br>
"Super-Mega-Exclusive Potato Crisps Set," "Pirates' Kitchen: Don't Fall in Love Together, Collector's Edition"...<br>
And this "Instant-Sleep Human-and-Shipgirl-Tested Ergonomic Pillow"...<br>
All of these are mega-limited items that are no longer in circulation.<br>
But, why can I only choose one thing? Surely some of these aren't even worth anything!<br>
I can't deciiiiide!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
You really shouldn't count your chickens before they hatch.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Whydah：</span><br>
Hmm? Does that mean you're also up for the challenge?<br>
I'm sure it'll pose no difficulty to the mighty Whydah, but still, what a pain.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Don't you want that Super-Mega-Exclusive Potato Crisps set?</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：You've got your eyes on that Pirate's Kitchen collector's edition, right?</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项3：Wouldn't it be nice to get your hands on that instant-sleep pillow?</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Whydah：</span><br>
Ermm... Well, I suppose it would be hard to procure it through other means.<br>
In that sense, playing this escape room game would be the path of least resistance.<br>
<br>
She lifts her head, looks around, then steps closer to me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Whydah：</span><br>
Here's my condition. If I get too tired to finish the escape room, it's up to you to carry me across the finish line.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Sure, you can count on me.<br>
<br>
And so, I purchase two tickets for the escape room, grab our starting supplies, and then head inside with Whydah in tow.<br>

Set Sail - Treasure Voyage!<br>
<br>
Treasure Hunting Sucks<br>
After passing through a long, dark corridor, we finally arrive at the escape room's titular ghost ship.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Whydah：</span><br>
Heh, not bad. This pirate ship looks pretty authentic, and is well-made, too.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
That's Akashi for you. She doesn't cut any corners when it comes to making money.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Whydah：</span><br>
That cat really does like making money as much as everyone claims, huh?<br>
But, y'know... Heehee, this place is kinda bringing back old memories.<br>
Commander, let's go have a look arou–<br>
<br>
*creaaaaak*<br>
Whydah steps onto the old boards of the ghost ship with unexpected enthusiasm. Just then...<br>
*CRAAAAASH!*<br>
Suddenly, the writhing tentacles of a giant sea monster completely surround the pirate ship.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Whydah：</span><br>
Woah, I didn't expect this scenario to involve combat!<br>
I guess I was a fool expecting those rare rewards to come easily.<br>
Alright, swing that sword! We're having calamari for dinner tonight!<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Aye-aye!</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：Uhh, you'll be helping, right?</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Whydah：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Ummm... Ahem, of course! I'll cover your back!<br>
<br>
Through Whydah's impeccable "support," and her expert use of the tactic, "be as unmoving as the mountain," the battle came to an end smoothly.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Whydah：</span><br>
Nice going, Commander.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：You, too.</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：That's what you'd call a literal 1v9...</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Whydah：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Oh. Heehee... Well, it's not like I did much...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Whydah：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Y-yeah, you're just that amazing.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Well, uhh...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Whydah：</span><br>
I mean... A win's a win, right? You didn't even need my help.<br>
Besides, just because I'm a pirate doesn't mean that fighting's my default modus operandi. It's a pain in the butt... and there are easier ways to get treasure.<br>
*yaaawn*... Anyway, enough about me. Take a look over here. And here, and there, too.<br>
Now that you've defeated the tentacles, new mechanisms have appeared.<br>
Generally speaking, when it comes to these escape rooms, you can exit if you manage to activate all the mechanisms.<br>
I'll take this one over here. I'll be counting on you to do the rest, okay?<br>
<br>
Whydah and I make short work of three of the mechanisms, and we arrive at the final one together.<br>
The device is suspended high up in the air, beyond what I can reach even if I jumped. And, there doesn't appear to be any way to climb up either.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Whydah：</span><br>
What's the plan now?<br>
We can always give up if it's too much of a hassle...<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Let's try coming up with something else.</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：How about I give you a boost?</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Hrmm...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Whydah：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''That look on your face... You really don't like being defeated, huh?<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Let's see... Uhh, how about you try boosting me up? Maybe that might be enough to do the trick?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''She averts her eyes slightly. Even as her oversized pirate hat covers much of her face, it cannot entirely cover the blush that has bloomed all over her cheeks.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''It's worth a shot.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''(That's right, one of the stipulations of the escape room is that TWO people must participate.)<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''(Which means that we might literally have to use each other to find a way out.)<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''If I lift you up, you should be able to reach it, right?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Whydah：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''I, uhh... I suppose I don't mind...<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''She averts her eyes slightly. Even as her oversized pirate hat covers much of her face, it cannot entirely cover the blush that has bloomed all over her cheeks.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Whydah：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''But, be careful, okay?<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''I can take a tumble and be perfectly fine, but try not to hurt yourself.<br>
<br>
I approach her from behind and place my hands on her hips.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Whydah：</span><br>
Ooh...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Sorry, did that hurt?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Whydah：</span><br>
Nuooooo... H-hurry it up! I wanna get back to my room and laze around...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Alright, I hear you.<br>
<br>
I lift her high up into the air, toward the device hanging from the ceiling.<br>
Although, it seems that she isn't used to being picked up by others. She grips my shoulders tightly and starts instinctively squirming and thrashing around.<br>
The hems and sleeves of her loose, airy dress sway with her movements, and every time her clothes brush against my face, her faint yet pleasant scent wafts into my nostrils.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Whydah：</span><br>
Uhh... I think I've got it.<br>
<br>
She reaches for the final mechanism and presses it down. With a loud groan, the hold door that was shut tightly before slowly opens.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Fantastic. Now, we can continue forward.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Whydah：</span><br>
Ahem...<br>
Mind setting me down first?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Mhm. Thanks for your hard work.</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：It'll be more efficient to continue like this!!</span>'''''<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''I lower her until she can plant her feet on solid ground.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Whydah：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''It wasn't particularly hard work or anything...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Whydah：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''N-nonsense... It's more efficient if we each move on our own... P-put me down already...<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''My teasing seems to make her even more flustered.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''As you will.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''I lower her until she can plant her feet on solid ground.<br>
<br>
The petite girl lightly taps her toes against the ground, fixing the oversized shoes that had almost fallen off.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Whydah：</span><br>
Commander, your hand, please.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Hmm? What's the matter?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Whydah：</span><br>
We'll need to... further increase our efficiency for the challenges up ahead.<br>
This old-fashioned trap can't hold us back.<br>
You just watch from the sideline. I can take care of the rest.<br>
<br>
She takes me by the hand and pulls me toward the back of the room.<br>

Set Sail - Treasure Voyage!<br>
<br>
Storm of Terror!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Whydah：</span><br>
Oh. This should be it. Go ahead and insert that item from earlier in here... Yup, I think I heard some mechanism moving.<br>
This is all way too easy compared to the real deal in video games.<br>
Come over next time and I'll show you what a real challenge looks like.<br>
<br>
*rumble rumble*<br>
The door in the back of the room slides open, but what awaits us is not a welcoming exit, but rather a deck amidst a terrible storm.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Whydah：</span><br>
But, didn't we do everything that we needed to do? I'm sure I didn't make any mistakes. Maybe there's some hidden component?<br>
<br>
As soon as we step out onto the deck, the deafening roar of thunder echoes around us, and we find ourselves engulfed in heavy rain.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Whydah：</span><br>
Urgh... What an awful storm. I don't like this...<br>
Akashi, you really don't have to be such a tryhard...<br>
<br>
(I've never seen her so distressed before... She must really have a bad time with storms.)<br>
I look around the deck in a hurry, finding a small section of overhanging planks that provides some shelter from the rain.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Whydah, head over there and wait for me.<br>
I'll figure out what we have to do here.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Whydah：</span><br>
Got it... Be careful out there.<br>
<br>
I search all over the deck area, but fail to find anything vaguely resembling a clue.<br>
As time passes, the storm around us grows stronger and stronger, causing the pirate ship to rock violently like a leaf caught in a raging flood.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Whydah：</span><br>
I never knew an escape room could be so dangerous... I just wanna go home and eat potato crisps and play games...<br>
<br>
Her voice is becoming fainter and shallower.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
There's nothing to be scared of. All of this is just an elaborate set-up. It's not real.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Whydah：</span><br>
Yeah... I know, but still...<br>
I don't like this at all. I don't want to be in danger...<br>
<br>
Despite saying she knows better, she shrinks even further into her oversized coat.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：(Try to comfort her with a hug.)</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：(Call it quits.)</span>'''''<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''When I sidle up to her to fold her delicate body into a hug, she suddenly startles as if some life is coming back into her.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Don't be scared. I'm right here with you.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''After staying still for a few moments, she regains her composure. Slowly but surely, she tugs gently at the back of my shirt and returns the hug.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Whydah：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''You're so warm, Commander... I'm so glad you're here...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''(We originally came out here to have a good time, but she is getting more and more miserable with each minute we spend in this storm.)<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Let's just give up and get out of here.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''However, as soon as she hears the words, "give up." she lifts her head and stares at me for a while.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Then, she rises to her feet, turns toward me, and buries her face in my chest.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Whydah：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''We've already made it through so many annoying and tiresome things... so it'd be a pity to give up now.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''I think I'll be fine now. As long as I'm in your arms...<br>
<br>
Her body, which had been frozen in fear previously, starts to loosen up and relax.<br>
She gets up on tiptoes and tries to nuzzle up against me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Whydah：</span><br>
Thank you.<br>
<br>
The two of us stay like that, doing nothing except holding each other as closely as we can, all the way until the storm finally dies down.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Whydah：</span><br>
Huh? The storm... just stopped?<br>
<br>
The sun is shining brightly, without a single cloud in the sky. The waves are calm, as if the storm from earlier was nothing but a bad dream.<br>
And just as suddenly, another door appears on the deck.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Whydah：</span><br>
...Is it finally over?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Yeah, I think so.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Whydah：</span><br>
Urgh... That storm was pretty scary, but...<br>
Y'know, a game you can beat by staying completely AFK...<br>
That might have some potential...<br>
Now then, shall we continue forward?<br>

Set Sail - Treasure Voyage!<br>
<br>
The Goal is in Sight<br>
As we step through the door, we are greeted by a veritable sea of treasure, as far as the eyes can see.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Whydah：</span><br>
Wooooah... Anything is possible here, huh...<br>
Huh, this vase... Wait, no. The real thing's sitting in my treasure trove. This is just a replica.<br>
Holy moly, I've always wanted to get my hands on this out-of-circulation game.<br>
And this flavour of potato crisps... It's basically an urban legend!<br>
<br>
As I watch her roam the mountain of treasures, I suddenly notice some writing on the wall.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Come take a look at this.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Whydah：</span><br>
Ehh... What a pain. Mind reading it for me?<br>
"Escape from the ghost ship with the greatest treasure in hand, and you shall be granted the greatest victory."<br>
"The greatest treasure?" What the heck is that?<br>
Hmm... Any guesses?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(This isn't my area of expertise. If anyone's knowledgeable about this stuff, it's got to be her.)<br>
Sorry, I'm drawing blanks here. I think this one's up to you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Whydah：</span><br>
How am I supposed to pick just one thing?<br>
Maybe I'll go with the out-of-circulation game after all...<br>
<br>
Even as she grumbles, she starts sifting through the mountain of treasure.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Whydah：</span><br>
Can you really call a game the "greatest"? In terms of monetary value, definitely not...<br>
What about "the greatest," in a literary sense? The most precious? The most influential?<br>
<br>
She stops and turns to look at me.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
What's the matter?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Whydah：</span><br>
It's nothing... I think I've made up my mind, though.<br>
<br>
She sets down the discontinued game and comes over to take my hand.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Hmm? Not going to choose anything?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Whydah：</span><br>
I've already made my choice.<br>
Let's go.<br>
<br>
Hand-in-hand, the two of us leave the treasure vault through a different door.<br>

Set Sail - Treasure Voyage!<br>
<br>
The Greatest Treasure<br>
The golden glimmer of the treasure vault turns into a mere speck behind us as we head down a long, narrow corridor, until we finally arrive at a modern-looking room.<br>
At the center of the room is a small display stand cordoned off by blue rope, a nearby sign reading, "Treasure Display Area".<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Speaker：</span><br>
Please place your greatest treasure in the designated area.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Whydah：</span><br>
Hmm... Looks like I'm supposed to put the treasure on this stand...<br>
Well then, Commander, mind standing in the treasure display area for me?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(I see, it all makes sense now. Her greatest treasure...)<br>
<br>
Now that I understand what she was trying to say, I quickly walk over and take my place on the stand.<br>
...But, nothing happens.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Speaker：</span><br>
Please place your greatest treasure in the designated area.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Whydah：</span><br>
But I've already shown you my treasure...<br>
The Commander is worth more to me than any bauble.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Speaker：</span><br>
Please place your greatest treasure in the designated area.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Whydah：</span><br>
What a stupidly designed system, Akashi... The Commander is the greatest treasure to us all. How do you not understand this?<br>
<br>
She lets out a soft sigh, then turns toward me with a slight blush on her face.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Whydah：</span><br>
It's all thanks to you that I was able to come to this port, living a life of peace and comfort, with no storms to worry about...<br>
I'm so glad I was able to meet you, Commander. Thank you for letting me be at your side.<br>
All of this is why... you're my greatest treasure.<br>
See? Do you get it now?<br>
If you don't accept the Commander as my answer, I'm gonna complain and raise a stink. I'll even demand a refund and review-bomb you.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：(Pat her on the head.)</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I'm glad I got to meet you, too.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Whydah：</span><br>
Ugh... Commander, I won't grow taller if you keep doing that.<br>
*sigh*... Well, filing a complaint is too much of a hassle. Let's just get going.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Speaker：</span><br>
...Nya?!<br>
Ahem... The clear conditions are being re-evaluated.<br>
Congratulations, nya! The Commander is indeed the greatest treasure, nya! And that means, you've cleared the game, nya!<br>
<br>
*pop pop pop*!<br>
As soon as the announcement that the game has been cleared is made, crackers start to go off all around us, shooting confetti into the air.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Whydah：</span><br>
Heh-heh. Looks like victory is ours.<br>
Another win for us!<br>

Set Sail - Treasure Voyage!<br>
<br>
The End, or the Beginning<br>
Shortly afterward, at the reward exchange booth...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Speaker：</span><br>
Brave pirates, please choose your reward!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Whydah：</span><br>
Ahhhh... Finally, the time has come!<br>
<br>
She bounces toward the prize area with an uncharacteristic spring in her step.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Whydah：</span><br>
Super-Mega-Exclusive Potato Crisps Set, Pirates' Kitchen: Don't Fall in Love Together, Collector's Edition, Instant-Sleep Human-and-Shipgirl-Tested Ergonomic Pillow, and also...<br>
Urgh... I want everything. It's way too hard to choose.<br>
Hmm, actually... Commander, you really did all the heavy lifting back there. It's only fair that you decide.<br>
<br>
She leans into me lazily.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Fair enough.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：The Super-Mega-Exclusive Potato Crisps Set?</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：What about the Pirates' Kitchen collector's edition?</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项3：What about the instant-sleep ergonomic pillow?</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Whydah：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Hmm... Sounds good. There are some delicious flavours that even money can't buy, after all.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''She weighs the luxurious-looking snack pack in her hands, but she still seems reluctant to part with the other treasure.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Whydah：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Hmm... Sounds good. It's a highly-rated two-player co-op game, and the collector's edition is said to come with a legendary recipe that nobody can say no to...<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''She quietly picks up the collector's edition vintage video game, but she still seems reluctant to part with the other treasure.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Whydah：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项3）</span>'''''Hmm... Sounds good. If it works for me, I'll let you use it, too.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项3）</span>'''''She gently picks up the comfortable-looking pillow, but she still seems reluctant to part with the other treasure.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Fair enough.<br>
Everything here looks quite valuable, so it's hard to choose just one thing...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Whydah：</span><br>
Right? It's what I said before. Deciding is such a hassle.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Though, that just goes to show that Akashi knows how to attract people with prizes they would want.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Whydah：</span><br>
That much I can agree with. She does have pretty good taste.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
The overall flow of the escape room was well thought-out too.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Whydah：</span><br>
Huh? Oh...<br>
Yeah, I guess so. There were battles and puzzles... and even hours spent shivering in a fierce storm...<br>
I suppose that averages out to an eleven out of ten~<br>
But, you know, if I want the other two prizes, I'll have to complete the challenge two more times.<br>
Think I can trouble you to endure the storm a few more times?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Speaker：</span><br>
...Nya?!<br>
A-ahem! A heartfelt congratulations to our two brave pirates here!<br>
For your outstanding performance, we are proud to bestow upon you this platinum trophy!<br>
S-so, in other words, all three of today's prizes are yours for the taking, nya!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Whydah：</span><br>
...Wait, seriously? I had the wrong impression of you after all, Akashi~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Speaker：</span><br>
Wh-why of course, nya...<br>
Nyahaha... haha... ha...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Whydah：</span><br>
Aaaaahhhh... Finally, as soon as I get back, I can kick it and sink into this pillow while enjoying these new potato crisps and playing this new game...<br>
What a day it has been... Thanks for everything.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
You really should be thanking Akashi's generosity, if anything.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Whydah：</span><br>
Phew...<br>
<br>
As the sun starts to dip beneath the horizon, lights come to life all around us.<br>
She leans into me with a satisfied smile on her face and a lustrous twinkle in her eyes.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Whydah：</span><br>
Having all that said though, what a pain all of that was~<br>
Well, I guess it's not all bad, going out to have fun with you outside every now and then...<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Same here. I had a great time with you.</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：Yeah, totally. Today was a ton of fun.</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Whydah：</span><br>
Heehee. Anyway, I think you're pretty awesome, so I hope we can continue to have fun together forever~<br>
By the way, I heard that the escape room game's going to change to a new theme in ten days.<br>
Wanna give it another go after that?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Well, well. I never thought you'd be the one asking me out on a date.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Whydah：</span><br>
Why not? You're pretty fun to be around, you know?<br>
Besides, I like sitting in the corner and letting you clear the entire stage for me~<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I think that's gonna get patched out.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Whydah：</span><br>
Boooo. Heehee...<br>
Well, I guess we can make up our minds after we take a look at the prizes.<br>
As for right now...<br>
<br>
She takes my hand and gives it a good squeeze.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Whydah：</span><br>
Let's go and play Pirates' Kitchen together!<br>
