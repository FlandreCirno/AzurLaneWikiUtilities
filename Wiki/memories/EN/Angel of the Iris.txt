Angel of the Iris<br>
<br>
1 The Angel of War and the Judge<br>
Not long ago, before the existence of the Crimson Axis and the Vichya Dominion,<br>
those who bowed in prayer before the Iris' radiance marched under the same banner.<br>
On land and at sea, they coexisted peacefully, united by their faith.<br>
This is a small story from that time.<br>
Somewhere in the Iris Orthodoxy...<br>
A church bell clanged, and little birds resting atop the building's roof took to the skies.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Joffre：</span><br>
Oh, how the time flies.<br>
I suppose I should start on my work.<br>
<br>
Joffre offered a prayer before turning to leave the cathedral. A familiar figure approached her, heading in the opposite direction.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">La Galissonnière：</span><br>
Look at you, prayin' at this time of the day. You're devout, I'll give you that much!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Joffre：</span><br>
I had some time to kill, that's all. More importantly... What brings you here, La Galissonnière? Surely you didn't come here to pray––<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">La Galissonnière：</span><br>
Hahaha! Nah, I was just gonna take the secret passage beneath the cathedral.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Joffre：</span><br>
Are you sure you should be saying things like that so cavalierly? <br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">La Galissonnière：</span><br>
It'll be fiiine. You and I are the only ones here at this hour.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Terrible：</span><br>
I wouldn't be so sure about that.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Joffre：</span><br>
Overconfidence is a sin, La Galissonnière.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">La Galissonnière：</span><br>
Aw shit! It's Le Terrible!<br>
Hang on, where the heck did you even come from?<br>
I just checked around and didn't see anyone but Joffre here!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Terrible：</span><br>
I'm sure you can guess. May I ask why you're here, La Galissonnière? Were you accompanying Joffre?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Joffre：</span><br>
No. She simply came here on a whim, as she usually does.<br>
And now she made a fool of herself in front of the Holy Iris. I say we make her atone with some prayer.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Terrible：</span><br>
Naturally, the more, the better. I wholeheartedly agree.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">La Galissonnière：</span><br>
I don't! Respect my right to pray on my own terms!<br>
It's always prayer this, atonement that with you two, I swear...<br>
Listen to this though. Apparently, the Tribunal discovered a handful of our relics being smuggled out recently... And guess what?<br>
It seems that the Iron Blood's bigwigs are involved!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Terrible：</span><br>
Relics? What manner of relics are we talking about?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">La Galissonnière：</span><br>
The sacred kind. Stuff that should be in a cathedral or a palace.<br>
Got your attention? You wanna come with me and see what that's all about?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Terrible：</span><br>
I'd be lying if I said no, but I have other, more immediate business to tend to. I'm afraid I cannot accompany you on this informal investigation.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">La Galissonnière：</span><br>
Meh, what a stick in the mud... What about you, Joffre? You said you had work, right?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Joffre：</span><br>
Unfortunately, yes. We're hosting a party for the Royal Navy, which I expect to take up most of my day.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">La Galissonnière：</span><br>
That's today? Bummer...<br>
Guess Detective Gali is goin' solo. Enjoy your "work" and all.<br>
<br>
A short while later, Joffre found herself alone in the cathedral once more.<br>
She shot glances in the different directions La Galissonnière and Le Terrible had left, then gave a parting prayer to the Iris sculpture.<br>

<br>
2 The Knight-Princess and Her Sisters<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Joffre：</span><br>
The party venue is just up ahead. Judging from how extravagant this place looks, there must be some really important people showing up.<br>
<br>
Joffre stepped into a park near the building the party was being held in.<br>
As she walked through the greenery, she heard a set of voices coming from around a corner ahead of her.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">???：</span><br>
This is not the place for that. Can't you at least hang in until we get to the waiting room?<br>
No, I can't move a muscle... I'm too exhausted...<br>
I need you to rub me down here... We're the only ones around, so nobody has to know.<br>
Come on, please. Do it for your big sister.<br>
Well... If you insist, then fine. Just relax.<br>
Mmmm~ Oh, that feels so good~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Joffre：</span><br>
What... the...<br>
......<br>
What in the world are they doing out in this park?<br>
A little peek can't hurt, right...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Malin：</span><br>
Ohhh... Oww... It hurts... It hurts so good...!<br>
Up here, please. Here, too... Yeah, rub 'em good~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">L'Indomptable：</span><br>
Your arms? As you say...<br>
You know, I think this is excessive for a break. You should consider improving your physique and endurance.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Malin：</span><br>
Ehh...? I'm just keeping an eye on my energy expenditure though. Wouldn't want to run out of juice when you're on the battlefield, right?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">L'Indomptable：</span><br>
Oh, I see! That makes perfect sense!<br>
Le Triomphant, let's both help her conserve her energy!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Triomphant：</span><br>
Sorry, but no. Spoiling her any more than we already do would set a bad precedent.<br>
Could we please get going now? We must report to Lady Clemenceau as soon as possible.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Malin：</span><br>
I know, but I'm seriously too tired to take one more step...<br>
Look, I'll do the hard part of the report if you just let me enjoy my massage for another five minutes.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Triomphant：</span><br>
Well, I suppose I can't blame you for being exhausted... You worked harder than anyone else during this mission, after all.<br>
Your calves look quite tense. Allow me to massage them.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Malin：</span><br>
Ah... I'm truly blessed to have sisters as great as you two...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Joffre：</span><br>
So that's all it is... The Knight-Princess and her sisters have just come back from a mission.<br>
Hard work does not excuse sloth, for sloth is a deadly sin. If others heard of this, it could very well cancel out the merit she just earned.<br>
However, seeing as nobody else is around...<br>
I think it'll be fine to turn a blind eye this time.<br>

<br>
3 The Cardinal and the Privateer<br>
Joffre arrived at the waiting room and quickly realized she wasn't the only one there.<br>
She was about to knock on the door when she heard a pair of voices debating on the other side.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Joffre：</span><br>
That sounds like Cardinal Richelieu and Jean Bart...<br>
<br>
The two kept on talking, unaware that Joffre was just on the other side of the door.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Richelieu：</span><br>
And that is all that was discussed at the assembly. From questions about the Iris Orthodoxy's future, to the operations to take place across Europa...<br>
The talks were in line with what we expected. Everything went smoothly... Maybe even too smoothly.<br>
It leads me to suspect that Bismarck is up to something... Or perhaps, that our own higher-ups are planning something.<br>
I asked Clemenceau this same question, but... what do you think about all this?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jean Bart：</span><br>
Since you're askin', I'll get straight to the point.<br>
Bismarck's a shark that smells blood in the water. And one way or another, we're gonna be the ones made to bleed.<br>
Recovering and reverse-engineering Siren technology, turning their own tools against them... It all sounds grand and marvelous, doesn't it?<br>
But you've heard the rumors too, haven't you? About what's on the horizon...<br>
I don't know how much the Templar Knights know, but I do know we've got to start preparing for what's comin'. The losses will be unimaginable if we don't.<br>
Someone needs to get the Tribunal and the Orthodoxy's higher-ups to start gathering intel.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Richelieu：</span><br>
Yes. Clemenceau said the same thing.<br>
However, we must not make hasty decisions. It would only cause friction between the factions.<br>
The Iris' future shall never be threatened for as long as our homeland and the Basilica remain ours. Not even Iron Blood can challenge that fact.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jean Bart：</span><br>
Yeah, true, but that's betting a lot on the Orthodoxy doing as we hope. Maybe I'm being paranoid, but still...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Richelieu：</span><br>
It's alright. I've asked the Tribunal and Le Terrible to look into it. It's no use for us to fret over this issue.<br>
Let us not forget Queen Elizabeth also has her plans. All we can do for now is...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Joffre：</span><br>
...Oh dear. This was not meant for my ears.<br>
No, this is definitely not something a regular shipgirl like me should know. I will do my best to forget it.<br>
I'll bid the Cardinal good day another time. For now, I'd better hurry to the main hall.<br>
<br>
Joffre pushed this forbidden knowledge out of her mind, then turned around and ran off to the party venue.<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Maillé Brézé：</span><br>
For the last time! Thou art not allowed inside!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">L'Opiniâtre：</span><br>
Tem, let's just go home. We're not getting in without our invitations...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Téméraire：</span><br>
We have them, we just forgot them! Please, Maillé! You know we can be trusted!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Maillé Brézé：</span><br>
Hmph! When I say no, I mean NO! The Cardinal herself personally entrusted me with this post! Today is the one day I will make no exceptions!<br>
If you truly got invitations, then why can't you head back to your rooms and fetch them?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Téméraire：</span><br>
Well... the thing is, I don't want to miss out on the pastries they're serving just for this party!<br>
It's a long way back to the dormitory, you know? The pastries will be gone by the time we're back!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">L'Opiniâtre：</span><br>
They're not even meant for you, Tem. They're for the Royal Navy guests...<br>
If it's pastries you want, just ask Dunkerque to make some for you later and I'm sure she'll oblige.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Téméraire：</span><br>
I know that, but they invited us too, remember? So we're guests too! And besides, I want pastries NOW!<br>
Hey, I know! If you let us in, we'll act as little cultural ambassadors for the Royal Navy girls! We'll tell them what the pastries are named and how good they are and so on!<br>
I mean, what if you turn us away, suddenly become short-staffed, and then can't treat your dear guests properly? That'd be terrible!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Maillé Brézé：</span><br>
D-don't go around making up increasingly fantastical scenarios!<br>
The Cardinal gave me explicit orders – any who wish to enter must present an invitation! So do you have an invitation or not, Le Téméraire?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Téméraire：</span><br>
I don't, but I promise I can give the guests the party of their lives! Please, you have to let me in!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Maillé Brézé：</span><br>
Thou shalt not pass! If you insist on passing, you'll have to get through me! Heh heh~!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Téméraire：</span><br>
Ugh, you leave us no choice... C'mon, Opie, we're gonna make a break for it!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Joffre：</span><br>
...What in the world are you people doing? Are you trying to make us look bad?<br>
If you want pastries so badly, I'll save some for you. Now hurry back and grab your invitations.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Téméraire：</span><br>
Thanks, Joffre! You're so sweet!<br>
Sorry for bothering you, Maillé! C'mon, Opie, let's be quick!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Joffre：</span><br>
Gluttony is a sin, but in light of your service to–<br>
...Oh. They're gone.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Maillé Brézé：</span><br>
Thanks for getting them out of my hair, Joffre!<br>
That said, had Le Téméraire tried to sprint past me, I would simply have subdued her by force if necessary!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Joffre：</span><br>
While your devotion to your duty is exemplary, think about the sheer chaos that would've broken out if the two of you really started fighting out here.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Maillé Brézé：</span><br>
Ugh, I didn't even think of that... I'm sorry...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Joffre：</span><br>
Don't worry about it. I'm not here to get you in trouble.<br>
By the way, has the Royal Navy arrived?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Maillé Brézé：</span><br>
Not yet, but they should be here shortly.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Joffre：</span><br>
Very well, then I will wait for them inside. Here is my invitation.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Maillé Brézé：</span><br>
Splendid – everything checks out! Welcome in!<br>

Party Venue - Entrance Corridor<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jeanne d'Arc：</span><br>
Were you the one who settled the commotion going on outside? Blessed be you and the Holy Iris.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Joffre：</span><br>
It was no big deal. Could you hear them from all the way in here?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jeanne d'Arc：</span><br>
Of course. Those two girls don't exactly have indoor voices.<br>
Algérie was about this close to bringing a tray of pastries out there herself.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Joffre：</span><br>
I see, I must've come at a good time then. The Holy Iris guides us in all we do.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Algérie：</span><br>
You were a great help, Joffre. Otherwise, I would've had to order another batch of pastries before the Royal Navy showed up.<br>
Has the Cardinal not arrived yet?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Joffre：</span><br>
She should be speaking with Jean Bart in the waiting room.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Algérie：</span><br>
I see. Hopefully things went well, as we need our Royal Navy allies more than ever now.<br>
Jeanne and I are going to take another lap around the venue to make sure everything is in order, so I'll leave you to check in our guests.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Joffre：</span><br>
Howe of the Royal Knights, Newcastle of the Southampton class...<br>
King George V's little sister, and the former head of the Royal Maids too...<br>
That's a star-studded lineup we've got here. The Royal Navy apparently sees this as a very serious occasion as well.<br>
Will the words that have been spoken behind closed doors remain the same before the Queen's presence?<br>
As someone who only can "judge," that is well beyond my control.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Algérie：</span><br>
Joffre, they've arrived.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Joffre：</span><br>
Alright. I trust you'll be looking after them well.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Algérie：</span><br>
Indeed, just as we agreed on.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Joffre：</span><br>
I'm ready as well. Let us begin this party.<br>

<br>
6 The Party<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Algérie：</span><br>
Thank you for coming all this way to be with us, my esteemed guests of the Royal Navy.<br>
We are honored to greet you on behalf of Cardinal Richelieu.<br>
We are aware that it may be difficult to find room in your hearts for merriment after the grueling war against the Sirens...<br>
But today only, we urge you to set that aside and enjoy the hospitality the Iris Orthodoxy has to offer so that we may strengthen the bonds between us.<br>
Once again, let us toast to our continuing friendship.<br>
May the Holy Iris guide us. Glory to Her Majesty the Queen.<br>
<br>
After the toast, the participants at the venue started to chat cordially to the backdrop of light music.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Howe ：</span><br>
Not a bad selection of music here. They've got some favourites from the Royal Islands in addition to the classical.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Newcastle：</span><br>
Yes, they definitely rolled out the red carpet for us.<br>
The selection of music not only helps us relax, but also provides a sense of familiarity and being back home.<br>
As far as the food goes, though, the main emphasis is definitely Iris cuisine.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Howe ：</span><br>
That's fine, isn't it? Its refined, delicate taste perfectly suits an occasion like this.<br>
Now that I think about it, we sometimes prefer to serve Iris cuisine even when hosting our own parties, no?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Newcastle：</span><br>
That's true. These dishes reflect the kind of peace that we strive towards – a perfect selection, if you ask me.<br>
Having said that, as a member of the Royal Maids, I do have immense pride in our desserts.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Howe ：</span><br>
Right, maybe you can see if you can help out in the kitchen. Heehee, I'm sure nobody will object to having more delicious food.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Newcastle：</span><br>
I'll do just that. Enterprise, let's head over right now.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
Understood. I'll be right there.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Howe ：</span><br>
Oh my... If I'm not mistaken, you're the Iris Orthodoxy's... Miss Joffre?<br>
I am Howe of the King George V class. It's a pleasure to make your acquaintance.<br>
Would you like to try some of our sweets?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Joffre：</span><br>
Oh, thanks.<br>
(This sweet fragrance... It must be a freshly-baked cookie.)<br>
There aren't any cookies on today's menu, are there?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Howe ：</span><br>
Correct. But our hardworking Royal Maids aren't used to sitting back and relaxing, so they went to help out in the kitchen.<br>
It never hurts to have more delicious food to satisfy more people, right?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Joffre：</span><br>
I see... So the Royal Maids made this...<br>
Allow me to have a taste.<br>
<br>
Joffre savored the cookie she was given, then noticed Howe was staring at her.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Joffre：</span><br>
Did I get something stuck on my face... Um, Miss Howe?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Howe ：</span><br>
Ah, no... I apologise for my rudeness!<br>
I was just a bit surprised by the wings of light that appeared from your back.<br>
They make you look like an angel.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Joffre：</span><br>
You flatter me, Miss Howe.<br>
Though, now that you mention the word "angel"... Some shipgirls in the Iris Orthodoxy are indeed given that name.<br>
Even though it's more a description of functionality, it is still an extraordinary honor for me to hold one of the Iris Orthodoxy's sacraments...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Howe ：</span><br>
You even have the humility to boot. Maybe you are a bona fide angel~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Joffre：</span><br>
Y-you're going to make me blush...<br>
<br>
The wings on her back fluttered slightly, as if in reaction to Joffre's emotions.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Howe ：</span><br>
*gasp*...! Um, may I... please touch your wings?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Joffre：</span><br>
It's not strictly forbidden, but allowing someone to touch the sacraments is...<br>
Never mind, I'll allow it. Consider it a fair trade for that delicious cookie you gave me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Howe ：</span><br>
Thank you very much! Now, don't mind if I do...<br>
Oh? My, oh my... They seem illusory but still have a nice, feathery feel...<br>
Ahh, thanks, that was amazing. Anyway, I'm quite good at baking cookies as well. My friends have no shortage of good things to say about them~<br>
I just arrived today so I'm still getting settled in, but I can try to have some for you tomorrow if you'd like.<br>
I'm sure you'd like to try some of my fluffy, freshly-made cookies, right? Hehe~♪<br>
...Oh! I hope I'm not bothering you with all my rambling!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Joffre：</span><br>
Um, sure, if you aren't busy tomorrow.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Howe ：</span><br>
Alright then! I'll be waiting tomorrow at the mansion we're staying at.<br>
<br>
Meanwhile, Algérie was watching the two of them chatting away.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Algérie：</span><br>
There's not much time left before Joffre has to give her speech...<br>
But, it's rare for that girl to get opportunities like this, especially considering her line of "work."<br>
I suppose I should also enjoy the party. Maybe I'll take a look at what kinds of sweets the Royal Maids are making.<br>

7 The End of the Day<br>
Once the party came to a close, the Royal Navy guests headed for the mansion they'd be staying at. Joffre, meanwhile, was about to leave for the Iris dormitory.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">L'Indomptable：</span><br>
It's gotten late. I will walk you to the dorm.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Joffre：</span><br>
I do appreciate the thought, but I can walk there myself.<br>
This is the Iris Orthodoxy. Few places in the world are as safe as here.<br>
Even if I ran into some miscreants, we both know how that would end.<br>
Shouldn't you be heading back as well? Or were you tasked with standing guard here?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">L'Indomptable：</span><br>
Not exactly. I'm just wrapping something up.<br>
Or was. I'm having no success, so I'll just leave now.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Joffre：</span><br>
...Did you drop something, by any chance?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">L'Indomptable：</span><br>
Yes, actually! How did you figure that out?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Joffre：</span><br>
Heehee. Call it my intuition. You'll likely find it somewhere in the grass around here.<br>
Out of curiosity, what was it you dropped?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">L'Indomptable：</span><br>
My hairband.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Joffre：</span><br>
The left or the right one?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">L'Indomptable：</span><br>
Um... The right one.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Joffre：</span><br>
Hmm... Considering where Le Malin laid and where you sat while massaging her...<br>
There we are. Is this it?<br>
<br>
Joffre picked up the hairband from the grass and showed it to L'Indomptable.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">L'Indomptable：</span><br>
THAT was fast! Yes, that's the one!<br>
You have the eyes of an eagle! It's no wonder you're on the Tribunal.<br>
Thank you very much!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Joffre：</span><br>
Oh please, it was nothing.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">L'Indomptable：</span><br>
You mentioned me massaging Le Malin... You saw that disgraceful sight earlier today, did you?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Joffre：</span><br>
Who says I saw anything, hmm? Now that you've found your hairband, it's time you go home and get some well-earned rest.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">L'Indomptable：</span><br>
If you say so... You should do the same.<br>
<br>
Back at the dormitory, a girl kneeled in a room bathed in moonlight.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Joffre：</span><br>
Praised be the Holy Iris' light. May it always guide us.<br>
I must visit Howe at the mansion tomorrow. I'll go there after I've said my prayers.<br>
I'm curious to see what her homemade cookies taste like.<br>
...Ah. I see La Galissonnière has stopped by.<br>
<br>
She saw that a note had been lazily left on her pillow.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Joffre：</span><br>
"The Tribunal's meeting is tomorrow! You're expected to be there!"<br>
"P.S.: I said a prayer like you told me to earlier!"<br>
A meeting, I see... That must mean there's more "work" to do. I'll have to save the cookies for after that.<br>
O, Holy Iris, we thank you for watching over us today. I pray we will have your protection tomorrow and the day after as well.<br>
Please grace us with your blessings so we may live in peace forever more.<br>
<br>
Grasping the note tightly in her hands, she offered another prayer in the moonlight.<br>
