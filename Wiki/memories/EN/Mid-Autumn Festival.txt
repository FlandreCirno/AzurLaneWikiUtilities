<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
Smells so good~<br>
Wow...the source of this aromatic smell is coming from the Dragon Empery. Ehhh... let me hide first, I will give them a surprise! Hehehe~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ning Hai：</span><br>
It's finally the day for sister Yat Sen to unseal her secret osmanthus wine! Oh wow... this aroma is really hypnotizing~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yat Sen：</span><br>
Haha, if you don't make mooncakes good enough to match my wine, you won't get a single sip!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ning Hai：</span><br>
I see! Ning Hai is ready to cook!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ping Hai：</span><br>
Sister is being more dedicated than me, for the first time...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yat Sen：</span><br>
Even though there're only three of us, the festivities are still as happy as before...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ning Hai&Ping Hai：</span><br>
……<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yat Sen：</span><br>
...Sorry, I've lost my train of thought... but as long as we're still here, one day sooner or later, everyone will gather here together again.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ning Hai：</span><br>
Yes... the Mid-Autumn Festival is one that celebrates a reunion with friends and family.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ping Hai：</span><br>
Say, isn't the Mid-Autumn Festival all about eating mooncakes?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
….celebrating a reunion…?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yat Sen：</span><br>
Who's there!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
Ack---?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yat Sen：</span><br>
Look who it is. A lady not lady-like at all.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
I am a lady --- at the very least, a little bit!<br>
But... this is definitely very humiliating for me, since I’ve been discovered before I can pull my prank!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yat Sen：</span><br>
“Prank”, this kind of word is not supposed to be said by a lady.<br>
……<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
I understand! So it seems that the Mid-Autumn Festival is one that “celebrates the reunion with friends and family”, but…how come it seems like such a downer right now? In the Dragon Empery, all festivals should be very lively!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yat Sen：</span><br>
Words can be hurtful... even if they tell the truth.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ping Hai：</span><br>
Whoaaa——Sister Yat Sen, you're joking, right?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yat Sen：</span><br>
~Stares~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
S-Sorry! Th-the second sister made me a bit scared when she appeared!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ning Hai：</span><br>
After all, it's not like Christmas, the Mid-Autumn Festival is not as popular around the world yet.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ping Hai：</span><br>
Although, I feel like Mid-Autumn Festival is better than Christmas -- food-wise!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
Is it popular around the world...I get it now! Anyone can celebrate the Mid-Autumn Festival, right?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ning Hai：</span><br>
Umm….yes you're right, but----<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
Well then, wait for me a bit. This damper of an atmosphere is no festival at all, a festival should be livelier!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ping Hai：</span><br>
She just comes and goes like a puff of smoke...Eagle Union carriers are amazing!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yat Sen：</span><br>
That little troublemaker, she may be pretty cute after all...<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
I brought my sister here.Ta-da!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lexington：</span><br>
Good afternoon everyone from the Dragon Empery~ Um, I heard from Saratoga that you are celebrating a festival called the “Mid-Autumn Festival”.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ning Hai：</span><br>
Oh wow, is this Sara's big sister? So beautiful! Will Sara also grow up to be so pretty?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
……<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yat Sen：</span><br>
Yes, do you wish to join us Ms. Lexington?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lexington：</span><br>
Of course~ how can a festival be missing an idol like myself! Will you allow me to join you in the celebrations, too?! Also, how come you address my sister as “Lady Sara”, but call me “Miss Lexington?” You can call me “Lady Lex!”<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ning Hai：</span><br>
Welcome welcome~ although there is no say of inviting idols to this festival...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yat Sen：</span><br>
Lady Lex...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lexington：</span><br>
GOOD! Although... even though it's a celebration, I'm still unclear in exactly how we should celebrate the Mid-Autumn Festival?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yat Sen：</span><br>
It's about a gathering of friends and family, everyone sits together wishing for fortune and happiness, as well as reminiscing about the past with loved ones.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lexington：</span><br>
Isn't this a bit like Memorial Day in the Eagle Union?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ning Hai：</span><br>
No…most likely...not...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lexington：</span><br>
But to me, these two festivals both sound similar? It's all about commemorating our…<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
I'm still alive... not a martyr yet...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lexington：</span><br>
So sorry, I lost track of my words~ anyways, is the preparation for the festival almost finished? Is there anything else that my sister and I can help with?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yat Sen：</span><br>
No need, the guests should just relax --- Hey! Where are those Ping Hai and Ning Hai sisters?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
We're making lanterns! Ping Hai told me that it's a tradition during the Mid-Autumn Festival?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ping Hai：</span><br>
When talking about the Mid-Autumn Festival, other than mooncakes and osmanthus wine, the lantern is definitely a must-have traditional item!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ning Hai：</span><br>
Oh no….where did you put the mooncakes...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ping Hai：</span><br>
In short, with the help of Lady Sara, the lanterns were finished in no time! Those carriers sure are amazing!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ning Hai：</span><br>
Wow….so many lanterns, we'll definitely be able to attract good fortune and protection---<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
At night, let my sister and I “fly up” to those lanterns. That way, not only will they shine but they'll also emanate a beautiful sound, like a “dance in the sky”! My friends are also eager to try on these festive clothes!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ping Hai：</span><br>
A bunch of lanterns roaring and dancing up in the sky...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ning Hai：</span><br>
This isn't what we want to have for the festival...<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yat Sen：</span><br>
….Where are those Mid-Autumn tides…obviously we're clearing the seaport, but there's no hope for rain...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ning Hai：</span><br>
After all, tidal waves differ from coast to coast...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lexington：</span><br>
Also, since it's chosen as a seaport...naturally the tidal waves will not be too strong...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yat Sen：</span><br>
How could I have made such a stupid mistake...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ping Hai：</span><br>
Yan Set sister is motionless like a fossil---<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ning Hai：</span><br>
After all, she was eagerly anticipating for rain during the Mid-Autumn Festival<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ping Hai：</span><br>
……<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lexington：</span><br>
Huh? Seems like there is a sound that's coming closer<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">？？？：</span><br>
I've already changed into my swimsuit, don't be shy now, Hood~<br>
I said I'll only accompany you to the beach, I didn't promise you that I'll change into a swimsuit. Also, swimming in cold waters during the Autumn season is no demeanor of a lady.<br>
Sister Hood…but I saw you only yesterday practicing on your swimming in the sea, so----<br>
Cy-g-net!!!!<br>
Ahhhh!!!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lexington：</span><br>
Oh, that child over there is rushing towards us, so fast! What's the name of that Destroyer again?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
Ugh...no, I don't want to be traumatized anymore. Let's book it----<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=Mid-Autumn Festival 4|选项=4|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
Wow, it's Cleveland and Helena!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cleveland：</span><br>
I was lured here by this sweet aroma, I didn't expect to meet you girls here.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
This sweet aroma... what's this? Some kind of scented wine?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yat Sen：</span><br>
It's my secret osmanthus wine~ But I didn't expect you all to be attracted by the scent. Did I not seal it properly?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
No... Cleveland sniffed the scent of the faint aroma, then pestered me to use my SG radar to track its location. Even if there are others who picked up on the smell, they should not be able to locate the source.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ning Hai：</span><br>
Here is someone who found the source of the aroma before you ---<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yat Sen：</span><br>
Since you're already here, how about staying for dinner since it's already getting late? Today we're celebrating a festival from the Dragon Empery — the Mid-Autumn Festival!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cleveland：</span><br>
Today was suppose to be my turn to cook, right….OK! Let's stay! I've gotten off easy!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
If you don't cook today, you'll still cook tomorrow. I've admired the cuisine from the Dragon Empery for a long time now. Yat Sen, will you be able to open my eyes and shatter my expectations tonight?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yat Sen：</span><br>
Of course. The highlight of tonight's meal are “mooncakes”, which symbolizes harmony and reunion. We haven't finished making them yet, do you want to see the process of how they're being made?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
Thank you, don't mind if I do<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yat Sen：</span><br>
Ping Hai and Ning Hai, please take out the ingredients---<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
Sis, let's make them together! Let's see who can make them better!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lexington：</span><br>
I feel like you're very excited today... fine, I'll show everyone here the strength of “Lady Lex”!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cleveland：</span><br>
Ah! This looks very interesting, Helena, let's join them?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
？<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cleveland：</span><br>
This way, I can consider this as cooking! So for tomorrow---<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
Don't be so lazy…...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
Yeah! I'm done at last - yay, was I the slowest? With help from others, I thought could've at least finished in the middle...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ping Hai：</span><br>
You spent so much time kneading the dough<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yat Sen：</span><br>
So, the mooncakes have started baking, let's take a short break before we start our Mid-Autumn Festival dinner.<br>
In addition, before we start dinner, please allow me to express my gratitude for everyone's attendance!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lexington：</span><br>
No worries~ it's more like my sister has been causing so much mischief for you all.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
No I haven't!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
It's an honor to be able to eat food hand-made by Yan Set and Ning Hai.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cleveland：</span><br>
Haha! I didn't do anything, although --- the liveliness is what counts for making it a festival!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lexington：</span><br>
That's true...festivals are all about the rowdy atmosphere!<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ping Hai：</span><br>
Ta-da<nowiki>~~~~</nowiki> Here is the debut of Ping Hai's Mid-Autumn Festival attire!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ning Hai：</span><br>
I'm so s-shy...Yat Sen's gift...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
Wow! So beautiful---<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
Say….is this also a “custom” for the Mid-Autumn Festival?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yat Sen：</span><br>
No it's not, but because Ping Hai and Ning Hai have been so hard working, I wanted to give them both a little reward~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cleveland：</span><br>
Was... was this hand-stitched?! My my Helena... we’re no match for them!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
...I can't seem to be able to hear the criticisms.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ning Hai：</span><br>
In any case, let's start the meal! I want to drink that osmanthus wine!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yat Sen：</span><br>
Of course! O what a lovely full moon tonight. Let's finish all this osmanthus wine everyone, hehehe--- Oh! But be sure to leave some for the Moon Goddess<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lexington：</span><br>
So is this...is this Sara's mooncakes?......<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
...big Sisterrrr…<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lexington：</span><br>
Hmmm, ~nibbles~...Sara you still have room to improve...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ning Hai：</span><br>
One look and you can tell that it's not edible... yet you swallowed it… such close sibling affection!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ping Hai：</span><br>
Lady Lex's mooncakes looks delicious, ~nibbles~ but still the taste is not the same as lady Yat Sen's.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yat Sen：</span><br>
Your mooncakes not only turned out to be pizza-shaped, but they even tasted like pizza? I'm not sure if I can call this a clever trick or----<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
Cleveland, did you really get Yat Sen to teach you her methods? The more I look at yours, the more I think it resembles a burrito.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cleveland：</span><br>
Haha! I mixed all those ingredients together disproportionately! Is there a problem? It's all going to end up in your stomach anyway!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
It-it's definitely not the same! If it wasn't ~coughs~, ~coughs~.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cleveland：</span><br>
Tsk tsk, talking with a mouthful, would you care for some osmanthus wine?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yat Sen：</span><br>
Looks like the only person who actually made “mooncakes” was me. Ning Hai, Helena... Ping Hai, wait, how did your mooncakes turn out to be steamed buns instead?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ping Hai：</span><br>
Hehehe~ Sara borrowed the mooncake molds from me… I like to eat steamed buns so it doesn't matter, I can eat all of these by myself!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yat Sen：</span><br>
Heyy...don't hide these like it's buried treasure… I haven't tried mooncake flavored buns before! Nibbles~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ning Hai：</span><br>
Ping Hai, let's share these.<br>
Sister...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yat Sen：</span><br>
Sister… don’t choke on your food, here, drink some osmanthus wine~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ning Hai：</span><br>
Mmmm, so fragrant….<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cleveland：</span><br>
Tastes so so good! Give me ten barrels, then the cavalry of the ocean will be yours to command!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yat Sen：</span><br>
First do this, then add this….and then….<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
Oh, I'll have to write this all down! If I have trouble making this, can I still ask you for advice?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yat Sen：</span><br>
Of course~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
Sis, can I drink some, too?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lexington：</span><br>
Just a little bit~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Everyone：</span><br>
Moon Goddess, here's a toast to everyone who, whether being here or not, I wish that everyone can be united with their loved ones.<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prince of Wales：</span><br>
The aroma leads us here, uh... it seems we are not alone.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
What a mess. Was there some sort of a celebration...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cleveland：</span><br>
It's a festival! The Mid-Autumn Festival!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yat Sen：</span><br>
Huh? New guests? They must have been attracted by the smell of my osmanthus wine. Welcome~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z46：</span><br>
Those wines... Are they the source of the aroma?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yat Sen：</span><br>
Yes. We only have that much left. They are too fragile though. Let's put down our hatred towards each other, at least just for today.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z46：</span><br>
I don't drink, and there's nothing to be put down... But —— it smells really good~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vampire：</span><br>
It's not as red as blood! But it tastes good~~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ning Hai：</span><br>
Hey! Stop there! Wine thivees!<br>
Wales~ Can I have a h-hug~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ping Hai：</span><br>
With a touch of alcohol, my sister becomes a troublemaker...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prince of Wales：</span><br>
This is her charm point~ Come, let me hold you high.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yat Sen：</span><br>
I didn't except that so many people would come... all thanks to you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
I think it's because we all miss those we lost, friends, family... We cannot help ourselves thinking about them under such a beautiful moon, even if this isn't a festival for reunion... That's why we're all here together, right?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yat Sen：</span><br>
Are there other people staring at the same moon, and celebrating? Tonight, I believe there are.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prince of Wales：</span><br>
Even though festivals are different from cultures, they are in common in many emotional ways. The meaning of the Mid-Autumn Festival is to miss our family and friends, and to celebrate our reunion. These are universal among all cultures. I wish there would be more people join us next year~~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cleveland：</span><br>
Yes. My sisters and Helena's sisters... and all past friends, rivals, enemies... I wish everyone could be here.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yat Sen：</span><br>
Are all the wine gone... Oh, yes! There's a custom from my hometown... Cake Game. Let's have some fun!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prince of Wales：</span><br>
Cake Game?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ping Hai：</span><br>
But I ate all the mooncakes... I, I mean we...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yat Sen：</span><br>
Let's roll dices, and the winner gets a mooncake~~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prince of Wales：</span><br>
Huh... something like a roulette?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yat Sen：</span><br>
Yes, they are quite similar. Except the rewards are mooncakes... Did I hear the mooncakes are all gone? Let's use these lanterns then. Write down your wishes on them, then let fly... high to the rim of the world.<br>
So that, all your friends, and even God will hear our wishes. Saratoga, are your drunken carriers still capable to fly?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
Of course! They cannot wait!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yat Sen：</span><br>
Many thanks~ Those who know the rules, let's show the others how to play Cake Game~~<br>

{{折叠面板|标题=Mid-Autumn Festival 7|选项=7|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yat Sen：</span><br>
So, the first flower goes to... Prince of Wales! There you go, write down your wishes here.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prince of Wales：</span><br>
Emmm….do I have to write it in front of everyone?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Hmm? Is there something that you can’t tell us?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prince of Wales：</span><br>
Haha~ of course note, I’ll write it then --- “I hope that every girl can show her true smile”...OK!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yat Sen：</span><br>
Z46! Here, write something~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z46：</span><br>
...I hope that everyone on Azur Lane can get the chance to relax...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prince of Wales：</span><br>
Wow, such pretty handwriting!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lexington：</span><br>
Sara sit still, the next round will start soon! This time I must...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yat Sen：</span><br>
Saratoga --- You write, too!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
“I hope I get to experience more interesting things” --- OK!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lexington：</span><br>
Shouldn’t you be writing well-wishes for your fellow shipgirls?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
Hmm? Then isn’t being able to get together with all of you the most interesting thing ever!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yat Sen：</span><br>
Lastly --- Yat Sen! Hehe, it’s my turn this time~<br>
So...what should I write then?<br>
“I hope that everyone will get new clothes for next year”...let’s say that!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prince of Wales：</span><br>
New clothes... there are those who also like to wear uniforms...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
……<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yat Sen：</span><br>
Second place goes to... Eugen!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Hmmm, I’ve been given a second place?!<br>
Then…”I hope to be able to get together with my sisters”, is that ok?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prince of Wales：</span><br>
I feel like suddenly thinking out loud “ha!” ...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yat Sen：</span><br>
Finally, the first place... Ning Hai!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ning Hai：</span><br>
What!? I'm the first place! Great!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ping Hai：</span><br>
I wanna be on the first place as well...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yat Sen：</span><br>
So, Ning Hai, have you decided on your wish?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ning Hai：</span><br>
Yes, from the very beginning... I wish more and more friends will join us!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prince of Wales：</span><br>
All the lanterns flew away, out of our reach.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yat Sen：</span><br>
Yet the moon is still up there, looking over all of us. No matter how far the distance, we share the same beautiful scene with those we care but cannot be together...<br>

I hope that one day all of us will be as whole and complete as the full moon tonight, all sitting together side by side...<br>

Whether it’s next year or the year after, as long as I’m around, I will always come to celebrate. I haven’t had enough of this osmanthus wine!<br>

So... Let us pray to the Moon Goddess together.<br>
Wish today's joy will reunit us here every year. Wish never will we be alone in the sea, and be defeated by pain and failure... Wish everyone start understanding each other... Wish we can hold our hands forever...<br>
