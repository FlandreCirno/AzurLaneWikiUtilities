The Queen of Adventure<br>
<br>
1 Ace Up Her Sleeve<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fei Yuen：</span><br>
Commaaandeeer! It's time to embark on another adventure with Lady Yuen!<br>
<br>
The door to my office swings open, and in comes Fei Yuen, shouting and breaking the silence.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
No can do, sorry. I still have work to do, so we'll have to save that adventure for tomorrow.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fei Yuen：</span><br>
Hmph. Tomorrow, tomorrow, it's always tomorrow with you...<br>
You have some nerve, expecting Lady Yuen to wait a whole day for you!<br>
Oh, I know! If work is the problem then I'll help you finish it!<br>
It'll be done before you know it, and then we can go on our adventure!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I could use the help, don't get me wrong, but...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fei Yuen：</span><br>
But?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
First, I'll have to gauge your ability.<br>
Don't worry, it's a simple test with just one question.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fei Yuen：</span><br>
I can do that! Ask away!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Okay...<br>
There's a kitchen sink filled with water. It has a tap and three drainage pipes.<br>
While the tap is running, the sink can be completely drained in 30 minutes by opening one of the pipes.<br>
Under the same circumstances, the sink can be completely drained in 10 minutes by opening two pipes.<br>
So, here's the question. The tap is running and the sink is full. If you open all three pipes, how long does it take for the sink to drain?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fei Yuen：</span><br>
...What?<br>
Err... Umm...<br>
MY question is, who the HECK keeps the tap running if their goal is to drain the sink?!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
That's beside the point. What's your answer?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fei Yuen：</span><br>
My answer is... I dunno!<br>
I believe in saying "I don't know" if you don't know the answer! It's called sincerity, and it's a virtue!<br>
How's that? Do I pass the test?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
No, that's an F. I'm afraid I can't let you help.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fei Yuen：</span><br>
Aww... I had a feeling you'd be a tough nut to crack...<br>
But the last laugh shall be mine!<br>
See, I got Master Hai Tien to teach me many things before I came here!<br>
I'm gonna argue you into submission using Empery poetry and proverbs! Then you'll HAVE to go with me on a grand adventure!<br>
Put simply, what needs to be done today needs to be done today! Don't leave anything for tomorrow!<br>
Put poetically, "The morrow follows the morrow, of which there are many. The one who waits for the morrow lets all be for naught."<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Man, that's deep.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fei Yuen：</span><br>
Exactly! So let's be quick and–<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
As you yourself said, this needs to be done today. I can't afford to waste any time!<br>
That means I can't go on adventures with you. Sorry.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fei Yuen：</span><br>
Huh? But Master Hai Tien said...<br>
Oh! You sly devil, you!<br>
Fine! Then I have to use the ace up my sleeve!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
You still have more?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fei Yuen：</span><br>
Heehee... It's vital to keep it secret until it's time to reveal it. You can't know about it before then!<br>
I'm gonna leave now, but I'll be baaack!<br>
<br>
She turns around and leaves my office with no further antics.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(No trickery or anything? She just... left? This doesn't feel normal.)<br>
(She did glance at the teapot on my table before she left, though.)<br>
(Did she... put something in it?)<br>
<br>
I pour the liquid into a cup. The color looks normal, though the aroma smells a bit odd.<br>
After thinking it through, I decide to take just a small sip.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Pffftttt!<br>
This tastes like guaiwei!<br>

The Queen of Adventure<br>
<br>
2 Caught Red-Handed?<br>
After eating dinner, I decide to go for a walk. That's when I hear a voice coming from an empty spot of land.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fei Yuen：</span><br>
I swear it wasn't me! This is a misunderstanding!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Huan Ch'ang：</span><br>
All the evidence points to you, Fei Yuen. Just admit you did it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hu Pen：</span><br>
Lung Wu flew off the handle from drinking that tea you spiked with some weird stuff!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fei Yuen：</span><br>
It wasn't me! I didn't spike the tea! I haven't done anything!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chen Hai：</span><br>
Really? Nothing?<br>
Then what were you doing with a teapot full of foul tea when I came into the kitchen?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fei Yuen：</span><br>
I was just... That's unrelated! It wasn't me, okay?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Valiant：</span><br>
What a racket. I heard you lot from all the way over there.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vanguard：</span><br>
So that's why the tea tasted so off. Fei Yuen put something in it as a prank.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Implacable：</span><br>
I thought it gave the tea a unique flavour profile.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Warspite：</span><br>
There is such a thing as TOO unique, you know.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Look at that. Our little adventurer has been caught.)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chen Hai：</span><br>
Oh, hello, Commander. I didn't see you there.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Huan Ch'ang：</span><br>
You've caught us in the middle of something.<br>
I assure you that Fei Yuen will not be allowed near the canteen or the storeroom for a month hereafter.<br>
For now, we're going to leave her like this until she acknowledges her wrongdoings and...<br>
...What are you snacking on?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fei Yuen：</span><br>
Um, dried fruit? It's sweet and yummy.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hu Pen：</span><br>
Hey! Those are Lung Wu's!<br>
And I was supposed to stand guard to make sure nobody snuck a bite out of them!<br>
Oh nooo! She was already mad, but now she's really gonna blow a gasket!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fei Yuen：</span><br>
It's really, really good. You should all taste one!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hu Pen：</span><br>
Ugh! You're not at all sorry for what you've done!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fei Yuen：</span><br>
Because I haven't done anything wrong!<br>
You all say you have evidence, but none of you actually saw me put anything in the teapot, did you?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Huan Ch'ang：</span><br>
Well... No.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fei Yuen：</span><br>
Exactly! Just because you saw me holding a teapot doesn't mean I put anything in it!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Huan Ch'ang：</span><br>
That doesn't clear you of suspicion, though. You're staying right where you are.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fei Yuen：</span><br>
Commandeeer! Help Lady Yuen dooown! They're punishing me for something I didn't dooo!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
......<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fei Yuen：</span><br>
Come ooon! Help meee!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
......<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：You're on your own.</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fei Yuen：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Pleeease! I promise I won't go anywhere near the kitchen and the storeroom for a month! Just let me dooown!<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Get me dooown... Waaahhh...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''(She knows how to pull on my heartstrings...)<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：Okay, I'll help.</span>'''''<br>
<br>
It's too much to bear. I cave in and decide to let her down anyway.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fei Yuen：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Yay! I love you, Commander!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Huan Ch'ang：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''*sigh*... If you insist, then I'll let her off the hook just this once.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''But you have to promise you'll not go into the kitchen or the storeroom for a month.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fei Yuen：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Okay, I won't! Lady Yuen is a woman of her word!<br>

The Queen of Adventure<br>
<br>
3 The Real Culprit<br>
After relieving Fei Yuen of her punishment, I return to my office to finish off the last thing on my task list.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
I've made new tea for you, Commander. There's no weird flavorings added this time.<br>
Right, Fei Yuen?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fei Yuen：</span><br>
Eep! Y-you're scaring me, Memphis!<br>
You need to eat something to calm down... Like some dried apple slices!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Dried apple slices?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fei Yuen：</span><br>
Yeah! I snuck a few out from the kitchen! I wasn't gonna leave emptyhanded after what they did to me.<br>
I took a few for the Commander, too, of course!<br>
<br>
*knock knock*<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chen Hai：</span><br>
Commander, do you have a moment?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Sure. Come in.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chen Hai：</span><br>
Thank you. It's about the tea prank again.<br>
We just caught the real perpetrator.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
*looks around all guilty-like*<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">An Shan：</span><br>
I'm so, so sorry for what she did! This is unacceptable!<br>
Come on, you too! Say you're sorry!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
I'm sorryyy...<br>
But you have to admit, it was a pretty good prank, right? It DID get all of you! Ahahahah!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">An Shan：</span><br>
Fuuu Shuuun!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Owww! My cheek! Stop! Ow, ow! Stop pulling on iiit!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chen Hai：</span><br>
...We should also apologize to Fei Yuen.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hu Pen：</span><br>
Sorry, Yuen. You really were innocent all along.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
So it wasn't her, but Fu Shun who did it?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Huan Ch'ang：</span><br>
Yup. All of us, me included, simply jumped to the conclusion that it was Yuen.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fei Yuen：</span><br>
Ugh... I told you so! I told you I didn't do anything!<br>
Lucky for you, Lady Yuen is a lenient grownup. I'll accept these dried apple slices as an apology.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I'm glad that the misunderstanding was cleared up. How about we celebrate with a little teatime?<br>
I'm almost done with my work, so let's head to the dorm in a minute.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Huan Ch'ang：</span><br>
That sounds great, but can we be sure the tea hasn't been tampered with?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Don't worry, it hasn't. It's made with teabags from the office. Fu Shun hasn't touched it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Yeah, let's have tea! All that apologizing to An Shan has left me parched.<br>
<br>
Memphis brings out cups for everyone and tops them all up with tea. We all take a sip...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Everyone：</span><br>
*cough*! *cough*! *cough*!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
What is this?! It tastes like guaiwei AGAIN!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
How?! I brewed it just a minute ago!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fei Yuen：</span><br>
Ahahahah! Got you!<br>
Where Fu Shun failed, my great adventure succeeded!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
No... You used me as a scapegoat!<br>
That's so low! How could this happen?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fei Yuen：</span><br>
Ahah! Even you fell for my trick, my rival! This proves beyond a doubt that Lady Yuen is the best, the most daring adventurer at the port!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chen Hai：</span><br>
*cough* *cough*... So this was a two-pronged attack all along!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
No! I wasn't in on this! She did it without my knowing!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fei Yuen：</span><br>
THIS was the ace up my sleeve, Commander!<br>
What do you think, huh? Aren't you impressed?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">An Shan：</span><br>
Feeei Yueeen!<br>
<br>
It's the next day. A teapot sits on the table, free of any strange flavorings, next to two written apologies.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
"I'll get you next time! - Fu Shun." "The crown of the best adventurer belongs to me. - Fei Yuen."<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：They'll have to write better than this!</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：Good enough, I suppose.</span>'''''<br>
<br>
The End...?<br>
