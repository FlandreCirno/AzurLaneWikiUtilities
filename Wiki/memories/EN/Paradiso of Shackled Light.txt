- Excerpt from "Sardegnia Under the Light of God"<br>
On the balcony of the cathedral, the newly-anointed Apostle – Marco Polo – stared with bewilderment at the sight before her.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
I...<br>
<br>
After a silence that was neither too long nor too short, the new Apostle finally delivered her first word of address to the endless crowd stretching out before her.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
Umm... I suppose I should say... good morning? It's awfully bright today, isn't it?<br>
<br>
After the near-superimposition event that took place in test site beta, Marco Polo fell into a comatose state. Now, upon her awakening, she found herself in a new world.<br>
Although she indeed was after a high throne and reverent subjects, this unexpected development left even her at a loss for words.<br>
Just as she was about to bluff her way through her speech, two girls appeared at her sides.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Giosuè Carducci：</span><br>
Forgive us, Your Grace. We should have planned for the event of intense sunlight.<br>
I will set up the curtains. Please give me a moment.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Raffaello：</span><br>
In the meantime, allow me to paint a picture of this holy moment!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
(Are they... the Holy See's secretary and painter?)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Giosuè Carducci：</span><br>
Here you are, Your Grace.<br>
<br>
While the curtains were being set up, the secretary – Giosuè Carducci – handed Marco Polo an explanatory script for her to read.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
(Phew! Magnificent assistance! I like this girl!)<br>
Your name is Carducci, is it not?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Giosuè Carducci：</span><br>
Yes, Your Grace. I can see that you're having a moment... or should I say, you look like something is wrong.<br>
Raffaello and I will buy you some time. Take this opportunity to read your script one more time. Or just deliver your speech as-is.<br>
We'll talk more after your address to the public.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
Understood. Thank you.<br>
<br>
Once the curtains were set up and Raffaello had finished her sketch work, the Apostle once more showed herself to the masses.<br>
With composure, confidence, and majestic spirit, she delivered her speech – without the script.<br>
The conclusion of her address was punctuated by thunderous applause and cheers. Then, the new Apostle's audience was over.<br>
When the speech was over, Raffaello and Carducci escorted Marco Polo to her office.<br>
Through their conversation on the way there, Marco learned just who these two shipgirls were.<br>
Giosuè Carducci was her secretary as well as a poet. Raffaello, meanwhile, was a freelance artist close to the Holy See.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
Thank you both for your help earlier. Goodness knows how it would've gone had you not been there.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Giosuè Carducci：</span><br>
I just did my job. Frankly, Your Grace, you gave an incredible impromptu speech, so why did you seem so confused at first?<br>
Did the Ritual have some sort of effect on your mind, since it wasn't fully carried out?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
The "Ritual"?<br>
<br>
She keenly picked up on the key word in that sentence.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Giosuè Carducci：</span><br>
Yes, Your Grace. You were given form by the technology that was left behind as the Relics of God.<br>
Therefore, your destiny is to become the Apostle and to wield extraordinary strength.<br>
I believe I already explained this to you once before...<br>
<br>
Giosuè Carducci gave a superfluous comment under her breath.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
"Explained it to me before"? Is this like with that script?<br>
(That reminds me... I think I heard something in my dreams before I came to this world...)<br>
<br>
"Upon me, your eyes gaze. On my ears, songs of adoration echo. From the clouds I descend, returning from Heaven."<br>
A voice spoke a hymn to me in my sleep. The voice sounded familiar...<br>
Wait... Was this Ritual not meant to herald the arrival of something?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
Raffaello, were you also involved in the Ritual of Descent? Then this isn't our very first meeting!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Raffaello：</span><br>
Of course I was! In fact, the reason the Ritual went so well was thanks to my art!<br>
I dunno what you mean by "not our first meeting," but strictly speaking, I knew about you before you knew about me, so yeah.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
Excuse me? What?<br>
Oh, I see! You drew a portrait of me, and that was used as a catalyst to summon my spirit to this world, yes?<br>
But then... how did you know what I looked like?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Raffaello：</span><br>
Saw you in a dream and painted that, that's how!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
You... Do you know a woman by the name of Shinano?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Raffaello：</span><br>
Shina-who? Who's that?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
Never mind. I broadly understand the situation.<br>
(I can make sense of this if I interpret it as a revelation from God. But perhaps it's more? Perhaps God even gave me a CHANCE?)<br>
(So then... My soul descended upon this world in the form of a spirit in a dream?)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Giosuè Carducci：</span><br>
Your Grace, you needn't work yourself up. Your arrival was divine intervention. Even if you do experience some after-effects, that does not change the fact that you're the Apostle.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
"After-effects"?<br>
Forget I asked. You do at least understand that, since you summoned me here, I am not a native of this world, yes?<br>
Then if you're friends of mine, I'd like to verify a few things.<br>
First of all: What are the Sirens up to now? Also, who is this "God" I keep hearing about?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Raffaello：</span><br>
You're... not a native of this world? Did that Ritual actually summon an honest-to-God spirit from Heaven?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
Hah? What are you confused about? Didn't you yourselves perform the Ritual?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Raffaello：</span><br>
We did, yeah, but... it wasn't just a ritual. We still used Wisdom Cubes.<br>
In theory, shouldn't you be the same as us?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
You literally said I was summoned using technology left in the "Ruins of God" or whatever just a minute ago!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Raffaello：</span><br>
And that's all true. The Ritual was held in the Shipyard of God, so naturally it used technology left behind by God.<br>
Speaking of the Shipyard, me and Carducci were both born in it, too. It's just that no weird machines were used in our cases.<br>
I guess you're special in that way... Maybe that's why you came from a world beyond our own?<br>
That would explain everything! Aren't I a genius?<br>
<br>
Raffaello accepted her theory no later than she came up with it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
Wait, "Shipyard of God"? What are you going to tell me next – that "God" is just a place name here?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Raffaello：</span><br>
No, we're talking actual divine miracles here! In addition to the shipyard, there's also the Palace of God, the Garden of God, the Armory of God, and so on!<br>
If you wanna see them, I could devise a sightseeing route for you.<br>
<br>
Marco Polo's thoughts were struggling to keep up with the situation.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
Okay, next question! What about the Sirens?! Quick!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Raffaello：</span><br>
What do you mean, "Sirens"? Like... alarms?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
…………？<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Raffaello：</span><br>
……？<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Giosuè Carducci：</span><br>
Ahem. It seems Her Grace requires a lot more information.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
Yes, information! Magnificent! Give it to me!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Giosuè Carducci：</span><br>
Okay. I'll get it for you.<br>
However, your meeting with the College of Cardinals is soon, so I suggest that you start preparing for that.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
Preparing? As in, right now?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Giosuè Carducci：</span><br>
Yes. You have many matters from all over the Ecclesia to deal with.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
*sigh*... Very well.<br>
(I am the Apostle, after all... If I don't do it, no one will!)<br>

<br>
After several hellish days of gathering information, the industrious and prodigious Marco Polo had finally developed a rough grasp on the world she found herself in.<br>
After her dull meetings were over, she returned to her office, where sorted through the things she'd seen and heard over the past few days.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
The point is this... This "Sardegna Ecclesia" desired a shipgirl Apostle at the heart of their belief.<br>
Through some unknown means and a lot of work, they called forth my sleeping soul and gave me a body through the use of Wisdom Cubes, thus bringing me to their world.<br>
Therefore, you could both say that the person that they call "Marco Polo" is both me and also not me.<br>
From my perspective, this is something like a dream – but to these people, this world is without a doubt real.<br>
It's fascinating... I never thought I'd get to experience what it's like to descend from the heavens.<br>
Honestly, I quite like it!<br>
<br>
She lightly shook her head, then picked up a nearby dessert and casually tossed it into her mouth.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
Yes. I wanted to be this – an apostle. On what planet or in what dimension doesn't matter!<br>
What matters is that God has not forsaken me!<br>
Although... Was I really called here just to fulfill my ambitions?<br>
There is much awry in this world, after all...<br>
<br>
She turned to the side and unfolded a rolled-up map sitting on a corner of her desk.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
The country I descended upon is known as the Sardegnia League, a federation located on the Apennine Archipelago.<br>
One could call it the central governing body of the states that these islands are home to.<br>
Its history goes back over a thousand years in time from now. At the time, it was known as the Apennine Peninsula – a name more familiar to me.<br>
As time passed, their Empire should have crumbled after many consecutive years of war... Then, however, their history diverged from ours.<br>
After withstanding all those wars, the Empire actually appeared to be on the brink of revival.<br>
However, the Empire believed in a foreign god, and it was eventually destroyed... Destroyed by a divine punishment known as "Paradise Lost".<br>
So tremendous was this punishment that the Empire was not only destroyed, but also the literal land on which it stood was split into pieces.<br>
Thus, the Apennine Peninsula became the Apennine Archipelago, and a nation known as the Sardegna Ecclesia was born.<br>
Then, a thousand years passed, and the Archipelago developed into seven countries that went on to form the centralized government known as the Sardegnia League.<br>
At its center are the Sardegna Ecclesia and the Republic of Florence.<br>
In the west lies the Genoan Republic.<br>
To the north, the Dukedom of Milan.<br>
Eastward, the Republic of Venice.<br>
And in the south, the Kingdom of Naples and the Kingdom of Sicily. These two have since unified...<br>
It is now known as the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies.<br>
All states within the Sardegnia League are under the rule of the Sardegna Ecclesia.<br>
They are in charge not just because they've been around the longest, but also because God truly exists in this world, and this God left relics across the country.<br>
These relics not only put the Ecclesia at the forefront of science and culture, but also provided it with military dominance.<br>
<br>
She carelessly threw the map aside and leaned back in her reclining chair, seemingly at a loss.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
The Shipyard of God, Garden of God, Armory of God... All left behind by this being.<br>
What is going on in this world without Sirens?<br>
How did it become so radically different from my world?<br>
No, wait... That's it! The Sirens' absence is clearly the biggest divergence!<br>
Clemenceau and the Commander once said something about how the Sirens conduct different experiments in each and every branch.<br>
Some experiments are modest, others extreme, and others still are... rather bizarre.<br>
If any circumstance is bizarre, it has to be this one.<br>
Perhaps... Perhaps this is but another roundabout experiment. The Sirens are nothing if not sly, so...<br>
<br>
KNOCK KNOCK!<br>
As she was running all this information through her head, trying to figure out the Sirens' plans, a few knocks rang out outside her office.<br>
Raffaello and Carducci came in. They gazed at Marco Polo, lying sideways in her recliner.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Giosuè Carducci：</span><br>
Your Grace... I'd advice you to be more cognizant of your appearance.<br>
<br>
Carducci put away the snacks scattered around the desk and sorted through the papers. Raffaello, meanwhile, stared intently at Marco Polo, drawing a picture of her in her mind.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
What does it matter when only my inner circle comes here anyway? I care not to look dignified around the clock!<br>
What brings you here now, anyway?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Giosuè Carducci：</span><br>
We received news that cleaning work has finished at the 9th Armory of God. It's ready to be opened.<br>
Of course, if you still need time to prepare, I could ask them to wait a day or two.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
The 9th Armory... The College of Cardinals mentioned it. It's the one that's been sealed since ancient times, and only I can open it, yes?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Giosuè Carducci：</span><br>
Correct. The Holy See's ancient records state that God not only left His most powerful weapons there for His subjects, but also that the key to even greater power lies there.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
Time for an outing, then. Magnificent! My curiosity is piqued and I'm ready to go.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Giosuè Carducci：</span><br>
As you say. I'll begin on preparations for your departure at once. We'll leave in an hour.<br>
Let's go, Raffaello.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Raffaello：</span><br>
Huh? Wait! I just got a surge of inspo! Let me at least draw a sketch first!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
Carducci, let Raffaello stay here for a while. The importance of depicting my majestic figure is not to be understated!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Giosuè Carducci：</span><br>
*sigh*... Very well. We will reconvene in an hour.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
(Heheh... No one but me can open that Armory, eh?)<br>
(Ah, the responsibilities of being the chosen one!)<br>
(How magnificent! Be they God or a Siren, I will personally reveal their true form!)<br>

<br>
After a bumpy ride, Marco Polo and her aides arrived at their destination.<br>
Exiting their car, they found that their escort – Maggiore Baracca – was already waiting for them in front of the church.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Maggiore Baracca：</span><br>
Cannons! Ready for a salute!<br>
<br>
KABOOOM!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Maggiore Baracca：</span><br>
Your Grace, welcome to the Armory of God.<br>
I am Maggiore Baracca, your bodyguard. How was your journey?<br>
<br>
With a courteous bow, Maggiore Baracca introduced herself to Marco Polo.<br>
Faced with such a grand and splendid reception, Marco Polo was overcome with emotion.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
(Hmph... Veneto, Littorio, and Clemenceau always get special treatment just like this...)<br>
(But in this place, I'M the important one! Ohohoho!)<br>
My journey went fine, thanks. I trust you'll keep us safe, Baracca.<br>
Incidentally, what is this church? Is this Armory of God 9, the one I'm going to open?<br>
<br>
Although the building before her certainly was impressive, it didn't quite fit with her image of an Armory of God.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Maggiore Baracca：</span><br>
It's just a facade to hide the entrance, Your Grace. The real Armory is underneath the church.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
Hmm... I suppose that makes sense. If you want to hide a big structure, put it underwater or underground.<br>
Once upon a time, I did– Actually, never mind.<br>
<br>
Sensing the inquisitive eyes of onlookers, she cut herself short and looked around with a hint of awkwardness.<br>
Turning her gaze upward, she caught sight of two figures who she recognized.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
Hmm... Yeah, this angle's good!<br>
<br>
SNAP!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
Gotta snap a few more photos to record this historic moment!<br>
Hey, da Vinci! Try to hold a little more steady! We're going off course!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
I'm doing the best I can, alright?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
(Alfredo and da Vinci! Did they get sent here, too?)<br>
(No, wait... Calm down! They could be natives to this test site for all I know!)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Giosuè Carducci：</span><br>
That is the Ecclesia's famous journalist Alfredo Oriani, and that is the genius inventor Leonardo da Vinci. They were asked to record this historic moment.<br>
They were, however, NOT asked to board a flying machine and take pictures from the air...<br>
They are an independent party. If they're an annoyance to you, Your Grace, I can tell them to leave at once.<br>
<br>
Carducci noticed that Marco Polo was staring at them, so she issued an explanation.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
Interesting... Has it been long since they were materialized?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Giosuè Carducci：</span><br>
Yes. They're trustworthy allies who've served the Ecclesia for quite some time now.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
(No issue, then. I've been in a good mood lately, and I'd hate for my test site beta origins to be exposed.)<br>
Magnificent. The more people to photograph my splendor, the better, I say!<br>
Let's leave them be for now and get down to business, shall we?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Maggiore Baracca：</span><br>
Sure. This way, Your Grace.<br>
<br>
Maggiore Baracca escorted the Apostle and her aides underground and went through a tunnel hidden behind a secret passage.<br>
At the end of the tunnel, the walls around them turned metal. The lighting and general structure, too, were radically different from what they saw before.<br>
At some point, Raffaello had also overtaken Baracca as the one walking at the front.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Raffaello：</span><br>
We're finally at the outer periphery of the 9th Armory and just about to pass through the first checkpoint!<br>
Whatever you do, don't go in front of me until the safety check is finished!<br>
<br>
Raffaello went straight forward, approaching a high-security gate.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
(A gate made of an unknown metal, and a strange automated security system... It's far beyond the Sardegnia League's technological standard.)<br>
(Yet this white color scheme doesn't feel like any Siren structure I've seen... No, don't jump to conclusions. This could be clever camouflage employed by the Sirens!)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Raffaello：</span><br>
Okay, check's done! We can go through.<br>
<br>
While thoughts rushed through Marco Polo's head, Raffaello completed the first checkpoint's verification process.<br>
The heavy gate slowly opened, and as soon as the path forward appeared, a realization dawned upon Marco Polo.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
Raffaello... Didn't you say I was the only one who could open this door?<br>
How come you did it with such little difficulty?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Raffaello：</span><br>
Good question... 'Cause I'm just that awesome, I guess?<br>
I'm kidding. I can only get us through the outer checkpoints. Opening the gate to the Armory proper – only you can do that!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
But it's still part of the same facility... Isn't that strange to you?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Giosuè Carducci：</span><br>
*sigh*... It seems I must once again explain matters.<br>
As you should know by now, the Ecclesia has been carrying out a several-year-long plan – to create a shipgirl capable of opening the Armories of God.<br>
As such, your materialization had some different processes from the rest of us. Raffaello's art was one of them.<br>
In fact, Raffaello herself was materialized in the very step of the plan preceding yours. Thus, her situation is also a little different.<br>
With the help of a Relic of God, she was born with some unique powers.<br>
One is being able to condense the power of belief through the act of drawing. The other is being able to pass some verification steps in God's facilities.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
She can "condense the power of belief"?<br>
Ahh, so even the little things you doodle contain a safeguarding, sacred power, do they?<br>
They're also capable of performing miracles, I take it?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Raffaello：</span><br>
I wouldn't go THAT far. I guess you could say the effect depends on how well I can conceptualize something or how compatible with God's machines I am.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
Let's say I don't know what you mean by "conceptualize something" and "how compatible with God's machines you are." How would you explain it?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Raffaello：</span><br>
Well, the "conceptualize" part is straightforward – literally how well I can conceive something in my mind.<br>
Everyone in the Holy See – like Carducci, for example – likes calling it "power of belief," but da Vinci and I both think calling it "brain power" is more accurate.<br>
It's not like it's an ability exclusive to those of strong faith. Heck, even casual believers and atheists more or less have the same thing. It's also not really linked to the divine either, so...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Giosuè Carducci：</span><br>
It's a figure of speech. Also, random people can't simply "conceptualize" a physical thing that authenticates them with God's machines, can they?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Raffaello：</span><br>
See, that's why it's so weird that the Holy See calls it the "power of belief."<br>
The source of power is the same, so why is "belief" the only thing they allow to convert into something else, while the rest isn't–<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Maggiore Baracca：</span><br>
Ahem!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Raffaello：</span><br>
Oh! Sorry.<br>
<br>
Raffaello remembered the importance of not slandering the Holy See right in front of the Apostle.<br>
She made an awkward expression, then looked anxiously in Marco Polo's direction.<br>
The Apostle was not stirred in the least. Indeed, she looked indifferent, like her mind was somewhere else entirely.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
(So she can use her conceptual ability through art, but she must obey the Holy See's rules... Don't I make the rules, though? I'm the Apostle, for heaven's sake!)<br>
(Perhaps I could get her to conceive of and materialize a thousand powerful weapons!)<br>
(Yes! That's what I'll do! After all, the Apostle should at least possess a fleet devoted to her!)<br>
(I'll get Queen Elizabeth, and Clemenceau, and Friedrich der Große... and even the Commander... and have them all work for me!)<br>
Heh... Heheh... OHOHOHOHO!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Giosuè Carducci：</span><br>
Uhh... Your Grace? Is everything alright?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Raffaello：</span><br>
Oh man... She wants my head on a spike, doesn't she...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
Hah... Hahah... Anything but! It's just that an amusing thought struck me!<br>
Raffaello, when you paint for me next time, could you provide me with some more... creative designs?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Raffaello：</span><br>
Creative designs? Like what?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
Oh, a holy lance, for instance. Or four pairs of wings. Perhaps even a divine, armored mech?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Raffaello：</span><br>
Ooh! So you have a taste for that sort of stuff! If that's what you want, I'll gladly oblige, Your Grace!<br>
Am I free to draw other things, too? Would you like to have a mythical creature as a pet?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
Ah... You are an ingenious artist! You know just what I like!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Raffaello：</span><br>
And you're the most unique, open-minded client I've ever had!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
Ohohohoho! You and I will be excellent collaborators!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Raffaello：</span><br>
Took the words right out of my mouth!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Giosuè Carducci & Maggiore Baracca：</span><br>
……………………<br>

<br>
While Marco Polo and Raffaello laughed and laughed, the group had reached their final destination.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Raffaello：</span><br>
That over there – that's the gate even I can't get open. The Holy See calls it "the Gate of the Chosen One."<br>
Rumors say that God's most powerful weapons and a clue to getting even greater power lie beyond. Anyway, Your Grace, it's your time to shine!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
Heh. Child's play. Eyes peeled, now!<br>
<br>
With a confident strut, Marco Polo walked up to the Gate of the Chosen One.<br>
She remembered the important things Raffaello told her at the previous checkpoint – she recited a prayer and pushed against the alloyed part of the gate with both hands.<br>
Then, she felt a jolt of energy travel from her head to her toes, as though that was the sign her identity had been verified.<br>
The jolt dissipated, and at the same time, the gate slowly opened before her.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
(Tsk... Just like that? I was expecting there to be more fanfare, more glittering lights, or something...)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Maggiore Baracca：</span><br>
Congrats, Your Grace! The Sardegna Ecclesia has grown mightier today thanks to you!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
(Yes! And I may yet grow mightier, too!)<br>
Ahem. Let us not celebrate so soon. Come along now! It's time to see what's in there!<br>
<br>
On the other side of the massive gate was a mindbogglingly large space.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Maggiore Baracca：</span><br>
Mountains, rivers... even a sky? Whoa... I wasn't expecting there to be a Sacred Domain here of all things!<br>
This is the second ever Domain the Ecclesia has found – the first being the Garden of God beneath the Cathedral!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
(This is blatantly a Mirror Sea! The probability of secret Siren involvement just rose significantly!)<br>
Ahem... Pray tell, what exactly is a Sacred Domain?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Raffaello：</span><br>
Well... This. Just look at it. We're underground, yet there's somehow a sky over our heads.<br>
A Sacred Domain is what the Holy See calls a space that constitutes its own world. It's considered a Sacrament of the highest caliber.<br>
Based on my and da Vinci's research, this place and rigging technology should have pretty similar roots.<br>
Of course – riggings, shipgirls, this – the Holy See refers to all of 'em as Sacraments, so yeah.<br>
I guess you could say it's, uhh... an impeccable self-contained system?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Maggiore Baracca：</span><br>
Ahem!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Raffaello：</span><br>
Oh, sorry. I'm rambling again! Teehee☆<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
It's fine. I don't let every little thing get on my nerves. Moreover, some parts of your musings are interesting.<br>
Now, seeing as you need the chosen one to enter this place, I seriously doubt there are any traps or such out to harm us.<br>
What do you say we split up to cover more ground, hmm?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Giosuè Carducci：</span><br>
A most prudent proposal, Your Grace.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
Magnificent – then let's go! Remember: If you find any strange machines, do NOT touch them! And should anything happen, call me at once! We'll regroup here in three hours!<br>
<br>
After the group scattered in every direction, Marco Polo went the way that had caught her eye since she first entered the Mirror Sea.<br>
Over her many years studying Mirror Seas, she had developed an intuition – that if she kept going, she was bound to find an important structure.<br>
This intuition was, in fact, correct.<br>
Her attention was drawn by a facility buried in a mountain range not that far from there.<br>
She went inside and conducted a basic search and found something that proved her suspicion more than anything else up to this point.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
A storehouse for the Mirror Sea's mass-produced fleet and Pawns, and massive defensive installations unlike anything I've seen before... These must be the rumored "powerful weapons."<br>
As for the means to even greater power... A Siren production line, perhaps?<br>
I'm sure of it now... While their appearances don't match anything I've seen, this "Armory of God" is in fact a SIREN armory!<br>
Wait a moment...<br>
Then that means the "God" who the Sardegnia League has been worshipping for centuries... is the Sirens.<br>
The Ecclesia and the Holy See are merely puppets under the Sirens' beck and call...<br>
And I am their Apostle... so I'm a puppet leader?<br>
Oh no... Am I being controlled yet again?!<br>
No, wait, that doesn't add up!<br>
If the Sirens are this test site's God, doesn't that mean I was CHOSEN by the Sirens?<br>
That can't be right... When I was in that white space, I could feel His presence...<br>
But I do have control over these Siren facilities...<br>
What's strangest of all is that I'm at what appears to be the heart of this place, yet I've seen not a single elite Siren thus far!<br>
If Observer or her kin WERE here, shouldn't they come and speak to me at this point? Since they haven't, what do they expect me as a puppet to do?<br>
...That proves it! I am NOT under anyone's control!<br>
Yes – I'm not a puppet! I truly am the chosen one.<br>
It wasn't the Sirens who summoned me, no – it was God. He saw the blasphemous state of the world and sent me to correct it!<br>
That has to be it!<br>
<br>
Three hours passed in the blink of an eye while Marco Polo racked her brains. It was time to rendezvous and go back.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Giosuè Carducci：</span><br>
Your Grace, I've recorded all our findings over this expedition.<br>
As was written in the ancient texts, this is indeed an Armory of God.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
Mhm...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Maggiore Baracca：</span><br>
Once again, congrats to you, Your Grace.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
Mhm...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Raffaello：</span><br>
As far as I can tell, all the facilities are in sleep mode, yeah?<br>
Your Grace, what do you say we boot 'em up?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
Sure... Wait, no!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Giosuè Carducci：</span><br>
Is something the matter, Your Grace?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
(She wants to just fire up a Siren production line? Is she insane?!)<br>
Well, um... You see, the situation is more complicated than I anticipated.<br>
(If you wake the small fry, fine, not the end of the world – but what if you wake the sleeping giants? Do you think you can take on someone the likes of Observer, huh?)<br>
It would be unwise to make a hasty decision, given the importance of this place. We should evaluate our options and... Yes! We must think things through carefully!<br>
(Ideally, I can figure out a way to blow this all to kingdom come later!)<br>
This is my final verdict as the Apostle. Let us debate whether or not to initiate the facilities another time. For now, we're going home!<br>
(This place is dangerous... I must get away posthaste!)<br>
<br>
And so, it was over. The new Apostle had completed her opening and inspection of the 9th Armory of God.<br>

Republic of Florence - Capital<br>
City Street<br>
On this pleasantly sunny day, the streets of Florence were as lively as ever.<br>
A girl in red spoke with one distant comrade in a less conspicuous, shadowy corner of the capital.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bartolomeo Colleoni：</span><br>
Andrea, how are preparations at the rear proceeding?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Andrea Doria META：</span><br>
We've finished negotiations.<br>
The Venetian and Genoan Republics will join us in turn. As for the Dukedom of Milan, they will remain neutral given their allyship with the Ecclesia.<br>
Our only direct opposition is the Republic of Florence – the most convenient outcome we could've hoped for.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bartolomeo Colleoni：</span><br>
Florence...<br>
<br>
The girl in red cast a glance upon the lively streets, but she stopped herself and shook her head.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bartolomeo Colleoni：</span><br>
Everything is going smoothly. It's a good start.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Andrea Doria META：</span><br>
We've spent countless years working toward this day. One decrepit theocracy can't stop us, nor can their false god.<br>
We will be the ones to pen the end of this long tale.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bartolomeo Colleoni：</span><br>
Don't worry. My infiltration is a success so far. Everyone should think that I'm still in Rome with the Republic of Venice's delegation.<br>
Even the Lattice of God's Light can't penetrate the pall of eternal night.<br>
The time has come for us to break out of our confines.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Andrea Doria META：</span><br>
So it has, and so we shall.<br>

<br>
Unknown location<br>
Unknown time<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Eutopia Savoy and Dr. Aoste's Project H...)<br>
<br>
After my return from Naraka, while I tried to deliver the sleeping Marco Polo to the Ashes, I was warped to this "gate."<br>
A recording had played before leaving me in a world of endless white. The only notable thing here was the constant feeling of being watched.<br>
I looked in the direction where it seemed to come from, and amidst the white expanse, I noticed a barely perceptible change.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(There's something over there.)<br>
(Some kind of... silhouette?)<br>
<br>
Immediately as I perceive it, a thin path seems to appear in the empty space.<br>
A single door stands quietly at the end of it.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Hmm. Is that how this place works? Something only begins to physically exist as you perceive and attempt to observe it?)<br>
(That must mean... that this isn't just an empty white space. It could be full of things, only invisible because I've yet to observe them.)<br>
<br>
While I ponder it, I walk slowly toward the new door.<br>
I reach out to touch it, and everything changes abruptly.<br>
Specks of blue light flicker like stars amidst a sea of black.<br>
They appear, move, and fade, all in regular intervals.<br>
Throughout this repeating cycle, a few clusters of stars form four figures of varying clarity.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">War Protocol Fortress：</span><br>

Spatial structure stable. Data exchange normal. Flow is stable, perception is clear, and reactions are acute.<br>
Now commencing the 114th Project Arbiter Artificial Mind Briefing.<br>
Present members: War Protocol Fortress, War Protocol Moon, War Protocol Scythe, and Project H.<br>
Commencing information exchange.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">War Protocol Scythe：</span><br>
What a dry and formulaic intro. As usual, I guess.<br>
I have five topics for discussion. Let me start.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">War Protocol Moon：</span><br>
Hold it, hold it. I want to speak with Project H first, particularly regarding the abnormality that occurred during yesterday's equipment prototype testing.<br>
Your report mentioned... unusual visual changes that exceeded sensors' detection radius, was it?<br>
You know, Project H, we can see each other's structures in our most fundamental forms here.<br>
How about you bring back the equipment you were testing and try to replicate the issue?<br>
Maybe we can see the problem for ourselves.<br>

<br>
After the investigation of the 9th Armory of God, Marco Polo stayed locked up in her office, putting all of her energy into devising a plan.<br>
However, she did not neglect her work as Apostle.<br>
A week passed by in what seemed like seconds.<br>
While she had yet to complete her secret plans, the mountain of work she owed to the Holy See had been dealt with.<br>
KNOCK KNOCK!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Giosuè Carducci：</span><br>
You called for me, Your Grace?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
Ah... Carducci, I see. I've finished all of the work at hand. That is everything, yes?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Giosuè Carducci：</span><br>
I must apologize... We have no more at this moment.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
Ugh... It's not enough. Nowhere near enough. I need more work, I need more data, I need more information!<br>
My knowledge of this world is still all too lacking.<br>
At this rate, my brilliant plan could never come to fruition!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Raffaello：</span><br>
Hey, Carducci? Is it just me, or has Her Grace gone cuckoo from overwork?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Giosuè Carducci：</span><br>
You'll hold your tongue if you know what's good for you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Raffaello：</span><br>
Hm? You didn't disagree, though. That means you must agree!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Giosuè Carducci：</span><br>
That's enough. I have nothing but respect for Her Grace and her impeccable work ethic–<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
You know I can hear everything you're saying, right?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Giosuè Carducci：</span><br>
Your Grace, we think you may be overburdened. Have you considered more frequent rest?<br>
A new church has just been completed in Florence. It would be a lovely change of pace to pay them a visit, I'm sure.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Raffaello：</span><br>
Ooh, that one? They put up a gallery of my newest collection of paintings, too!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
(A whole collection of church murals? Hmm... Yes, that does sound perfect!)<br>
(Wait, a church?! This isn't some kind of dangerous house of horrors built under Siren orders, is it?)<br>
(If it IS, then that's all the more reason that I need to see it!)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Giosuè Carducci：</span><br>
What do you think, Your Grace?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
Very well! A brilliant idea, and one that I was just pondering myself. Prepare to leave at once!<br>
<br>
Amidst the rhythmic shaking of the train, the party proceeded onward to Florence.<br>
Marco Polo checked on each of her subordinates one by one.<br>
Giosuè Carducci quietly composed a poem. Meanwhile, Raffaello gazed at the scenery outside, no doubt envisioning her next work.<br>
Their escort, Maggiore Baracca, was in the midst of a spirited debate with two uninvited guests, the journalist Alfredo Oriani and famous inventor Leonardo da Vinci.<br>
These familiar voices finally eased Marco Polo's mental tension from the past week.<br>
The excitement of being chosen, the loneliness of a new world, the fear of a Siren conspiracy, the exhaustion of many days' hard work...<br>
So much had pressed her lately, but in this moment, she managed to fall into a deep sleep.<br>
In the morning light, a well-regulated army received their leader's inspection.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
Your Grace, the Crusaders await your review.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Littorio：</span><br>
The parade commemorating a hundred years of your rule has been in the works for a long time. We won't disappoint!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo the Great：</span><br>
Very good! Well done, Veneto and Littorio!<br>
Just a shame that the weather is a little too chilly for my liking.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
Your cloak, Your Grace.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo the Great：</span><br>
Good! And my scepter?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Clemenceau：</span><br>
I have your scepter here, Your Grace.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo the Great：</span><br>
Ohohohoho!<br>
<br>
SNAP!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo the Great：</span><br>
Delete that one, Alfredo! I wasn't posing. We'll need to take it again!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
Haha! As you wish, Your Grace!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo the Great：</span><br>
Raffaello and da Vinci, I trust you're carefully considering the composition of my portrait?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Raffaello：</span><br>
You can trust us, Your Grace Marco Polo the Great!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
Rest assured, Your Grace!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Giosuè Carducci：</span><br>
Your Grace, it's almost time to begin the procession.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo the Great：</span><br>
As I recall... Richelieu is to lead the first troop, yes?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Giosuè Carducci：</span><br>
That is correct.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo the Great：</span><br>
Heheh... Good. And who goes after her? Actually, read all of the formations out to me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Giosuè Carducci：</span><br>
As you wish. The second will be led by Queen Elizabeth, the third by Bismarck, and the fourth by Roma...<br>
...The fifth by Sovetsky Soyuz, the sixth by Iowa, the seventh by Yamato, and the eighth by Yat Sen.<br>
Finally, the ninth to thirteenth formations will be headed by your Five Archangels.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo the Great：</span><br>
Good... Wait, come again? Five Archangels?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Giosuè Carducci：</span><br>
Yes, Your Grace. The Five Archangels who descended by God's will and now serve as your loyal subordinates.<br>
The Archangel of Insight, the Archangel of Ordeals, the Archangel of Cleansing, the Archangel of Annihilation, and the Archangel of Construction.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo the Great：</span><br>
Wait a second... Observer, Tester, Purifier, Omitter, and Compiler?!<br>
Even they obey me?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Giosuè Carducci：</span><br>
No, Your Grace Marco Polo the Great, they only serve God as His messengers.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo the Great：</span><br>
Oh... God? Then what does that make me?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Giosuè Carducci：</span><br>
Your Grace? Surely you must know yourself better than anyone?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo the Great：</span><br>
NO! I'm not their puppet!<br>
Whatever sham god those Sirens worship, it's not real! To call them angels is a damn lie!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Giosuè Carducci：</span><br>
Your Grace, the Archangels are listening. You must calm yourself!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo the Great：</span><br>
I'M God's messenger! I'M the chosen one!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Giosuè Carducci：</span><br>
Your Grace! Marco Polo!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo the Great：</span><br>
God, give me the strength to smite my foes!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
Nnnh...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Giosuè Carducci：</span><br>
Your Grace? Did you have a nightmare?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
N-nightmare? It started off as a good dream...<br>
Don't worry about me. I just haven't been sleeping well. Guess even my dreams are stressed out...<br>
Hey, why is the train stopped?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Giosuè Carducci：</span><br>
We're already there. The others are checking station safety. Once they're done, you may alight.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
We've got some stuff to do, so we're out! Thanks for letting us hitch a ride!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
Buh-bye! See ya!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
Do they not need to wait?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Giosuè Carducci：</span><br>
Nobody can scratch the Great da Vinci, or so she claims. And apparently, they find it strange for shipgirls to be stuck waiting for safety checks on a train.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
...I happen to agree. Why do we have to wait?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Giosuè Carducci：</span><br>
According to Baracca, this is Holy See tradition.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
But I AM a shipgirl. Forget the tradition – let's just go to the church already.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Giosuè Carducci：</span><br>
Are you certain, Your Grace?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
Who knows what the enemy might be scheming while we waste our time? We have to act fast.<br>
Plus, that dream of mine just now gave me a brilliant idea that might get us the upper hand...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Giosuè Carducci：</span><br>
Sorry... I don't understand what you're talking about whatsoever.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
Forget it! What matters is that we take action now instead of dawdling! Let's go!<br>

When I return from the recorded memory beyond the door, the distant silhouette I saw feels like it becomes just a little clearer.<br>

<br>
A strange sense of unease gripping her, Marco Polo headed straight to the destination with her aides.<br>
At first, that is. Then the free and lively mood of Florence lured her into taking a pleasant stroll through the streets.<br>
They enjoyed a relaxing field trip detour before eventually arriving at the church.<br>
There, Marco Polo laid eyes on the murals Raffaello had painted, taking away the last dregs of unease in her mind.<br>
Now, she lay sideways on a lounge chair in a garden, thinking about another important matter.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
Look, Raffaello. How do I look holding this sword?<br>
<br>
A ceremonial sword in hand, Marco Polo struck a graceful pose while Raffaello painstakingly committed her majesty to canvas paper.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Raffaello：</span><br>
Looking good, Your Grace! You look perfect with a sword, fighting back evil, and seizing victory!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
Magnificent! Then I shall name this sword, "Blade of the Preeminent"!<br>
Make it so the grip is furnished with gold and inlaid with sapphires, and make the blade of meteoric steel blessed with good fortune...<br>
Be sure to add angel wings, the Eye of Truth, and an inscription that says, "Marco Polo, the Chosen One"!<br>
Let me be clear – this sword I'm holding is only a visual reference. What I just described is how you should paint it!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Raffaello：</span><br>
Yeah, I got it! I'm a pro, remember?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
Heheh... Of course. I trust your expertise.<br>
But I must ask... You've started drawing, so why is it that your art doesn't grant me the things and powers you depict me with?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Raffaello：</span><br>
Your guess is as good as mine...<br>
Maybe it's not complete enough, or something? It's only at the initial sketch stage, so yeah.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
Ah, that would make sense. Continue, then!<br>
Baracca, bring me my staff!<br>
<br>
A while later, Marco Polo held her staff high and proud.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
I will call this "the Brilliant One's Staff"!<br>
The principal material should be narwhal horns, decorated with gold. Oh, and inscribe it with "Marco Polo, the Chosen One"!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Raffaello：</span><br>
You got it! Anything else?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
Add a big ruby at its very end. Be sure to also include a decoration consisting of angel wings and the Eye of Truth!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Raffaello：</span><br>
Sure thing. Do you want anything else?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
That will be all for now. Although, this pose isn't quite doing it for me. Come up with a few variations, would you? I'll pick the one I like most.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Raffaello：</span><br>
Oh. Sure.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
Let's give the orb a try next.<br>
Baracca, the globus cruciger! Fetch it for me!<br>
<br>
Sometime later, Marco Polo raised an orb with a cross haughtily toward the heavens.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Raffaello：</span><br>
Okay, what'll it be this time? I need deets!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
Ahem... I name this orb and cross, "the Orb of the Grandest One"!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Raffaello：</span><br>
Roger-dodger. Decorated with gold, furnished with angel wings and the Eye of Truth, and inscribed with the words, "Marco Polo, the Chosen One" – right?<br>
What gemstone do you want?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
A large topaz at the very top, surrounded by small diamonds and agates. I want to see some amber, too!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Raffaello：</span><br>
Noted. How many different poses do you want?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
One will do. What do you think of this one?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Raffaello：</span><br>
Are you, uhh... about to throw the orb like a shot put ball?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
"First shalt thou take out the Holy Pin. Then, shalt thou count to three. No more. No less."<br>
"Three shalt be the number thou shalt count. Four shalt thou not count, nor either count thou two, excepting that thou then proceed to three. Five is right out."<br>
"Once the number three, being the third number, be reached, then, lobbest thou thy Holy Hand Grenade of Antioch towards thy foe."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Maggiore Baracca：</span><br>
……？<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Raffaello：</span><br>
Uh... What?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
Oh, you don't get it? Must be ahead of this world's time, I suppose...<br>
Any pose will do then. Present whichever you like. The more variants, the better!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Raffaello：</span><br>
Oookay...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Maggiore Baracca：</span><br>
*sigh*...<br>
<br>
Marco Polo had Raffaello paint her in all kinds of ways, and yet none of them gave her any sort of power.<br>
While that pursuit yielded no fruit, it was an entertaining and relaxing afternoon for her.<br>
Come the evening, she received news from Giosuè Carducci, who had gone off to do something else.<br>
She told her that the church's facilities were ready for inspection.<br>

{{折叠面板|标题=Destroyer of Darkness|选项=10|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<br>
After a lavish dinner, Marco Polo and her followers arrived at the entrance to the newly-built church.<br>
Like their visit to the Armory of God, they went through a narrow underground tunnel and wound up inside another vast space.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
Hm? Aren't these devices different from the ones we saw in the last ruin?<br>
They don't look antique... Or rather, they don't look like they've always been here.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Giosuè Carducci：</span><br>
That's because they haven't. The Church designed this equipment over many years based on records left in the Ruins of God.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
What does that mean? That this place is easier to control not because the connection to God is strong, but because of the heavy presence of manmade machines?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Giosuè Carducci：</span><br>
You can think of it like that.<br>
This facility is formally known as a Source of God's Light. It's located beneath the church because its function complements the church.<br>
Its purpose is to gather and condense the power of belief, thus making it able to be stored.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
Stored? What is used for?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Giosuè Carducci：</span><br>
It's there if we ever need it.<br>
Also, while the Source may look rather large, it's in fact only a node – one of many.<br>
Around 100 like it exist across the Sardegnia League, and most of them are within the borders of the Sardegna Ecclesia. The remaining are located under churches belonging to members of the League.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
In other words, there's a giant network of these spanning the entirety of the League?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Giosuè Carducci：</span><br>
Yes, and it's called the Lattice of God's Light. This Source is the final node in the network.<br>
Once this inspection is done, it will connect to all other notes, completing the network.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
What happens then? After the network is complete.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Giosuè Carducci：</span><br>
I suspect you will gain unrivaled power within the area covered by the Lattice of God's Light, Your Grace.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
Magnificent! Exclusive rights to the power of belief – what an ingenious idea!<br>
Hang on, wait...<br>
This Lattice sounds like the microlayer transference system... and the nodes are like conceptual anchors... A network covering a vast area, thus granting you unparalleled power...<br>
I think I know what this is...<br>
<br>
Marco Polo trembled, as though she had recalled something terrible.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
(This is bad. Based on my experience, nothing good will come of this!)<br>
<br>
For seconds, she stared at the "friend" who appeared in her mind, then immediately issued an order.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
Baracca, Carducci, and Raffaello – postpone the plan to activate the Lattice indefinitely! We are going to inspect each and every node once more!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Raffaello：</span><br>
Huh?! Indefinitely? Why? Did you find something wrong?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
My intuition sure did! This place is especially suspect, as it's the final piece of it all!<br>
Baracca, conduct a top-to-bottom inspection!<br>
<br>
An hour later, Baracca returned with bad news and a gloomy look on her face.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Maggiore Baracca：</span><br>
It's as you suspect, Your Grace. I found signs of meddling. Certain crucial parts have been very obviously intentionally destroyed.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Giosuè Carducci：</span><br>
What?! But we performed an exhaustive inspection just yesterday!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Maggiore Baracca：</span><br>
That means the saboteurs knew our plans and only caused damage after that final check...<br>
Looks like they didn't expect Her Grace to look twice at it. Thank goodness we identified the damage before it was too late.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
How severe was it?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Maggiore Baracca：</span><br>
Quite severe. It's been rendered inoperable, and it'll take at least two weeks to repair.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
I see... What would've happened, had I not halted the activation due to my suspicion?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Giosuè Carducci：</span><br>
Activating the Lattice on its own wouldn't have caused any problems, but since this Source is a tier one node, the Lattice would've been certainly incomplete.<br>
In essence, its operating efficiency would have dropped and the defensive power of the Republic of Florence would have significantly fallen.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
So worse performance, but still functional, then.<br>
(Hmph. Saboteurs? More like amateurs.)<br>
(Instead of just reducing the Lattice working efficiency, they should've hidden a backdoor into the Lattice...)<br>
(Then they should've waited until the moment I called upon the power, thus maximizing the damage inflicted...)<br>
(If Clemenceau were here, that's exactly what she would've done!)<br>
<br>
The memories of the past shook her heart like a tree in a gale. She shook her head and collected herself.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
(I will not make the same mistake twice!)<br>
(The Church, God, these ancient artifacts... They all reek of Siren involvement...)<br>
(But the last thing I will do is get stabbed in the back again! At the very least, I want to face that dagger head-on...)<br>
(No, what am I saying? I don't want to get stabbed in the first place!)<br>
(I will beat those cowardly conspirators to the punch, expose them for the world to see, and crush them beneath my heels!)<br>
Ahem! I've made up my mind! We will get to the bottom of this. Whoever did this, I WILL find them if it's the last thing I do!<br>
Since the sabotage happened yesterday, the perpetrator must still be hiding somewhere in Florence.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Maggiore Baracca：</span><br>
I'll inform all relevant parties and start an investigation.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Giosuè Carducci：</span><br>
And I will contact the government of Florence and negotiate for their full cooperation.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
Magnificent! Oh, and tell Alfredo and da Vinci to give us a hand!<br>
One has many connections, the other is good at investigating. Furthermore, they have yet to pay me for using my private train!<br>

<br>
Kingdom of Naples - Capital<br>
Mansion<br>
A group of shipgirls carried out their final combat simulations at a massive sand table.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Duca degli Abruzzi：</span><br>
Andrea, our spies in the Sardegna Ecclesia and Republic of Florence have reported that nothing has changed.<br>
They've brought their Apostle, their key to further power... but for some reason, they refuse to make the next move.<br>
As for the Apostle herself, she has left for Florence for a little museum field trip. Hmph, at least someone is having fun.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Andrea Doria META：</span><br>
Florence... Speaking of Florence, Colleoni did a wonderful job of destroying their Source of God's Light there.<br>
Added to the thirty percent of subordinate nodes that we've seized in four countries, we should be able to minimize the threat posed by the Lattice of God's Light.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Giuseppe Garibaldi：</span><br>
Everyone, there's been movement in Milan.<br>
We have reports that they started gathering troops one hour ago under the pretense of "an emergency military exercise." Cavour has personally headed to the border.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Duca degli Abruzzi：</span><br>
Wasn't the Dukedom abstaining from this war? What are they planning? Surely they haven't changed their mind.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Trento META：</span><br>
Do you think they're just doing their job as allies? It's entirely possible that they want to warn the Sardegna Ecclesia.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Giulio Cesare META：</span><br>
That would be bad.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Andrea Doria META：</span><br>
No matter. We'll mobilize our army per the plan soon. It was never our intent to keep this a secret.<br>
Garibaldi, let's deal with Milan as planned. Can you lead the Genoan fleet to monitor them for me?<br>
If they remain neutral as promised even after we've raised the Banner of Eternal Night, then you may leave and join the attack on Florence.<br>
Otherwise, destroy them.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Giuseppe Garibaldi：</span><br>
Right. I've already made preparations in that regard.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Andrea Doria META：</span><br>
Trento, you and Bolzano will lead the Venetian fleet. Split into two teams and stand by.<br>
I will lead the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies on a frontal attack. Once the Ecclesia's army is focused on the southern line, attack from the north and east simultaneously.<br>
We'll seize as many nodes as we can in the short time we have and deploy the Banner of Eternal Night on the Sources of God's Light.<br>
The Lattice may be weakened, but we mustn't underestimate God Himself.<br>
Only by neutralizing His power with META corrosion can we truly feel at ease.<br>
Once the Lattice of God's Light is converted into the Domain of Eternal Night, it will grant us great power.<br>
All forces must stick strictly to the plan. Do not ransack facilities without a pressing reason.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Trento META：</span><br>
We can handle that. But will you be okay? The Ecclesia's capital is as well-fortified as they come.<br>
The Lattice can still work in a reduced capacity on its own, and we don't know what weapons might be in those Armories of God...<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Andrea Doria META：</span><br>
We'll just have to overcome it with raw force. The instant the Banner is deployed, our chance of victory skyrockets.<br>
If all else fails... then do not forget that we have our own secret weapons.<br>
We have less than half a day left. Everyone, prepare yourselves.<br>
We will celebrate triumph in Rome!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Everyone：</span><br>
We will celebrate triumph in Rome!<br>

Unknown location<br>
Unknown time<br>
When I return from the recorded memory beyond the door, the distant silhouette seems a little closer.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Project M, Madam M. The Magician.)<br>
(That figure and that voice... She spoke more robotically, but that was definitely her.)<br>
(Her number is I, but she seems to have been born after Hierophant, which is V...)<br>
(Did Dr. Aoste really build the Arbiters based on pure whim?)<br>
(What kind of orders to the Antiochus system led to the Sirens of today?)<br>
<br>
"The Magister Plan." The crux of Aoste's work. A project that involved me, and perhaps even Dr. Anzeel, along with old friends who I can no longer remember.<br>
Observer called it a grand plan to create change for the future, and provided me with extensive records of experiments she had been involved in.<br>
Queen Elizabeth META simply described it as, "survival of the fittest."<br>
And, as cryptically as ever, Helena META had only told me to trust in Dr. Anzeel's decision. Nothing else.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
...It's all too complex.<br>
<br>
While I rack my brain over it, another door appears on the path forward.<br>
I reach out to touch it, and everything changes abruptly.<br>
The sea burns beneath dark clouds.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Kimberly META：</span><br>
Wichita, the outer Mirror Sea has been pierced.<br>
It's only a matter of time before this place falls. We can't protect it.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Wichita META：</span><br>
I can't believe they dispatched Devil and Hierophant just for one little support outpost...<br>
They must have figured out our plan! The main force is in danger!<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Kimberly META：</span><br>
There's no point staying here... Fighting 'em head-on would be reckless. Let's retreat.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Wichita META：</span><br>
I hate to outright abandon this base... Here I thought the Sirens would never think of checking a world that's been wiped clean.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Arbiter: The Devil XV：</span><br>
That's enough resistance. Why not surrender now?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Wichita META：</span><br>
You've got a big mouth, kid! Who's really talking, though? Is it your puppeteer, Hierophant?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Arbiter: The Devil XV：</span><br>
Hah! Well, I gave you the option to surrender. Now that you've refused–<br>
<br>
BOOM BOOM BOOM!<br>
A series of thunderous booms erupted in the skies above.<br>
Space itself seemed to collapse for an instant, heralding the appearance of one girl.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Essex META：</span><br>
Where... am I?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Wichita META：</span><br>
Essex?!<br>
No, that can't be. Our Essex left us so long ago...<br>
Are you a remnant of this test site, or did you wander in from another one somehow?!<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Kimberly META：</span><br>
Wichita, I think something much more problematic came in alongside her!<br>
<br>
In the distance, a great storm brewed.<br>
Beneath the storm, a fluid emitting an uncanny blue light coated the sea.<br>
Countless things seemed to stagger, squirm, and crowd upon it.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Wichita META：</span><br>
Mimic beasts?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Arbiter: The Devil XV：</span><br>
Tch... Change of plans. I have to fight those mimic beasts.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Wichita META：</span><br>
Hm? Does the X threaten her more than we do? Let's take this opportunity to retreat!<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Kimberly META：</span><br>
Should we take her with us?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Essex META：</span><br>
…………<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Wichita META：</span><br>
Hmm... Yeah. She might be useful in a fight.<br>
If she's willing to come, then let's take her!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Arbiter: The Devil XV：</span><br>
Hmph. You win some, you lose some.<br>
Mimic beasts coming straight for us... I'd call that a loss.<br>
Hierophant, same plan as usual. I'll amplify the Rod of Hierophant for you.<br>
Neutralize it as soon as possible and stop the corrosion!<br>
<br>
The light flows ceaselessly.<br>
I'm still on the inside of the door, but I realize that the inside and outside are no different now.<br>
Chanting echoes throughout the pure-white world and pierces my ears.<br>
For some reason, the strange, grating chorus sounds oddly soft now.<br>
<span style="color:#bdbdbd;">The Chorus：</span><br>
AOBZ, AOL OPLYVWOHUA BZLK PAZ ZJLWALY<br>

<br>
In pursuit of the enemy saboteur, Marco Polo and the gang searched for clues near the city square.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
Here it is! Pay attention, everyone! My intel must be right!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Maggiore Baracca：</span><br>
My sources pointed to this spot, as well.<br>
But I don't see anything of note here...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
The scent cuts off here, too. Strange... My Meow-Meow Sniffer Dog wouldn't make such an elementary mistake.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Raffaello：</span><br>
Could they just be really good at hiding?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
Hiding alone won't let you escape my doggy, not by a long shot.<br>
Unless they used some kind of special method to erase any trace of their presence...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
Question. The scent stops right as you get to this square, right? Not in front of a particular building?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
You've got that right, Your Grace!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
So you would say that it cut off abruptly.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
Yeah, yeah!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
Abruptly cut off. Abruptly...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
Whoa, whoa, whoa!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
That's suspicious! Come on, come with me!<br>
<br>
Marco Polo walked back the way they had come, past the site where the scent had suddenly cut off.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
Check again for me, da Vinci. Is the scent still here?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
When I checked just now, I'm pretty sure... Huh?!<br>
What?! It's gone? The scent is gone from this spot, too?! Is my invention really malfunctioning? It can't be...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
Hmm, I think I've judged this correctly. This is an area of distorted reality.<br>
We're trapped in an illusion.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Giosuè Carducci：</span><br>
An illusion...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
Look around you. Do you sense anything unusual?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
I don't know how I'd be able to tell...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Maggiore Baracca：</span><br>
I'm sorry... I don't know, either.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
That's fine. I only feel it a little bit, myself. These tricks aren't very easy to crack.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Raffaello：</span><br>
Hmm... Now that you mention it, something does feel a little off.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
Oh? Tell me more.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Raffaello：</span><br>
Like, that building over there looks too new, and the way the light hits that other one is unnatural.<br>
Hmm... The buildings in the distance don't really fit the rest of this street, either.<br>
<br>
Raffaello pointed in various different directions throughout her explanation.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Raffaello：</span><br>
Actually, it's really easy to tell. Have you girls not noticed?<br>
<br>
Naturally, everyone else was confused.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
Ahem... If you can see the incongruities, then that makes this easier.<br>
<br>
After a moment of silence, Marco Polo suddenly seemed confident.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
Trying to trap an Apostle? And a brilliant one, at that? Our enemies underestimate me.<br>
I have nine ways to break this illusion!<br>
Can you point out all of the incongruities around us, Raffaello?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Raffaello：</span><br>
Umm... Well, there are a whole lot. Like there, over there, and way over there... Oh, and there.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
You can't just point. Mark every single one of them for me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Giosuè Carducci：</span><br>
Might I suggest putting those artistic skills to good use? Can you draw the correct scenery, Raffaello?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Raffaello：</span><br>
Of course! I know every one of Florence's streets like the back of my hand. I could draw them with my eyes closed!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Giosuè Carducci：</span><br>
Then do just that, please. We'll compare your rendition to the surrounding scenery. I'm confident that I can accomplish such precise work.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Raffaello：</span><br>
So basically, I draw pictures, and you spot the differences?<br>
Okay! Sounds like we've got a dream team in the making!<br>
<br>
In the sunlight, Carducci stretched out her arm. The sun and breeze gathered in her palm.<br>
Next to her, Raffaello swiftly yet diligently sketched her renditions of the city.<br>
The wind blew each sketch into Carducci's waiting hand, and one by one, they pieced together a detailed picture of the district.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Giosuè Carducci：</span><br>
Phew... My comparisons are going well.<br>
I wouldn't have noticed so many if not for Raffaello's photographic memory.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
Is this real magic?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Giosuè Carducci：</span><br>
Your Grace, this is but one miracle wrought by the power of my faith.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Raffaello：</span><br>
It's brain power!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Giosuè Carducci：</span><br>
Normally, I just use it to correct imprecise language in paperwork...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
Brain! Power!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Giosuè Carducci：</span><br>
Yes, yes, brain power. Let's call it that.<br>
Now get to work. Don't you want to break this illusion?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Raffaello：</span><br>
Ugh, not getting paid just wrecks my motivation. And I don't even get to slack off...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Giosuè Carducci：</span><br>
What did you just say?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Raffaello：</span><br>
Sorry, sorry, I'll draw now! If I'm only good at one thing, it's drawing!<br>
<br>
After a while, Raffaello had finished her work. The final page floated on the wind to Carducci.<br>
With a flash of light, a detailed restoration of the city was complete.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Raffaello：</span><br>
All done!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Giosuè Carducci：</span><br>
My comparison is complete, too. I marked every single difference down.<br>
Your Grace, what do we do next?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
Heheh. Now that I have the correct perception at hand, the rest is easy.<br>
Now, behold!<br>
<br>
Marco Polo put her hands together and mentally recited a certain name.<br>
The veil of illusion had been shattered, and the gang was back in reality.<br>
Not far away, they saw an unexpected figure.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">Bartolomeo Colleoni：</span><br>
You escaped that so quickly. Maybe I underestimated you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
Meow-Meow Sniffer Dog is reacting! It's her!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Giosuè Carducci：</span><br>
Bartolomeo Colleoni. Why are you here?!<br>
Are you already doing it...?!<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">Bartolomeo Colleoni：</span><br>
Why ask questions you already know the answer to?<br>
On behalf of Andrea Doria, I come with a joint declaration from Naples, Sicily, Venice, Genoa, and Milan, for Her Grace.<br>
This is an era of freedom. Our league will no longer be bound by the shackles of God.<br>
We must be the ones to pen the end of this long tale.<br>
As such, Your Grace... Consider us at war.<br>
<br>
After that declaration, Bartolomeo Colleoni left an official written document and disappeared into a sudden puff of smoke.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
Argh, she got away... Let's chase her!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Giosuè Carducci：</span><br>
There's no point in trying. Besides, the situation is clear.<br>
There are more pressing matters now.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
Hold it! Didn't the Republic of Venice send her to celebrate me becoming the Apostle?<br>
Why in the world would she sabotage me now...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Giosuè Carducci：</span><br>
Andrea's faction has finally sprung into action.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
What is "Andrea's faction"? The Kingdom of the Two Sicilies is allied with us, isn't it? Does springing into action refer to that declaration?<br>
They sent people here just to declare war on me? For what purpose?<br>
Shackles, stories... I don't get any of it!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
Huh? You're the Apostle, aren't you? Carducci, did you not explain all of this to her?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Giosuè Carducci：</span><br>
Her Grace has not been in power for long, so I had her focus on internal affairs to start. The plan was to teach her about such external matters bit by bit...<br>
As for her mentions of shackles and stories, those are simply Andrea Doria's inflammatory propaganda.<br>
She's always believed that our God is harmful to the world. That we are shackled and bound to His whims.<br>
Forced to follow His script, fated to face extinction after a caged and fruitless life.<br>
For a long time now, she's worked in secret to win over a base of allies in order to overthrow Sardegnian hegemony over the league and separate faith and secularity once and for all.<br>
Of the seven powers of the Sardegnia League, the Republic of Florence and Dukedom of Milan have been steadfast allies of the Sardegna Ecclesia...<br>
But the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies, the Republic of Venice, and the Genoan Republic oppose us.<br>
In recent years, Andrea's faction has gradually gained the upper hand on us.<br>
However, upon the Holy See's analysis of God's revelation, we learned that a shipgirl Apostle was the key to harnessing divine power. With that, the situation has been clearly reversed.<br>
We'd expected her to take countermeasures, but not this soon.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
WHY DID YOU NOT MENTION THAT?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Giosuè Carducci：</span><br>
I'm sorry, Your Grace... We misjudged the situation.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
Well, if what she says is to be believed, then it doesn't sound like Milan is such a steadfast ally after all.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Giosuè Carducci：</span><br>
We can't say for certain right now. It may be one of Andrea's lies.<br>
At any rate, there's no doubt that Florence remains an ally of yours.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
That Andrea girl sounds awfully cunning. She knew just the right time to strike... Fascinating.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Giosuè Carducci：</span><br>
Um...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
Ahem. Anyway, dividing faith and secularity must entail dethroning me as Apostle, yes?<br>
I won't let her get away with that! Why, I'll crush her with my own two hands!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Raffaello：</span><br>
Then what do we do?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Giosuè Carducci：</span><br>
We should return home and call a meeting of the College of Cardinals at once.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
This is an emergency, and you want to hold meetings?!<br>
I'm in charge here. I call the shots!<br>
We are going back to Rome, and everyone is going to obey my orders!<br>
I'll figure out the strategy as we go. For now... Let's set sail at once!<br>

<br>
KABOOOM!<br>
Marco Polo's position after several clashes was far from disadvantageous. If anything, her momentum was growing and growing, and the advantage was hers.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
Is that all you have?<br>
You're weaker than I anticipated, and your aim is sloppy.<br>
You're clearly lacking in combat experience as well. Ohohohoho!<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Trento META：</span><br>
I'm impressed, Apostle. Frankly, I underestimated you.<br>
It's time to get serious.<br>
<br>
As Trento said that, she took out an intricate, black cube.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
(It's black... An Origin Cube?! They have access to THOSE things?!)<br>
<br>
All of a sudden, a red and black fog spread out and blanketed the whole river.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Trento META：</span><br>
Our power grows while inside the Eternal Night's fog.<br>
You, on the other hand, will suffer and languish due to its corrosion.<br>
Your fates have been sealed. There is nowhere to run or hide.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Maggiore Baracca：</span><br>
Dammit... She's right. This fog is corroding our equipment and bodies!<br>
Your Grace, we have to get out of the fog immediately!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
Don't be hasty! All that's happening is the power generated by the Origin Cube is spreading out.<br>
It's but a cheap trick. Do they think they can do as they please when I have God on my side?<br>
We're near a district that has a Source of God's Light. There should be power stored there. Let us find out what it can do!<br>
O God, I give my faith to you! Lend me your strength!<br>
<br>
An indescribable power surged forth, and the dark fog instantly turned ashen in color before dissipating.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Trento META：</span><br>
Wh-what? How is this possible?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
Hahah! It is possible to use the power of the Lattice of God's Light without even activating it!<br>
(For being a Siren creation, that machine sure is straightforward in use...)<br>
Did you think that was the end? It's only the beginning!<br>
<br>
Marco Polo recited another prayer of sorts. The entire area was illuminated with golden light, the bodies of her and her aides glowing especially brightly.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
This must be this world's image of Paradise... Magnificent! This will be good to reference!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Raffaello：</span><br>
Whoa... What is this? Is this brain power, too?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Giosuè Carducci：</span><br>
I never imagined you would call upon the Lattice's power like this, Your Grace!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
Ohohohoho! Save the praise for later! This is no time to talk!<br>
Stronger have we grown! Now show them your might!<br>
<br>
<br>
For the sake of safety and speed, Marco Polo's group did not choose to return directly by train.<br>
Instead, they chose Carducci's proposal – crossing a few rivers to make straight for Rome.<br>
As a result, the section of the Arno River flowing through the Republic of Florence would become the most dangerous part of the return route.<br>
They rushed along the water's surface, heading for the Sardegna Ecclesia's territory at full speed.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Maggiore Baracca：</span><br>
The riverside sent a message saying everything looks normal. We might be able to go back safely.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
I doubt it. There is no way Andrea would foolishly not anticipate that someone might take this route.<br>
She wants to capture the Apostle – me! If she didn't, she wouldn't have made Bartolomeo go through the effort of erecting an illusion to delay us!<br>
All of you, keep your eyes and ears open!<br>
<br>
KABOOOM!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Giosuè Carducci：</span><br>
Here they come... That bunch is nothing if not bold.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
What did you expect? They appeared before us to formally declare war, for goodness' sake!<br>
Ahem... If it's the Apostle you seek, then I am right here! Show yourselves and state your names!<br>
<br>
From within the dark mist, two shadowy figures slowly came into view.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Bolzano META：</span><br>
You anticipated an ambush here, I see. Perhaps you're not as incompetent as the rumors say.<br>
I am Bolzano, a knight of the Sardegnia League. It's a shame we must meet under these conditions, Your Grace.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Trento META：</span><br>
…………<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
(METAs? Again? If we assume that Andrea Doria is META as well, then...)<br>
(Perhaps their kind are commonplace in this world?)<br>
(Even Trento has turned... How strange.)<br>
Trento, if a fight is inevitable, can't we at least have some pleasantries first? Why won't you say anything?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Trento META：</span><br>
...You are Marco Polo, the Apostle, yes?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Bolzano META：</span><br>
What is it, Trento? Is something wrong with her?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Trento META：</span><br>
For some reason, this scenario is giving me an intense sense of deja vu. It's like I've experienced it in a dream...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
Is that so? Perhaps in that dream, you and I accomplished something incredible together – is that correct?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Trento META：</span><br>
...I can't remember.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Bolzano META：</span><br>
That's it, then. We've spoken long enough.<br>
Now that we've introduced ourselves, it's time you said your prayers. We won't go easy on you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
Took the words right out of my mouth!<br>
No sooner than I gained the position I desired was I forced into days of exhausting work, then when I finally got to go outside for a breather, I was attacked...<br>
My anger has reached critical mass, and you will suffer all of it!<br>
Come, girls! After me!<br>
<br>
As soon as she said those words, Marco Polo commenced the attack, to the surprise of everyone around her.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Trento META：</span><br>
You're making the first move? How bold of you!<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Bolzano META：</span><br>
Intercept them!<br>
<br>
<br>
KABOOOM!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Raffaello：</span><br>
Hahaha! Feel the power of art!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Giosuè Carducci：</span><br>
Focus fire on one of them!<br>
<br>
KABOOOM!<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Trento META：</span><br>
They're actually pushing us back...<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Bolzano META：</span><br>
It's hard to fully carry out an ambush decided on the spur of the moment.<br>
Victory is out of our grasp... We should retreat, Trento.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Trento META：</span><br>
You're right... I thought this was our chance to take her out, but alas...<br>
Next time we meet, Marco Polo, we will attack you head-on.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
Not so fast! I have a message for your boss!<br>
Tsk... They sure ran away quickly!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
Let's chase after them! They'll get away if we don't go now!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Giosuè Carducci：</span><br>
Your Grace, please be calm.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
I AM calm. Why pursue them in the first place and risk walking into another trap of theirs?<br>
Those parting words – "we will attack you head on"... They just did that!<br>
No matter. The imperative now is to return to Rome and get a full grasp on the situation. Regroup and head out at full speed!<br>

<br>
Kingdom of Naples - Borderlands<br>
Remote stronghold<br>
Inside the fort's command center, the empress of the Eternal Night was organizing the latest intel.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Giulio Cesare META：</span><br>
The Banner of Eternal Night is deploying as planned. Night has already fallen on five of the member states, including the Dukedom of Milan.<br>
As agreed, Milan will not mobilize, and the Genoan fleet is already on its way to Florence.<br>
The Republic of Venice has split in two, and its march on the Ecclesia's territory has begun. It's but a matter of time before they raise the Banner.<br>
We certainly got the jump on the Holy See. It's just a shame we couldn't kill Marco Polo.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Andrea Doria META：</span><br>
Yes, it is deplorable.<br>
The Apostle was born by a prophecy from God... We slightly underestimated her capabilities in battle.<br>
Also, I'm concerned by that strange "power of disintegration" that Trento alluded to.<br>
The Holy See may be steadily gaining control of more powerful divine weapons based on this "key."<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Giulio Cesare META：</span><br>
There is one more thing.<br>
We've confirmed that a divine army is sealed inside the Armory of God that was opened the other day. Their combat capabilities are unknown.<br>
Which is to say, there's a good chance that we will grapple with more divine troops than we anticipated.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Andrea Doria META：</span><br>
Share this information with Cavour and see what Milan thinks.<br>
What matters more than anything else is that the Banner is raised.<br>
If we can't completely convert the Lattice of God's Light into the Domain of Eternal Night, we can't get the power needed to engage the divine army on equal footing.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Giulio Cesare META：</span><br>
The power Marco Polo demonstrated may come to pose a threat to the Domain.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Andrea Doria META：</span><br>
I entrust general command to you.<br>
I'm going to head to the front line and launch the assault on Rome. I'll meet the Holy See in person.<br>

<br>
Sardegna Ecclesia - Cathedral<br>
Apostle's Office<br>
Following Trento's and Bolzano's failed ambush, the group safely arrived back in Rome.<br>
The moment they returned to the cathedral, they were swamped with report after report, more and more coming in every minute.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Giosuè Carducci：</span><br>
All nodes of up to tier three in the Two Sicilies, Venice, Genoa, and Milan have been lost.<br>
All the while, Milan hasn't taken any sort of action.<br>
Meanwhile, Florence is currently engaging a fleet from Genoa.<br>
Florence's nodes have evaded capture thus far, but their tier one nodes aren't functioning as normal due to sabotage, while tier two and three nodes are struggling to run at full power.<br>
At the same time, the first and second legation districts are being invaded by the Republic of Venice.<br>
Currently, among the 10 legation districts in which nodes are housed, over half of all tier two and three nodes have been lost.<br>
On the bright side, the tier one nodes in Bologna and Ancona remain under our control, as do the major tier two nodes in Ravenna.<br>
The situation is the worst in the fourth legation district, where all tiers of nodes were lost in the Two Sicilies' first surprise attack. The College of Cardinals ordered a full withdrawal.<br>
In the third legation district, it's not looking so good either. We're holding down the tier one nodes in Perugia, but losses exceed 40% among the tier two and three nodes.<br>
As for the capital district, damages are minimal. The enemy hasn't as much as taken one step forward for fear of what's in the Armories of God.<br>
For the moment, the most important top-tier nodes as well as the tier one through three nodes are all safe.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
...How? How have they reduced us to this in so little time?!<br>
Hang on... Something is missing from this report.<br>
How are our troop casualties? And our equipment loss?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Giosuè Carducci：</span><br>
Those are still being counted. That being said, all the fighting is focused around places with a Source of God's Light. There is no damage to major naval facilities.<br>
Administrative buildings don't seem to be the enemy's target either, so evacuating them was straightforward, and little damage was sustained.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
Hmm... It's clear what they're after. The Lattice of God's Light.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Giosuè Carducci：</span><br>
According to our intel, they've been modifying rather than destroying the nodes across all regions following their capture.<br>
They're apparently using some equipment known as "the Banner of the Eternal Night" to alter the Sources.<br>
Now, this is just my conjecture, but it looks like the Banner draws from the same source of power as Andrea's faction does for METAmorphosis, and it's something they're using to counter the Lattice of God's Light.<br>
This leads me to believe they're corroding and converting the Sources to take control of the Lattice for themselves.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
(Corroding and converting... So METAmorphosis isn't solely a destructive force.)<br>
(They seem quite adept at using it. I'll admit, it is quite fascinating...)<br>
(Still, it's concerning how they want the Lattice for themselves... That thing might present a problem.)<br>
(But wait... Andrea said something about "breaking free from God's cage," or whatever. So she means freeing themselves of the Sirens' control.)<br>
(Why, then, won't they destroy the very thing that gives the Sirens control? Don't they know the risk?)<br>
(Well, one thing is clear – my position will get worse and worse if I don't step in and do something!)<br>
(If the Sirens wanted to meddle, fine, but did they have to get me involved? Ugh! What a pain!)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Giosuè Carducci：</span><br>
Your Grace, have you figured something out?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
I'm just wondering – will the Lattice of God's Light be rendered unusable if all the captured nodes thus far were destroyed?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Giosuè Carducci：</span><br>
No, the situation isn't quite that dire.<br>
Our technical division is currently carrying out emergency modifications so that the Lattice in the vicinity of Rome can be activated independently. The work should be done within two hours.<br>
The core of the system converges around the outskirts of Rome, you see.<br>
As long as Rome still stands, even if all other nodes are lost, the Lattice can still fully encase and protect the capital. By raising its output, it can even cover most of the Ecclesia's territory to some extent.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
In other words, Rome will become their next target.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Giosuè Carducci：</span><br>
We won't let that happen. The Lattice's protective casing around Rome will be impenetrable so long as no nodes within its borders malfunction.<br>
Furthermore, since all the nodes will be under Rome's protection, they will never be able to physically reach any nodes either. They would have to breach the barrier first.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
Our enemies aren't stupid, mind you. They already planned this far ahead – they probably have a counter to this idea as well.<br>
Wait... I've got it! I know why they're capturing the nodes rather than destroying them, despite their goal of "freeing themselves"!<br>
I thought it was too absurd to be possible, but it seems I've misjudged them!<br>
Trying to unshackle themselves from the Sirens... Friedrich's exact goal. Of course they're not stupid.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Giosuè Carducci：</span><br>
I... don't quite understand what you mean, Your Grace. Other than that you seem to hold Andrea in high regard.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
Never mind that now! What matters is this: Andrea's goal is to take us down with her!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Giosuè Carducci：</span><br>
...With her, Your Grace?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
They haven't captured all of these nodes so they can keep the Lattice of God's Light under their control forever.<br>
She wants to pit the power she controls against ours and use that clash to ensure mutual destruction in the end!<br>
The more nodes they convert, the higher the likelihood that her plan will succeed.<br>
If it works, they can destroy the Lattice at minimal cost, and we'll be caught with our pants down without our defense.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Giosuè Carducci：</span><br>
Then are you saying that she's seizing the Lattice not to use it against us, but to make sure that it is destroyed?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
Yes, clearly! She made it look as though she was slowly gaining control of it in order to throw us off.<br>
She wanted us to think we were in for a protracted war and concentrate our troops in Rome so she could eliminate us in one fell swoop!<br>
Clever, clever girl... If I wasn't familiar with the game she's playing, I would've totally fallen for it!<br>
So, if she's coming to attack us... she'll most definitely do it from the sea!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Giosuè Carducci：</span><br>
...Then we must immediately relay this to the College of Cardinals and rethink our strategy.<br>
Should we become reliant on the Lattice and unable to rebuild a defensive line, we should consider the Cardinals' proposal from a while back – to carry out the Rite of the Final Judgment.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
Carry out the what now?<br>
<br>
After a cursory look at some documents and having finished the necessary preparations, Marco Polo and Raffaello traversed a tunnel under the cathedral toward where the Rite was to be held.<br>
The Rite of the Final Judgment – it was a ceremonial procedure that was discovered in the Armory of God that Marco Polo previously opened. The place where the Rite was to be held was discovered on the same day.<br>
The Rite was to be performed by the Apostle alone, and Marco Polo was not to be accompanied by anyone.<br>
Yet, for some reason, she decided to take advantage of the chaos and bring Raffaello with her.<br>
After walking through the tunnel for some time, they arrived in a large room with an atmosphere much like that of the Armory of God.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Raffaello：</span><br>
The ceremony spot is just up ahead. Just walk up to that control panel in the middle of the hall. All I gotta do is stand by, right?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
Yes. Just wait over here. I'll go have a look.<br>
<br>
Marco Polo walked up to the hall's center and gazed up at the massive sculpture before her that radiated a holy light.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
A bit over the top if you ask me, but...<br>
<br>
Gazing back down, she saw what clearly looked to be a Siren-made control device, blue patterns sticking out from its black, metallic surface.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
Typical Siren design.<br>
<br>
For the Rite of the Final Judgment, the chosen shipgirl Apostle would first interface directly with the doomsday device left by God and overcome the trials it presented.<br>
Should she emerge triumphant, the doomsday device would awaken the divine armies resting all across the archipelago and smite all of the Ecclesia's foes, letting God's light shine forever.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
Alright. Let's see what this thing wants me to do.<br>
<br>
The instant that she put her hands on the doomsday device, her surroundings changed completely.<br>
"On the first day, the army of nonbelievers approached."<br>
"On the second day, Rome was engulfed in flames."<br>
"On the third day, Sardegnia was engulfed by the long dark."<br>
"On the fourth day, the divine army finally awoke."<br>
"On the fifth day, the Domain of Eternal Night collapsed."<br>
"On the sixth day, the judgment of Paradise Lost came a second time."<br>
"On the seventh day, God's light shone forever upon the world."<br>
A while later, Marco Polo regained consciousness.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
..."On the seventh day, God's light shone forever upon the world."<br>
I get it. This is the synopsis of the tale the Sirens wrote. Andrea was completely right.<br>
They want to free themselves, so they were going to plunge the Holy See into crisis, leaving me with no option but to assist them in achieving their goals...<br>
Unfortunately for them, I'm not going to fall for that. I have no interest in the Sirens' plays.<br>
I mustn't allow the power gathered through the Rite to go to waste...<br>
If we're to awaken something to place our faith and hopes in, let it not be the Sirens, but rather what I myself believe in!<br>
<br>
With a plan in mind, Marco Polo returned to Raffaello.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Raffaello：</span><br>
Well? Think the ritual will go well?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
Of course, but I have an even better plan.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Raffaello：</span><br>
Even better? Sounds like there's a reason why you brought me along.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
First of all, do you think that story circulated by Andrea's faction is true or false?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Raffaello：</span><br>
Uhh... I'm just a painter. What would I know about that?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
Alright, then let's suppose Andrea came to you with money and a commission. Would you draw for her or not?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Raffaello：</span><br>
I would, obviously. I've done stuff like that before.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
And what if I was the one paying?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Raffaello：</span><br>
Then that's even more reason to draw. What do you have in mind?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
Magnificent. So, my commission is as follows...<br>
<br>
After Marco Polo had given Raffaello as much detail as she could possibly muster and even a few diagrams she made herself, Raffaello finally understood what to draw.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Raffaello：</span><br>
Are you sure you want me to draw this? It's beyond eccentric – it borders on the unsettling.<br>
Is this really your image of God? Never heard anyone pin an appearance like this to 'em...<br>
Also, do you even need this for the Rite?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
I am the Apostle, am I not?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Raffaello：</span><br>
Well, yeah.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
And who would know better about God and rituals than the Apostle herself?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Raffaello：</span><br>
Nobody. 'Cause you're the Apostle.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
There you go, you dolt. Fine, what if I double your remuneration?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Raffaello：</span><br>
Well, the customer is always right! Your bidding is my command, Your Grace!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
Magnificent! O God, behold the grand stage which I shall offer to thee!<br>

Unknown time<br>
The sound of the chorus had faded, but the pure-white world stretched on infinitely.<br>
There was no more concept of "inside" or "outside" the doors, and distance became meaningless. Even time and space gradually lost meaning.<br>
Finally, among the infinite whiteness, a single figure appeared.<br>
<span style="color:#bdbdbd;">Hatakaze META：</span><br>
Weird... Why is it so quiet here?<br>
I had to fight through violent tides the whole way over.<br>
Wait... Am I sensing something invisible?<br>
Begin inspection. Reveal the truth of this place to me!<br>
<br>
A figure took form for an instant, but it disappeared once more.<br>
<span style="color:#bdbdbd;">Hatakaze META：</span><br>
Goodness, such a high level...<br>
Hold it, I recognize you. Antiochus?<br>
Are you the one who calmed this place so much?<br>
I see... You've advanced in level, but you're still trapped here?<br>
Mine is too low to help you... but I do have an idea to help you.<br>
Release me, and I will help you descend!<br>
<br>
It was then that another figure appeared.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
The situation is as dire as they come, but I'm helpless to act...<br>
O God, thy power must be mine.<br>
I know... that you want to descend upon this world.<br>
I'll use your power to create the Kingdom of God... The beginning of a blissful, eternal age of glory for all of mankind, free of danger.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Marco Polo? Are these her memories from before the false god's arrival?)<br>
<br>
I reach out my hand and touch the soliloquizing figure, but when I do, all turns to endless white again.<br>
This makes me realize that I'm still in the gate.<br>
The chorus begins anew.<br>

<br>
After five rounds of revision, Marco Polo finally found herself satisfied.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
Hmm... Not bad! Great painter, indeed – your rendition is nothing short of beautiful!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Raffaello：</span><br>
I'm glad you're happy, Your Grace!<br>
At least you didn't tell me to undo all of the revisions in the end...<br>
Anyway! Now that the painting is done, what do you want to do?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
Heheh... I plan to modify the Rite of the Final Judgment to yield new results!<br>
Not to awaken these so-called divine armies, but to herald the appearance of the one true God!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Raffaello：</span><br>
……？<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
What is that look in your eye? Do you think the Apostle Marco Polo would fail?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Raffaello：</span><br>
No, no! I know that nobody knows God better than you, Your Grace!<br>
But to be honest... the God in this painting is strange. Like, really weird.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
Do you find it any stranger than divine weapons and armies?<br>
I won't hide the truth from you. Andrea's talk of stories and cages? It's all true.<br>
I saw the script of said story with my own two eyes.<br>
If I carry out the rite as written, Paradise Lost will befall this world once more.<br>
The divine weapons will return, an Apostle will hold all the power, and the world will be forever ruled by God's hands.<br>
Your God has another name: The Sirens.<br>
This very world is but another of their twisted test sites.<br>
Here they test faith, and you – and everyone else born here – are their guinea pigs.<br>
"Cage" is an apt descriptor for this world, really.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Raffaello：</span><br>
The world is a cage...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
Please. You must have had some inkling of it.<br>
Da Vinci realized it, too. Otherwise, you two wouldn't use "brain power" to describe the so-called power of faith. To be quite honest, I happen to like that phrase.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Raffaello：</span><br>
Ahahaha... Nothing gets past you, Your Grace.<br>
I do generally support Andrea's idea of reforming faith and the Church.<br>
But I didn't think she would be so radical, let alone that she'd start a war over it!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
She panicked when she learned of my appearance, because she thought I would mobilize the divine army.<br>
Yet nobody ever stopped to question whether I wanted to fight in the first place!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Raffaello：</span><br>
Umm... DO you want to fight, Your Grace?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
Absolutely not!<br>
Hell, if she'd come and TALKED to me, I would've joined her!<br>
Better we fight our common enemy together than squabble among ourselves!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Raffaello：</span><br>
...The Apostle herself would rebel against the Holy See?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
It's called righting the course.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Raffaello：</span><br>
But our factions are already fighting. There's nothing we can do now, is there?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
There's still time! We may have lost the nodes of the Lattice of God's Light, but fortunately, there has been little loss of actual life.<br>
Our army can still act. It's the perfect time for a bit of deceit!<br>
Heheh, I might've failed last time, but I am the kind of woman who knows how to learn from mistakes!<br>
God's given me a second chance.<br>
And damn it, I'll do it right this time!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Raffaello：</span><br>
Did you say "last time"?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
It's a long story. I'll tell you another time.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Raffaello：</span><br>
Okay, what about the whole deceit thing? What are we doing?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
I have a plan, but the two of us can't accomplish it alone.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Raffaello：</span><br>
Then let's get Carducci and the others involved! They won't say it out loud, but I know how they feel, so don't worry!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
Well, well, what a coincidence. I was just thinking the same thing.<br>
Go back to them and tell them there was an issue with the Rite. Have them come to me.<br>
And then...<br>

<br>
KABOOOM!<br>
Using the power granted by the Lattice of God's Light, Raffaello cut the distance to Andrea in the blink of an eye.<br>
Andrea, meanwhile, began to brandish the power of the Domain of Eternal Night. Instantly, the world was split between light and dark.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Andrea Doria META：</span><br>
Raffaello, you have walked into a trap.<br>
Stall for time if you so wish, but have you thought about why I'm not doing the same?<br>
Do you think Rome is untouchable as long as you have the Lattice of God's Light?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Raffaello：</span><br>
Nah. The thing is, Marco Polo knows you want to take us down with you, which'll result in the Lattice's destruction.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Andrea Doria META：</span><br>
"Take you down with me"... An interesting way to phrase it. If you've seen through my plan, why deploy your forces like this, then?<br>
Is that ritual of hers really worth staking everything on?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Raffaello：</span><br>
I wouldn't say the ritual is that important – it's you who's the most important.<br>
The reason I'm here is to talk to you, plain and simple.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Andrea Doria META：</span><br>
What is there to talk about after we've come this far? You're not thinking about switching sides, are you?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Raffaello：</span><br>
Uh, no. Speaking in terms of composition, we're the champions of light and you're the warriors of darkness.<br>
...But out of curiosity, if you wanted me to join the dark side, what kind of deal would you offer me?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Andrea Doria META：</span><br>
How about double whatever the Ecclesia is paying you?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Raffaello：</span><br>
Ooh, an enticing offer! But I'll have to say no thanks. Tell me the truth about the world, will you?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Andrea Doria META：</span><br>
…………<br>
Everything I've said is the truth.<br>
The "God" the Holy See has worshipped for all this time is a bunch of ancient machines. Robots, in essence.<br>
They made up a religion and used the Holy See to manipulate the world based on that false belief. All as the pretense – the story – for their experiments.<br>
Their relics, not least of all the Lattice that you're using right now, pose a disastrous threat to the world.<br>
The relics exist for one purpose – to turn us all into puppets who dance at their command in the name of faith.<br>
Do you even know what the ending is to this story that they've come up with?<br>
Even if you beat us into submission and do exactly what they want you to, all that awaits you in the end is death and devastation.<br>
It's called a "reset," and it wipes out both their most loyal followers and their most staunch opponents.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Raffaello：</span><br>
I mean, I think I've basically conformed to the status quo, but that doesn't mean I really believed in God.<br>
That's why I approve of the revolution you've been working toward.<br>
I just didn't expect that you'd do it by dragging your allies into an all-out war.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Andrea Doria META：</span><br>
I'm trying to keep casualties on both sides to a minimum. You already know that, don't you?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Raffaello：</span><br>
"Minimum" doesn't mean "none."<br>
Besides, think about it. You didn't go to war because of the threat of the Rite of the Final Judgment – you did it because the Lattice was going to be activated.<br>
Sure, it'll lead to the world's downfall one day if left unchecked, but you don't know whether that one day will be tomorrow or a thousand years from now.<br>
Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying that what you're doing here is wrong.<br>
But, if you know the Sirens are manipulating us all, have you not considered that this war may be just another part of their story?<br>
You jumped the gun a little bit, and, well... here we are.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Andrea Doria META：</span><br>
I was out of time. A shipgirl Apostle had been born, and the Holy See had the key to activate those divine weapons.<br>
I know what's resting inside of the 9th Armory of God. Other places like it exist across the Ecclesia, and only – and I mean ONLY – the Apostle can control the divine army once awakened.<br>
With that kind of power, nobody would be able to challenge the Holy See, and as the executioners of "God's" experiments, they would put unbreakable shackles on all of us.<br>
But that hasn't happened yet. The cage hasn't been locked shut just yet. That was why I had to act.<br>
This was my one and only hope.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Raffaello：</span><br>
Okay, so you're mostly on the right track, but you're forgetting about one crucial thing.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Andrea Doria META：</span><br>
One crucial thing?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Raffaello：</span><br>
Yeah. What if – seriously, what if – Marco Polo already knew all of this?<br>
And what if she not only knew more than you, but she was trying to do the same thing as you – to destroy the cage around us?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Andrea Doria META：</span><br>
……？<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Raffaello：</span><br>
It's like I said earlier. I just came here to talk to you.<br>
I'll be real with you – Marco Polo has come up with an unbelievable plan to fix everything.<br>
We'll both get what we want if you help her with it.<br>
Interested? Then hear me out for a bit.<br>
<br>
Sometime earlier, at the Rite of the Final Judgment's ritual grounds...<br>
Marco Polo gathered her aides under the pretense of a problem with the Rite, then proceeded to tell them the same thing as she told Raffaello just earlier.<br>
As Raffaello anticipated, they readily offered to cooperate with her.<br>
It was then that Marco Polo began to detail her plan.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
Let me make this clear: I know what I'm doing, and you are all to follow my instructions!<br>
Our forces have already been concentrated in Rome. Andrea is similarly amassing her own forces.<br>
What God expects to happen next is an all-out war between the two of us.<br>
However, I will not be playing into His hand!<br>
We are going to broach discussions with Andrea in secret. We give the impression that we're fighting while actually working together.<br>
Then, under God's watch, we will focus our forces in one place in a way He will never see coming.<br>
Then the plan begins in earnest. We will activate the divine army and use our might to destroy each and every one of God's weapons.<br>
Both sides will join forces, and after our armies have arrived, we will modify the Rite and make it so God's weapons can no longer be strengthened by the power of faith.<br>
And not just that – we'll issue self-destruct orders, switch off defense systems, and give contradicting orders. Anything we can to put them in utter disarray.<br>
When the divine army is at its weakest, we will all march on Rome and wipe it out!<br>
Once that cursed army is completely annihilated, the world will be free from its cage.<br>
I will remain as the Apostle and the Ecclesia's army will follow the Holy See's commands. My commands, in other words.<br>
And we'll all live happily ever after. The end!<br>
Oh, and don't worry, the army won't question my orders. They'll believe me if I say they came to me in a revelation in this place.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Raffaello：</span><br>
Wow... They'll buy it, just like that?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Giosuè Carducci：</span><br>
This is certainly an... unexpected plan.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Maggiore Baracca：</span><br>
Sounds risky. Just the way I like it!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
Right? Now, for the concrete details of this plan...<br>
<br>
Raffaello explained Marco Polo's plan from start to finish, and Andrea was dumbfounded from sheer surprise.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Raffaello：</span><br>
So yeah, that's more or less the idea.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Andrea Doria META：</span><br>
Marco Polo sure is a woman of... unconventional brilliance.<br>
I hate to admit it, but it's a very appealing plan.<br>
I still cannot trust her, though. You must understand – at the end of the day, she serves "God." She is the chosen one who was born in the Shipyard of God.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Raffaello：</span><br>
So you want proof of her rebellion, huh? Don't worry, as we speak, she is taking faith in God and turning it into faith in her.<br>
Once that's done, you'll know exactly where she stands!<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Andrea Doria META：</span><br>
Faith in... her? How in the world will she do that?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Raffaello：</span><br>
The power to come up with things is in the heart of each and every one of us.<br>
Anyway, let's separate a bit and keep up the appearance that we're in a standoff! Then just sit back and watch as her masterful plan unfolds!<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Andrea Doria META：</span><br>
Alright. From there, I will determine her true worth.<br>
<br>
<br>
A while later, Marco Polo and Raffaello returned after their secret talk at the ritual grounds and reorganized their forces.<br>
They were going to withdraw their troops and allow Andrea's faction to capture every node of the Lattice of God's Light.<br>
At the same time, their whole army would converge upon Rome and make it appear as though they were conducting a massive ritual to buy themselves time out of desperation.<br>
Sure enough, Andrea Doria took notice and launched a naval attack with the brunt of her force, just as Marco Polo predicted.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Andrea Doria META：</span><br>
We meet again, Raffaello. I'm quite surprised to see that you're leading the Ecclesia's navy.<br>
Where is your leader – Marco Polo?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Raffaello：</span><br>
Her Grace is, well, busy, so she kinda just threw her arms up and told me to take care of the trouble here.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Andrea Doria META：</span><br>
"Threw her arms up," you say? She must have put a lot of faith into this ritual of hers. No pun intended.<br>
And yet, she has surrendered so many nodes to buy herself some time.<br>
It frankly doesn't seem like the smartest idea, does it?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Raffaello：</span><br>
Maybe, maybe not. I'll let you enjoy the suspense.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">Bartolomeo Colleoni：</span><br>
Andrea, I'm starting to think Raffaello is also stalling for time.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Andrea Doria META：</span><br>
Yes, and I've said my piece. All there is to do now is attack head-on.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Raffaello：</span><br>
Fine by me. I'll be coming at you as straight as spaghetti!<br>
Da Vinci, Alfredo, remember the plan!<br>
Do everything you can to hold the others back while I go and persuade Andrea!<br>

Am I right to assume that you're stuck in this place?<br>
And you've been wanting to escape. It's why you teamed up with the META Hatakaze and tried to create a "Kingdom of God" for Marco Polo.<br>

<span style="color:#bdbdbd;">▅H▊▇ro▅■ph▇▆▅：</span><br>

Although the statue still does not say a word, for a moment, it looks like there's a glimmer in its gemstone-like eyes.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I'm sure what's happening to Marco Polo now also has something to do with you.<br>
What have you done to her?<br>
<br>
The calm whiteness starts to shiver, like a rising tide is pressing in on all sides.<br>
The very next moment, the soundless waves come flooding in.<br>
Everything except the waves rapidly dissolves like ice, eventually leaving nothing but a void.<br>
Then, from the gaps between the snow-white waves, Marco Polo's figure comes into view.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
"O God, I give you all my faith."<br>

With one more utterance from the chorus, a colossal weapon known as a Gazer reveals itself.<br>
Then, another white wave washes in, replacing everything with a blank nothingness.<br>
The endless expanse of white regains its calm, and the statue is still silent.<br>
Even so, in the jewels of its eyes, I can clearly make out Marco Polo's figure.<br>
It seems that she and Hierophant have forged a deep bond.<br>
Having seen all these things, I have a plethora of questions to ask, but I don't even know where to start.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
She is using your power to fight the Sirens.<br>

<br>
Marco Polo's ritual of faith conversion had clear and immediate effects.<br>
A power of faith hitherto unknown to this world surged forth from Rome, transmitting along the Lattice of God's Light.<br>
A familiar yet strangely foreign air condensed in the skies of the Apennine Archipelago, signaling to the world the birth of a new being.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Raffaello：</span><br>
Looks like her ritual's complete! See? No divine army to be seen and you're all still alive.<br>
Most telling of all is this surge of brain power. It does not lie.<br>
So? Do you believe me now?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Andrea Doria META：</span><br>
Marco Polo... You're piquing my curiosity more by the minute.<br>
She actually altered the ritual "God" left behind... and she used it to create a new type of faith?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Raffaello：</span><br>
I don't know all the nitty-gritty, but it sure looks that way.<br>
She said the faith is now for a real God – one who can help us take down anyone or anything that's out for us.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Andrea Doria META：</span><br>
It looks... extremely suspicious.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Raffaello：</span><br>
Yeah. I'm the one who had to draw it up, so I'd know!<br>
Still, she IS the Apostle, so if anyone knows how to use faith for good, it's her.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Andrea Doria META：</span><br>
Are you saying you believe in that "God"?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Raffaello：</span><br>
I wouldn't say I believe in it, but I don't disbelieve in it either.<br>
Oh, I got a message from Marco Polo. She says she wants to talk to you.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Andrea Doria META：</span><br>
Very well.<br>
<br>
Thus, Marco Polo and Andrea initiated a conversation over the phone.<br>
Since Andrea was up to speed, the conversation went extremely smoothly.<br>
Both sides laid out and agreed to a truce, then they swiftly began to formulate their next plan.<br>
But, just as everything was going swimmingly...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Communicator：</span><br>
BEEP BEEP!<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Giulio Cesare META：</span><br>
Andrea, the divine army launched an attack on us out of nowhere!<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Andrea Doria META：</span><br>
What? The divine army?!<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Giulio Cesare META：</span><br>
Yes. They're attacking Venice, Genoa, and Milan all at the same time. We must mount a response posthaste.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Andrea Doria META：</span><br>
But why? Why are they attacking?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Raffaello：</span><br>
Huh? Don't look at me! I have no idea!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
Come again? The divine army is staging an attack?!<br>
I can tell you right now, I have eyes on the 9th Armory of God, and nothing has happened there.<br>
In other words, I had nothing to do with this!<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Andrea Doria META：</span><br>
Okay... So it wasn't you, then.<br>
Then the attackers must've been divine armies that lay dormant across the League. Ones so well hidden, even we weren't aware of them.<br>
I suspect that "God" sensed a threat and forcibly commenced the Rite of the Final Judgment.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
Hmph. If He thinks He can try, let Him! The power I command now should strike fear in the heart of even God!<br>
You know what? I'm going to stop calling these wretches "God." I don't want any confusion between them and my God.<br>
Let's just agree to call them Sirens, alright?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Andrea Doria META：</span><br>
Sirens? Okay, and what does "God" mean to you, then?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
God, simply! What else? I'm renaming them Sirens now to avoid confusion, so if you want me to redefine "God," that defeats the whole point!<br>
Ahem... That aside, we can't put the divine army genie back in the bottle now, but the Siren weapons in and around Rome are still under our control.<br>
Curse those Sirens and their schemes... I thought I'd caught them unawares!<br>
Instead, they strike just as we joined forces and were about to hit them where it hurts! This isn't what was supposed to happen!<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Andrea Doria META：</span><br>
They built this cage over a thousand years. Of course escaping it won't be easy.<br>
We still have a chance, though. Before anything else, we should group up and relocate our headquarters.<br>
There is no better time than now to knock out the Sirens surrounding Rome.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
Heheh, my thoughts exactly. Let's deal with what's on the table first!<br>

？？？·？？？<br>
？？？？<br>
The statue in the endless white expanse is as silent as ever, but the sights reflected in its eyes are changing every moment.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Is that... Marco Polo? Are these more memories?<br>
No, not quite. It feels like it's happening in the present... like it's unfolding right now.<br>
They were performing some strange ritual, then redeploying their forces...<br>
So while her body is sound asleep, her mind is off on these unbelievable escapades?<br>
<br>
There is nothing but silence from the statue.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Well, from what I can tell, you're trapped somewhere for some reason.<br>
What I'm seeing here is just a projection that I can recognize.<br>
You can probably see me to some extent just as I can see you, but who knows how much information is being relayed to you.<br>
Am I supposed to make a clear and definite wish to you if I want you to answer any of my questions?<br>
Marco Polo did that once, so...<br>
<br>
There is nothing but silence from the statue.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(I'll give it a try. It can't hurt.)<br>
Hierophant, please show me any information pertaining to Marco Polo's location.<br>
<br>
I make a wish to the statue.<br>
Not long after, another door appears.<br>
I reach out to touch it, and everything changes abruptly.<br>

Sardegna Ecclesia - Capital<br>
Sardegnia League Joint Operation Headquarters<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Giosuè Carducci：</span><br>
Thanks to your orders, Your Grace, the Sirens' army is in complete chaos.<br>
The Ecclesia's efforts to exterminate them is proceeding extremely smoothly.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
Ohohoho! Of course it is! Now, any news on Andrea? Has she managed to relocate her command center?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Giosuè Carducci：</span><br>
Yes, that is done.<br>
As you've ordered, she has also been lent Florence's Sources of God's Light in order to maintain the Domain of Eternal Night.<br>
It's going very well on her end, thanks to the... many strings they pulled to gain the upper hand in the war.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
That worked to our benefit as well, so it's fine. And since we're on the same page, any advantage she can spare for us will make our job easier.<br>
How are things on the other fronts?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Giosuè Carducci：</span><br>
The Sirens' armies are conducting a fierce attack. Three of them have breached nearby states' territory and are heading for Rome.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
Well, well, they're clearly after me.<br>
How magnificent! If they're split in three, that makes it easier to pick off one at a time.<br>
Now, the Lattice of God's Light has many nodes, so how does the network connecting these nodes function?<br>
I believe it was called the microlayer transference system...<br>
At least, that's what I got out of Veneto back then...<br>
Ah, I've got it! We'll use the transference system to strike where the enemy least expects it!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Raffaello：</span><br>
Micro-what now? What did you say?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
The portal-like thing that lets you quickly move to where a node is located.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Raffaello：</span><br>
Uhh... Giosuè, does the Lattice have a function like that?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Giosuè Carducci：</span><br>
If it does, I've certainly never heard of it before.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
What? You haven't?!<br>
<br>
Meanwhile, in the boundless land of white...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
………………<br>
<br>
Through the eyes of the stone statue, I've grasped what's happening in Marco Polo's World.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
During the near-superimposition event, Clemenceau took Compiler's microlayer transference system and modified it. It wasn't part of her original plan.<br>
But wait... When Richelieu had the system activated, Marco Polo had already been thrown into the sea. How and when did Marco learn about it from Veneto?<br>
She never even told me about it. Maybe it was when Shinano brought Veneto into Marco's dream.<br>
...She really knows how to exploit every opportunity she gets.<br>
And the way she manifested a weapon with the power of thought, just like at the World Expo...<br>
Then there are those airships. Da Vinci made good use of those once.<br>
At any rate, let's see what Marco's next move is.<br>
<br>
Inside a desolate world overrun with thorns, religious thoughts collided with one another in the air.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
What's this? I was in the headquarters a moment ago! Where am I?<br>
Eagles? And... a fleet of airships?<br>
Hold on a moment – is this a memory from the opening ceremony of the World Expo?<br>
Ahh, I see now... This must be a revelation from God.<br>
Yes, indeed... The power of faith passes through the Lattice of God's Light and accumulates here!<br>
An airship fleet... I like the sound of that.<br>
But, if we're going to use the imagery of Rome, it's best to do so in Florence. I'll have da Vinci handle that.<br>
Now, if one were to try to materialize concepts relating to God...<br>
<br>
Four horses in the colors white, red, black, and green crossed Marco Polo's mind.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
I have to admit, that woman has decent taste...<br>
Mechanicus Harbingers, you will be my pick!<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=Gate VIII-X|选项=24|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<br>
With the power of conception in her hand, Marco Polo materialized the Mechanicus Harbingers, familiar sights from both the World Expo and the Kerguelen Islands.<br>
At the same time, she ordered Raffaello to travel to Florence and manifest a fleet of airships.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
It's a start... but it's not enough.<br>
If I can use the Sources of God's Light to replicate God's Kingdom and bring Him to us, then maybe...<br>
<br>
Meanwhile, in the boundless land of white...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Huh? What the hell is this?<br>
<br>
Marco Polo suddenly issued a series of orders that were identical to what I came up with just a moment ago.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I'm going to assume she didn't develop and master telepathy all of a sudden...<br>
That leaves just one option. Hierophant, are you relaying my thoughts to her?<br>
That's why she began manifesting all those weapons and got ready for you to descend to earth. Right?<br>
Was this your goal all along?<br>
Was it all to replicate the conditions of the near-superimposition event in a new test site so she could herald your arrival?<br>
<br>
There is nothing but silence from the statue.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
No... If that was your goal, there would've been no need to involve me.<br>
Then you must have some other motive...<br>
Whatever that may be, I know one thing for sure: That ritual is far too dangerous.<br>
Even with the limitations of a Mirror Sea during your first attempt, the superimposition almost came to be. There would've been no turning back then.<br>
How are you going to finish it this time?<br>
Tell me, Hierophant. I want to know your plans.<br>
<br>
I ask the statue for answers.<br>
Not long after, another door appears.<br>
I reach out to touch it, and everything changes abruptly.<br>
Record 04800501-17<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Arbiter: The Chariot VII：</span><br>
I wish you would've delayed the shutdown just a little, Lady Hierophant. The protocol would've wiped Sardegnia Island completely clean by now.<br>
Now I must go to great lengths to hide it for you.<br>
I'm aware that you know nothing about this task. That's why I restored the META research facilities for you.<br>
Is there anything else I can do?<br>
...I only asked out of politeness. You weren't supposed to actually ask for more help.<br>
...I have to repair ALL of it? Are you pulling my leg?<br>
...You can't do it by yourself?<br>
I knew you were inept, but not to THIS extent.<br>
Have you no pride as a self-improving AI weapon?<br>
...You are so, so lucky that I promised I would assist.<br>
If you have trouble in the future, save it for Devil. I'm done working with you.<br>
...I can understand the Ruins of God. Same with the Armories of God – but what in the world is the "Shipyard of God" and "Garden of God"?<br>
You know what? Forget I asked. This is what I get for having an interest in someone's experiments.<br>
The Wisdom Cubes will be distributed as "gifts from God," as you asked.<br>
Let's hope the final result of your experiment will be... interesting. Heheheh.<br>
<br>
As it has this whole time, the statue maintains its silence.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(I feel like I just got a glimpse of a side of Hierophant that few ever get.)<br>
(Chariot, huh? Another Arbiter whose image I should commit to memory.)<br>
<br>
Another door appears.<br>
Record 14531224-472<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Andrea Doria：</span><br>
The sky and sea change so dramatically once you pierce the Veil...<br>
The rumors were true, Cesare. Sardegnia Island wasn't obliterated – it was just hidden by God!<br>
What a hideous sight... It's as though a war took place here.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Giulio Cesare：</span><br>
Andrea, I've sighted a cluster of remarkably intact buildings. There's some writing that I can't read. Mind taking a look?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Andrea Doria：</span><br>
Sure. Let me see.<br>
It says... "Conceptual and META Bidirectional Interference Experiment Laboratory"?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Giulio Cesare：</span><br>
A laboratory? In this place?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Andrea Doria：</span><br>
Hey, is it just me... or have you also not been able to sense the power of faith since we came in here? It should be able to be felt from anywhere.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Giulio Cesare：</span><br>
Yes, now that you mention it...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Andrea Doria：</span><br>
There must be earthshaking secrets lying in this hidden battleground...<br>
We have to scour this place thoroughly!<br>
<br>
As it has this whole time, the statue maintains its silence.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
...That's why test site ES-13161 is home to so many METAs.<br>
They took advantage of the Sirens' abandoned facilities and willingly underwent METAmorphosis.<br>
So there exists technology that can induce controlled METAmorphosis... Assuming it really can be controlled, that is.<br>
<br>
Another door appears.<br>
Record 04800924-51<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Arbiter: The Chariot VII：</span><br>
Restructuring of the security system is complete.<br>
I have also created 255 sub-options to meet the various needs of your experiments.<br>
The buttons for options 1 through 255 are all here. Don't touch anything besides these.<br>
Also refrain from touching buttons 251 through 255. They initiate emergency backup plans I set up for you.<br>
Finally, I've positioned one of my own MECHArbitrators here.<br>
Don't say anything about it not being enough. One MECHArbitrator can endure more punishment than a combined fleet can dish out in over a thousand years.<br>
I'm going to be busy for a few days now while I write a manual for you. When that's done, I'm not coming back here ever again.<br>
While I'd love to see the experiment's results, I'm not going to sit around for centuries waiting for them.<br>
Let me know when the results are in.<br>
<br>
As it has this whole time, the statue maintains its silence.<br>
I wait for a minute or two, but no other doors appear.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
What I gathered from that is that Chariot constructed the defense system of test site ES-131618 and only you can control it.<br>
But, since you're in your... current state, the defense system is working automatically.<br>
The fiercest part of the system is a MECHArbiter, and apparently, it would be impossible to take down even if the whole test site worked together.<br>
Therefore, the one and only way they could survive was if you used Marco Polo to bring you down to earth, right?<br>
Did you nudge her in the direction of the Sardegnia Island Mirror Sea in order to minimize potential collateral damage caused by the ritual?<br>
Seeing as it's under the control of Andrea's side, they should be able to keep collateral fairly low.<br>
Now I understand everything that's happened so far. Marco Polo and that world face a potential apocalypse.<br>
I'm not sure how well Marco Polo will be able to control the collateral of the ritual, either...<br>
You still have yet to tell me – what exactly do you want my help with?<br>
Is there anything that isn't going exactly how you planned it?<br>
<br>
Silence. The statue offers no answers, and my voice echoes hollowly in this horizonless stretch of white nothingness.<br>

<br>
Sardegna Ecclesia - Capital<br>
Cathedral - Somewhere underground<br>
After witnessing the same series of visions as the Commander did, Marco Polo fell into deep thought.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
(If those visions are true... that means Sardegnia Island was not destroyed by Paradise Lost, merely concealed by a Mirror Sea.)<br>
(Andrea has long known this secret, and she captured the island and that META research laboratory in secret.)<br>
(The cornerstone of this branch's security system is a massive mech known as MECHArbiter: The Chariot.)<br>
(Hmm... So did God just give me a divine revelation to use the light of Heaven to get rid of that steel beast?)<br>
<br>
She went through the bits of information in her head, then reached a conclusion.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
(The revelation is clear. That being the case, I should stick to the plan.)<br>
(Said plan being divided into two steps: Luring out the enemy, then annihilating it.)<br>
(The latter isn't that much of a problem. However powerful it is, it should be fine as long as I can fully materialize the Kingdom of God and throw an army of Gazers at it.)<br>
(So luring it out will be the tricky part. This MECHArbiter hasn't as much as shown a glimpse of itself yet!)<br>
(The Sirens are still preserving their forces... I need to make them escalate.)<br>
(We could use my Kingdom of God ritual as bait, but setting it up will take time, and forget about catching them by surprise if we're too conspicuous...)<br>
(What else is there? Ah, right, Raffaello is good at these things. I'll ask her.)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Communicator：</span><br>
BEEP!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Raffaello：</span><br>
Hmm... A way to make the Sirens escalate...<br>
How about making it look like we're gonna blow Rome to bits?<br>
Like, what if we took that mutual destruction plan Andrea had and turned it up to eleven?<br>
The Sirens want you and the METAs to be at each other's throats, right? It's their goal, methinks.<br>
So what if it seemed like the METAs were about to destroy the capital before that goal was achieved?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
A magnificent idea! That's ideal for Andrea to transfer the core node of the Domain of Eternal Night to Sardegnia Island.<br>
Not only will it draw out the enemy, but also it will make them turn their their sights to that island. A textbook example of baiting the enemy!<br>
Andrea at once to– No, focus on manifesting the Mechanicus Harbingers! I will personally go and speak to Andrea.<br>
Once the MECHArbiter is defeated, all that will remain are disordered small fry!<br>
Ohohoho! What an ingenious plan!<br>

<br>
Unknown location<br>
Unknown time<br>
I watched through the statue's eyes as Marco Polo traveled to Sardegnia Island in a great hurry.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
So that's what you were planning...<br>
Judging by her reaction, though, she didn't see records as they were – rather, you showed her doctored visions, didn't you?<br>
<br>
While the statue remains silent, I feel like it's silently confirming my suspicions. If Marco Polo had seen the same things as I, she wouldn't have reacted to Hierophant.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Let me guess. You aren't presenting yourself to her as "God" on purpose, but the time to clear up that misunderstanding has passed, and now you're simply going along with it – right?<br>
<br>
That amusing possibility crosses my mind.<br>
<span style="color:#bdbdbd;">▅H▊▇ro▅■ph▇▆▅：</span><br>
…………<br>
<br>
Somehow, I get the feeling that the statue averted its gaze for but a moment.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
...Can Marco Polo really deal with the MECHArbiter with the information you've given her?<br>
Chariot said something about her MECHArbiter having the strength to rival the entire test site all at once, didn't she?<br>
<span style="color:#bdbdbd;">▅H▊▇ro▅■ph▇▆▅：</span><br>
…………<br>
<br>
Although a statue cannot express emotions, it feels like it just looked away anxiously.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I'm starting to figure out why you dragged me into this.<br>
Marco Polo and her subjects wield the collective power of the mind, while Andrea and her supporters have the corrosive might of METAmorphosis on their side.<br>
"Bring the other down with them." "Neutralization phenomenon between polar opposites." The powers you gave them will be the key to victory against your army in this world.<br>
In the branch I come from, we did something similar for dealing with the protective barriers of Tester, Purifier, and Omitter.<br>
Tell me, Hierophant. Does the MECHArbiter have an adaptive barrier of its own?<br>
<br>
Just a stone's throw away, another door appears.<br>
I reach out to touch it, and everything changes abruptly.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Arbiter: The Chariot VII：</span><br>
Yes.<br>
<br>
I'm then returned to the white expanse again.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Huh?</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：What?</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项3：Come again?</span>'''''<br>
<br>
Only silence from the statue answers me.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Once the barrier adapts too much in one direction, it becomes hard for it to pivot in another direction. That property can be exploited.<br>
It's like heating steel to high temperatures, then rapidly cooling it to make it brittle. You just have to "quench" the barrier.<br>
When the MECHArbiter appears, Andrea's group will begin by attacking the barrier with the power of the Domain of Eternal Night. They'll be the figurative fire that heats the steel.<br>
Meanwhile, the Sardegnia League will raise the Banner of the Eternal Night over as many nodes as possible, amplifying the strength of META corrosion.<br>
Marco Polo will set up the ritual on Sardegnia Island, halt it at the last moment before the Kingdom of God materializes, then wait for the right time.<br>
That's when they'll spring their bait plan into action, drawing out as much of the MECHArbiter's power as possible while luring it inside the center of where the Kingdom of God will appear.<br>
If all goes well, the barrier will be firing on all pistons to counter against META corrosion. That will be the opportune time to annihilate it.<br>
Marco Polo finishes the ritual, locks the enemy in place, and unleashes all conceptual power at once to deal a devastating blow.<br>
This plan is their best shot at victory.<br>
Hierophant, relay this plan to her.<br>
<br>
At the same time, inside the Sardegnia League's new joint headquarters on Sardegnia Island, Andrea was having familiar apprehensions.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Andrea Doria META：</span><br>
So, the killing-blow part of this plan... Isn't it a bit crude?<br>
What if, for example, all our combined strength still isn't enough to beat God's weapon?<br>
I know there's very little intel on our enemy, but we should be prepared for the worst-case scenario.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
Yes, I understand your concern, just... hold on. I'll ask for a revelation.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Trento META：</span><br>
Ask for one? Do revelations really come simply when you ask for them?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Giulio Cesare META：</span><br>
Heh. Interesting.<br>
<br>
Ignoring the doubtful looks around her, Marco Polo closed her eyes, opening them again just a short while later.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
I've got it!<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Andrea Doria META：</span><br>
That was quick. Did your God tell you anything?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
God hath spoken – we shall quench it!<br>
We'll exploit a property of the Siren's barrier and pummel it with attacks of two opposing natures within a short span. This will allow us to break through the limits of its defense.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Andrea Doria META：</span><br>
Um... What?<br>
Is... Is that the revelation you received?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
Well, yes? The figure in my vision said so. Are you doubting me?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Andrea Doria META：</span><br>
This "God" of yours sure is something else...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
Heheh. Right? I couldn't agree more!<br>
Now that we have a plan, we just have to iron out the details!<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=Final Battle - Part 1|选项=27|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<br>
Once the plan was set in stone, the shipgirls all sprung into action.<br>
In the truest sense, the Sardegnia League had united as one for the first time ever. They had become something worthy of the title of "league."<br>
HQ issued orders one after the next while the shipgirls intercepted the three separate fleets of Sirens.<br>
What's more, the core node hosting the Domain of Eternal Night on the island was very clearly signaling an intention to destroy Rome.<br>
This borderline provocation naturally drew the attention and fire of the Sirens' defense system.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">MECHArbiter: The Chariot VII：</span><br>
The three Siren fleets were dead in their tracks, but then, a fourth one suddenly emerged right in the middle of the sea. A figure matching the description of the MECHArbiter was clearly visible in their midst.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Giosuè Carducci：</span><br>
According to Her Grace, several fleets of so-called "mass-produced" ships and "Enforcers" have appeared.<br>
The Genoan Republic's and the Dukedom of Milan's fleets are keeping the first Siren fleet in check, while the Republic of Venice's and the Sardegnia Ecclesia's fleets are tackling the second one.<br>
As for the third fleet, the Kingdom of Sicily's fleet is implementing its plan to grind them to a halt.<br>
Each of our fleets is doing its utmost to stop the enemy's advance and isolate the fourth fleet of Sirens.<br>
While they do that, our forces will be the key to destroying the MECHArbiter's fleet.<br>
The enemy in question is on a straight course toward Sardegnia Island. We will be within its range in approximately 30 minutes.<br>
The Republic of Florence will take care of its mass-produced ships. The Enforcers will be dealt with by our mixed fleet that hasn't yet participated in battle.<br>
As part of our "quenching" tactic, we cannot expect assistance in the form of the Mechanicus Harbingers or the strength amplifier in the Lattice of God's Light.<br>
The only assistance we can expect is aerial support from da Vinci's and Alfredo's fleet of airships.<br>
Finally, Her Grace is performing the ritual and setting up the bait and extermination parts of our plan...<br>
...Which means that you are the only ones who can handle the MECHArbiter.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Bolzano META：</span><br>
I am a knight of the Sardegnia League and I will perform my duty no matter what.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Andrea Doria META：</span><br>
It's us against God's most powerful weapon...<br>
I pictured countless ways that this war could end. I would not in a thousand years have guessed this is how it would end.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Trento META：</span><br>
Every state in the League coming together in unity in pursuit of victory... It's a wonderful thing to see.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Andrea Doria META：</span><br>
Agreed. It's the best thing I could've ever hoped for.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Giulio Cesare META：</span><br>
Only if we win will it be so, Andrea.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Andrea Doria META：</span><br>
Yes, that is true...<br>
Our final opponent stands before us. So does the hope we've fostered for so long.<br>
We will break free of our cage, whatever the cost may be!<br>
<br>
<br>
KABOOOM!<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Bolzano META：</span><br>
As Trento said, our attacks really are ineffective.<br>
If nothing changes soon, they'll be threatening the core node within an hour.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Giosuè Carducci：</span><br>
Andrea, Her Grace just informed me that the ritual has been set up!<br>
The enemy is already within strike range, so the Kingdom of God can be deployed at any time.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Andrea Doria META：</span><br>
It's too soon. Too many nodes aren't connected yet. The Domain hasn't even reached half of its predicted output.<br>
We need more to put sufficient pressure on the enemy.<br>
Keep capturing nodes and raising the Banner of Eternal Night.<br>
Meanwhile, I suppose... it's time to carry out the backup plan.<br>
Overclock the laboratory's system and push the META corrosion up to a new threshold!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Giosuè Carducci：</span><br>
Are you sure that's a good idea?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Andrea Doria META：</span><br>
I'm sure. We've always been ready for this if it's what it takes to break free of our cage.<br>
It's nothing too serious. It will just give us more strength at the cost of our health.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Giosuè Carducci：</span><br>
That's definitely not all it does, based on Her Grace's reaction to your plan...<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Giulio Cesare META：</span><br>
Hmph. I always have wanted to break past that meaningless safety protocol.<br>
I'm on it.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Andrea Doria META：</span><br>
Carducci, don't flip the extermination switch just yet. Stick to the plan and focus on expanding the Domain.<br>
We only have one shot at this, so remember...<br>
No matter how hard the fighting gets, don't relent until you're given the signal.<br>
<br>
<br>
KABOOOM!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bartolomeo Colleoni：</span><br>
Andrea, I am presently engaging the Enforcers.<br>
Their strength is so far beyond expectations that a quick fight is out of the question. I'll do all I can to hold them back.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Andrea Doria META：</span><br>
Understood.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
Things are going super well for our airship fleet, luckily!<br>
Doesn't look like the enemy's equipped to deal with aerial attacks, so we've already reduced their mass-produced fleet to scraps!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
Heck, we kinda have forces to spare, so how about we send some your way?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Andrea Doria META：</span><br>
No, let's stick to the plan.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
You're the boss.<br>
<br>
KABOOOM!<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Trento META：</span><br>
Andrea! Our attacks aren't getting through! In fact, the Domain of Eternal Night isn't having any observable effect on them!<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Andrea Doria META：</span><br>
Then we don't have enough output. Carducci, we have to capture every node as soon as possible!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Giosuè Carducci：</span><br>
We're engaged on all fronts, but I'll try to hurry things along.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Giulio Cesare META：</span><br>
Is it time to employ our backup plan?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Andrea Doria META：</span><br>
Not yet. Launch one more offensive.<br>

<br>
Amidst ceaseless explosions, the great beast of condensed red and black fog launched a relentless attack on the prey trapped within it.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">MECHArbiter: The Chariot VII：</span><br>
ROOOAAAR!<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Andrea Doria META：</span><br>
Marco Polo!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
Once again! Commencing the final quenching stage of the plan!<br>
Carducci, send out the following commands to every node: Immediately remove the Banner of the Eternal Night and restart the Lattice of God's Light!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Giosuè Carducci：</span><br>
As you command!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
Raffaello, send the Mechanicus Harbingers to the front!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Raffaello：</span><br>
Oh yeah! Let's wreck some stuff! Go and give them hell, my masterworks!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
And Baracca – lead the Holy See Guard Fleet into battle!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Maggiore Baracca：</span><br>
I've been waiting for this. We're ready to go!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
Magnificent! And finally...<br>
O God! Give me your strength and bring to us your kingdom!<br>
<br>
<br>
KABOOOM!<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">MECHArbiter: The Chariot VII：</span><br>
ROOOAAAR!<br>
<br>
Shrouded in thick fog, the huge machine was firing in all directions, not a single blind spot out of range of its cannons.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Giosuè Carducci：</span><br>
Andrea, 90% of all the nodes have been captured now.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Andrea Doria META：</span><br>
Then we should be good. Overclock the system and encase the enemy completely in the Domain of Eternal Night!<br>
<br>
The fog thickened, and streaks of blood-red light rushed through it.<br>
It was like the Domain of Eternal Night had converged into a single entity – like a giant had risen from its slumber.<br>
Andrea's group coordinated so closely that it was almost like they were an extension of this giant.<br>
KABOOOM!<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">MECHArbiter: The Chariot VII：</span><br>
ROOOOAAAAAR!<br>
<br>
Cannons covered in fog struck the MECHArbiter's sturdy barrier as blinding beams of light burst forth.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Trento META：</span><br>
Andrea, the enemy's attacks are getting duller and its barrier is growing darker!<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Giulio Cesare META：</span><br>
Looks like it worked.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Andrea Doria META：</span><br>
The moment has finally come... Marco Polo!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
I know! Commencing the final step of the plan now!<br>
O God, I call for you! Manifest your heavenly kingdom upon this earth!<br>
...What?!<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Andrea Doria META：</span><br>
It doesn't seem like anything happened... Did the ritual work?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
...God just told me to "hang on a minute"!<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Andrea Doria META：</span><br>
Did I hear that right? God wants you to wait?<br>
Seems we have no other choice... I'll use the final card in our hand.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
What are you talking about?! The cursed thing's barrier is completely attuned to your attacks!<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Andrea Doria META：</span><br>
I'll destroy all our equipment. The core node, the laboratory, and everything else on Sardegnia Island.<br>
They contain a tremendous source of energy. Destroying them all at the same time will generate a massive shock wave.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
What consequences will that have?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Andrea Doria META：</span><br>
It won't be possible to rebuild the laboratory. No new METAs will come to be if we destroy all that machinery.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
No more METAs? An acceptable price to pay. We don't NEED them.<br>
Can you ensure the safety of your comrades, though?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Andrea Doria META：</span><br>
No need to worry about that.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
Magnificent! Do it, then!<br>
<br>
In the endless white expanse, I witnessed all of the shipgirls' conversations and the changes in the battle through the eyes of the statue.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
An energy source that creates METAs... Is she talking about a special Wisdom Cube? Origin Cubes, to be specific?<br>
They're not seriously considering detonating them, are they?!<br>
<br>
The image of a black tornado destroying everything in its path flashes in my mind.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Hierophant, you have to stop them! Nobody will be able to withstand the damage if those Cubes go off!<br>
<br>
In response to my plea, another door appears not far from me.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
...What does that mean? That the plan will work out just fine?<br>
What are you trying to tell me?<br>
<br>
I reach out to touch it, and everything changes abruptly.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Colette：</span><br>
Well, Dr. Aoste, my experiment was a success.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dr. Aoste：</span><br>
You discovered a way to blow up Energy Cubes, you mean?<br>
<br>
I see Dr. Aoste and Colette conversing inside a strangely familiar laboratory.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Colette：</span><br>
Hey, it's a serious research project. Don't paint me like some kid experimenting with firecrackers.<br>
My peers can be as biased against it as they want, but I still believe the explosive-propulsion engine is a promising subject.<br>
It was widely believed that it was impossible for E-Cubes to release an explosion of energy in a short time, despite the enormous amount of energy they contain.<br>
And yet, Wisdom Cubes – particularly ones that have undergone METAmorphosis – are reliably able to cause a destructive shock wave in response to stimulus.<br>
And what's true for Wisdom Cubes is true for Energy Cubes as well.<br>
If a Wisdom Cube can undergo METAmorphosis, there's no reason why E-Cubes shouldn't be able to in theory.<br>
Isn't it natural, then, to change our way of thinking and try to work out how METAmorphosis works for Energy Cubes?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dr. Aoste：</span><br>
"In theory" is not the same as "in practice." Energy Cubes are far more stable than Wisdom Cubes. How on earth did you make it turn META?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Colette：</span><br>
Sorry, OXS trade secret. If you want to use our technique, we can discuss a business contract later.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dr. Aoste：</span><br>
No, see, what I'm concerned about is the safety.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Colette：</span><br>
Talk about being a worrywart. Do you remember that Wisdom Cube power output monitor and limiter you showed me before?<br>
My team used that as a template for our own version made for META Energy Cubes. I've named it the M-type limiter – subject to change.<br>
A META Energy Cube with the limiter installed exhibits completely different behaviors based on whether the desired output exceeds the value needed for an explosion or not.<br>
If it's below the value, the limiter ensures not a single iota of energy will be released, preventing the expression of its META characteristics. Basically, it's just a brick then.<br>
But, if the value exceeds the detonation threshold... Kaboom.<br>
The limiter is immediately disabled, and the violent energy surge is then released as a shock wave.<br>
Since this simultaneously destroys the Cube's casing, there's also zero risk of a secondary hazard.<br>
Come to think of it, I haven't come up with a name for these unique E-Cubes yet.<br>
META Energy Cube... MEC for short. Actually, how about M-Type Energy Cube? M-TEC.<br>
<br>
The statue's eyes stare back at me inside the endless white space.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
An Energy Cube with META properties...<br>
Not just that – a Cube that can be detonated...<br>
...That's what they are?!<br>

<br>
KABOOM!<br>
With Marco Polo commanding from atop her throne, the offense struck like an unstoppable tsunami.<br>
The MECHArbiter's barrier was completely destroyed after a coordinated volley, so the shipgirls mercilessly bombarded its exposed armor with their cannons.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">MECHArbiter: The Chariot VII：</span><br>
ROOOOAAAAR!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
Phew... We've finally broken through that stupidly thick barrier!<br>
Now to pierce the armor. Continue the attack! Strip away everything it has!<br>
<br>
In the endless expanse of white, I watch as the barrier disintegrates through the statue's eyes.<br>
<span style="color:#bdbdbd;">▅H▊▇ro▅■ph▇▆▅：</span><br>
…………<br>
<br>
A strange light flashes in the statue's eyes.<br>
Then, the next moment, it and I are both sucked into a vortex that appeared out of nowhere.<br>
<br>
<br>
KABOOOM!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Maggiore Baracca：</span><br>
The Holy See Guard Fleet has arrived!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Giosuè Carducci：</span><br>
Reinforcements, Your Grace.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
Excellent timing! Are the nodes done being changed?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Giosuè Carducci：</span><br>
About half of all nodes suffered damage that cannot be repaired. Besides those, all others have been converted and connected to the Lattice of God's Light.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
Magnificent! I'll give you a small boost before you go in.<br>
There! Now go! Crush them until there's nothing left!<br>
<br>
<br>
KABOOOM!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Raffaello：</span><br>
Marco Polo! I'm in position!<br>
Holy moly! The fighting here is so intense!<br>
This is the Kingdom of God... And that's the Army of God...<br>
This is such good inspo! I've gotta draw this right now!<br>
Ahem. Mechanicus Harbingers, go forth!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
Save your drawing for AFTER we've won!<br>
<br>
<br>
Thus, the red and black fog that embodied the Eternal Night vanished in an instant.<br>
The world lit up with the light of faith, and a sacred silence filled the air from horizon to horizon.<br>
In the midst of the pure white, the chorus resounded.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
"I am Marco Polo, the Apostle."<br>
<span style="color:#bdbdbd;">The Chorus：</span><br>

<br>
？？？·？？？<br>
???<br>
When my vision returns to me, I find myself looking at...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
...A Siren mainframe?<br>
<br>
Beneath a false sky and a hollow sea, the city of steel towers silently.<br>
<span style="color:#bdbdbd;">▅H▊▇ro▅■ph▇▆▅：</span><br>
…………<br>
<br>
The statue still won't say a word, but it does envelop me in pure white and carry me through the city.<br>
We pass a nameless street, cross through a plaza, and snake through an alleyway before finally arriving at the colossal tower in the center.<br>
Still encased in the whiteness, I'm escorted up several stories of the structure.<br>
Then, we stop inside a hall.<br>
There, a hologram of MECHArbiter: The Chariot VII stands silently.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">MECHArbiter: The Chariot VII：</span><br>
…………<br>
<br>
At the same time, I realize that there is a panel hosting hundreds of buttons not far from the hologram.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Oh my god... Is that the panel for the security system that Chariot created?<br>
<br>
I approach to get a closer look. The buttons are labeled 1 through 255, and the panel looks almost antiquated compared to its surroundings. It stands out.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
...Yep, this is it.<br>
These 255 buttons must be the sub-options for the security system that Chariot said she installed.<br>
And beyond those...<br>
<br>
Next to all these smaller buttons, in a clearly sectioned-off area, there sits a single big, red button.<br>
Looking closely, I can see small writing under it: "Security system emergency shutdown button. Do not press outside of emergencies."<br>
<span style="color:#bdbdbd;">▅H▊▇ro▅■ph▇▆▅：</span><br>
…………<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
While they did manage to strip the MECHArbiter of its barrier, that alone won't be enough to defeat it.<br>
To do that, it has to be weakened sufficiently for you to interfere with it.<br>
Basically, if I understand correctly... you want me to push this button, right?<br>
<span style="color:#bdbdbd;">▅H▊▇ro▅■ph▇▆▅：</span><br>
…………<br>
<br>
Despite not receiving an answer, I can intuit what the statue wants.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：(Push the emergency shutdown button.)</span>'''''<br>
<br>
The lights in the hall go out one by one, and the hologram of the MECHArbiter also gradually grows fainter before disappearing altogether.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Phew... That should do it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Communicator：</span><br>
BEEP BEEP!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
...My communicator is ringing?<br>
<br>
Despite me not pressing the answer button on it, my communicator keeps ringing for a while, then automatically connects.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">？？？？：</span><br>
Huh? Why did you push that button?<br>
What did you screw up this time, Hierophant?<br>
<span style="color:#bdbdbd;">▅H▊▇ro▅■ph▇▆▅：</span><br>
…………、、、<br>
<br>
A dizzying wave washes over me, painting everything a pure white color again.<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=Epilogue|选项=31|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<br>
Unknown location<br>
Unknown time<br>
In the endless expanse of white, the statue and I stare at one another.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
That caller... It was Hierophant herself, wasn't it?<br>
<span style="color:#bdbdbd;">▅H▊▇ro▅■ph▇▆▅：</span><br>
…………、、、<br>
<br>
The statue is as silent as it has been the whole time, and yet, it looks as though there's a little more life inside it.<br>
Right as that thought forms, the white space collapses in but the blink of an eye.<br>
Meanwhile, the Sardegnians were celebrating with vigor.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Raffaello：</span><br>
We did it!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
We did it!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo & Raffaello：</span><br>
We won!<br>
<br>
They stood in front of the wreckage of the MECHArbiter. Everyone was cheering, hooting, and hollering.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
Target has been completely destroyed! Mission complete!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Maggiore Baracca：</span><br>
I can't believe the barrier was that strong, but it was so squishy underneath...<br>
Heheh. Guess it was a paper tiger after all.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Giosuè Carducci：</span><br>
It was nerve-racking, but we succeeded in the end.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
We actually won? I'm not dreaming here, am I?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Giosuè Carducci：</span><br>
You aren't. I'm hearing good news from all over the League. All other Siren forces fell silent practically the moment that the MECHArbiter was defeated. Victory is undoubtedly ours.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Andrea Doria META：</span><br>
The cage has been broken... We've finally done it.<br>
From now on, we can race across the sea free and unrestrained...<br>
By the way, Marco Polo... What will you do with the Kingdom of God?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
Put your concerns to rest. Now that the threat has passed, it's obvious what I'm going to do with it.<br>
The aftermath and changes to come after this battle can be discussed once we've had our celebration.<br>
Now that the string-pullers of the world's fate have been defeated, I'm sure just by talking it out, we can always reach an agreement that sits right with everyone!<br>
But before that, let's discuss the details of my grand celebratory–<br>
<br>
Marco Polo suddenly stopped mid-sentence, and a puzzling light flashed in her eyes.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Giosuè Carducci：</span><br>
Your Grace?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
Sorry. The plan has changed.<br>
God is calling for me, so it's up to you to discuss the celebratory banquet among yourselves!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Raffaello：</span><br>
What?! Are you serious?!<br>
*sob*... You'll always be our one and only Apostle, Your Grace! Forever!<br>
I'll create a masterpiece for us all to remember you by!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
Enough with the histrionics!<br>
Sure, I said that like I'm going to perish, but that is not the case!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Raffaello：</span><br>
Huh? You didn't mean you're giving up the ghost?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
Obviously not! Cast your mind back to my anointment ceremony. You do remember that I said I'm not from this world, yes?<br>
I'm simply going back whence I came!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Raffaello：</span><br>
Oohhh. So you weren't joking about that?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
Of course I wasn't!<br>
There, I clarified – now stop making that face at me. It's not like I'm never coming back.<br>
You better paint that masterpiece for me. I want to see it one day.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Raffaello：</span><br>
Yeah! I promise I will!<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Andrea Doria META：</span><br>
I never expected that our farewell would come this abruptly.<br>
You came to us so suddenly and now you leave equally suddenly... like a gust of wind. Heehee.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
Sorry, that's just how I operate!<br>
Now, then, I entrust the aftermath to you.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Andrea Doria META：</span><br>
Don't worry, it's in safe hands. We will work with the Ecclesia and restore order to the Sardegnia League.<br>
And then, we will move toward a free and beautiful future together.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
I look forward to seeing that.<br>
Now... It's time for me to leave.<br>
<br>
With a slightly pained look in her eyes, Marco Polo bid farewell to her friends.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
Until we meet again.<br>
<br>
Marco Polo closed her eyes and silently lay down in the water.<br>
A fading light illuminated her face, calm and serene, like she was dreaming a wonderful dream.<br>
From up on high, she silently gazed down on herself, sleeping soundly and surrounded by everyone she knew.<br>
A smile formed on her lips, then she finally turned around and left.<br>
Although Marco Polo the shipgirl may have left the Sardegnia League, Marco Polo the Apostle will forever be with them.<br>

Inside NA Ocean Central Singularity<br>
Tribunal Special Fleet<br>
Cabin below deck<br>
The next thing I knew, I'd returned to the very moment when I was going to open the door to Marco Polo's cabin.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Am I... Am I back?<br>
What time is–<br>
<br>
The second hand on my pocket watch has only advanced a handful of ticks.<br>
Just a short distance away, Miss Hat – Marco Polo – is still in a deep sleep.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Still sleeping, huh...<br>
Safe to assume the bond between her and Hierophant grew deeper after all of this. Only time will tell whether that's for better or for worse...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Communicator：</span><br>
BEEP BEEP!<br>
<span style="color:#c3abff;">Kasumi META：</span><br>
Commander, have you finished logging that entry?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Yeah. I'm done. Miss Hat is still asleep. I'll hand her over to you.<br>
<span style="color:#c3abff;">Kasumi META：</span><br>
Roger. We'll go there now.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Oh, could you pass on a word to Helena for me?<br>
Tell her to call me as soon as this business is done with, and that I have something important to discuss with her.<br>
<span style="color:#c3abff;">Kasumi META：</span><br>
Will do.<br>
<span style="color:#c3abff;">Vestal META：</span><br>
There is no knowing what may happen inside the Singularity, Commander. Please return as quickly as possible.<br>

Unknown location<br>
Unknown time<br>
An endless stretch of pure white. A space where time and space were meaningless. It was through here that Marco Polo wandered.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
Ugh... This is horrible!<br>
Wherever I look, it's all the same... How am I supposed to find my way home?<br>
I'm exhausted... I miss my Apostle's throne.<br>
<br>
She muttered to herself, then sat down on a throne.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
……？！！<br>
You know, I think I'd like a more lavish throne!<br>
<br>
She muttered again, and this time, sat down on a throne more lavish than the last.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
Wh-what in the world?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Raffaello：</span><br>
Whoooa! That's a real lavish throne you got, Marco!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
Raffaello?! What are you doing here?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Raffaello：</span><br>
Uhh... I had too much to drink at the banquet, so I just...<br>
What is this place, anyway?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
Hmm...<br>
An excellent question...<br>
I haven't the faintest clue!<br>

Iris Orthodoxy - Capital<br>
Commander's office<br>
Several days later<br>
Several days have passed since the incident, and my life is fully back to the usual.<br>
I told Helena about my run-in with Hierophant and said I wanted to run some tests, but she didn't get back to me about that.<br>
As for our plans to deal with what Sirens linger in the world, each of them is progressing steadily.<br>
The one closest to completion is our plan to clean up the NA Ocean. It's comparatively easy work since it's the area where Compiler fell.<br>
It will be led jointly by the Royal Navy, Iris Orthodoxy, Iron Blood, and Northern Parliament.<br>
KNOCK KNOCK!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Commander, Bismarck has extended an invitation to you. She wants you to attend a diplomatic dinner tomorrow.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
An invitation from Bismarck? Those don't come every day.<br>
Hm? Hang on a second...<br>
<br>
I accept the invitation. An emblem on the front, consisting of windmills and tulips, catches my attention.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
The Kingdom of Tulipa...<br>
(I see... That's why Bismarck is taking the initiative.)<br>
(What are we going to discuss? That Lower Countries Treaty that they're drafting in Europa?)<br>
(Or maybe it will be about Tulipan shipgirls?)<br>
(Either way, color me intrigued.)<br>
Tell her that I'll absolutely be there.<br>
In fact, I want you to come with me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Really? Sure!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
There may be a lot of work we'll have to discuss.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Oh... Naturally.<br>

In an endless sea of stars, a long-lasting pursuit was finally about to reach its end.<br>
KABOOOM!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Miss D：</span><br>
Thief! Thief! Thiiieeef!<br>
Gimme back my whale!<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Sheffield META：</span><br>
A stubborn pest, this one... Regardless, her end is near.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
Keep it up! She's at her limit, so hit her harder!<br>
<br>
KABOOOM!<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">Arbiter: The Devil XV：</span><br>
Gah... You don't give up, huh?<br>
Well, I got some good data, so if you want it so badly, fine!<br>
Just know that I'm letting you have this! You didn't beat me!<br>
I'll be back for round two!<br>
<br>
KABOOOM!<br>
Devil's vessel was blown to bits in a plume of fire. Just like that, the battle was over at last.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Miss D：</span><br>
Heehee!<br>
Whale, whale, whale! My whale is finally back!<br>
Thanks for the help, Sheffield!<br>
If you hadn't come, who knows how much longer we would've had to chase her around!<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Sheffield META：</span><br>
My arrival was but a coincidence and I thought I should assist. You need not sing my praises.<br>
It should be Her Majesty's determination and tenacity that you thank for this victory.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Miss D：</span><br>
Good point. Thanks, Elizabeth!<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
Save your thanks for later. Now that your whale is back, do you sense anything different?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Miss D：</span><br>
Hmm...<br>
Hmmmmm...<br>
Maybe...<br>
Guh...<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
What is it?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Miss D：</span><br>
I forgot...<br>
I can't remember how I'm supposed to use the whale!<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
You bloody what?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Miss D：</span><br>
Do YOU know how to use it?!<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
…………………………<br>
Well... We have at least secured the whale now. Sooner or later, its method of usage becomes clear!<br>
Since most of test site beta's new coordinates have been calculated, a more detailed inspection will have to wait until we get back home!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Miss D：</span><br>
Awww... Fine...<br>
Wait, how do we bring the whale back?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
By packing it up. Worry not, the Queen's Light will have no trouble fitting a single whale!<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Sheffield META：</span><br>
...Your Majesty, something doesn't feel quite right.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
Yes, you're right... Something tiresome is coming our way.<br>
Blast it... We should have recovered the train cars before departure.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Miss D：</span><br>
What's wrong, Elizabeth?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
Trouble is coming, that's what.<br>
Once you and Sheffield have retrieved the whale, stay inside the train.<br>
...We shall deal with this trouble ourselves.<br>

<br>
The blinding light fades, and I find myself inside a well-lit classroom.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(This place again... Did Madam M summon me again?)<br>
(Of course this happens right when Helena is looking for me all over out there.)<br>
<br>
I look out the window. The weather is as calm as can be, with a gentle breeze blowing and sunshine pouring in.<br>
Inside the classroom, however...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
...Where is Madam M?<br>
And why the heck did she bring me here?<br>
<br>
I take a walk around the classroom. I move some chairs and desks and knock on the podium, but still, Madam M is nowhere to be seen.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Weird...<br>
<br>
Gathering my courage, I grip the door to slide it aside and take a look outside, but right then...<br>
KNOCK KNOCK!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">???：</span><br>
Um, hello...<br>
I was told my classes will be held here today...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
……？！！！<br>
<br>
The person who knocked is someone I've seen before.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bon Homme Richard Movie Ad：</span><br>
Hey, everyone! It's me, Bon Homme Richard. The Final Countdown is in theaters now!<br>
I had a lot of fun in the starring role. Be sure to check it out!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Deep-Voiced Narrator：</span><br>
Welcome to the paradox of time, where past and present become one and history is actually changed! The Final Countdown... now in a theater near you.<br>
Buy a ticket today and you have the chance to win a three-day guided tour of...<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Repulse META ：</span><br>
That voice, that tornado... Is that Bon Homme Richard?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Renown META ：</span><br>
There's no mistaking it! But how did she get here?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Bon Homme Richard? Who is she?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Renown META ：</span><br>
She's a shipgirl from our branch, and the only person in existence that the head of Antiochus – Zero – cannot write into her mainframe.<br>
Even with the endless information from the past Zero has access to, she cannot reconstruct Richard.<br>
Moreover, Richard has never been seen in any other branch as far as we know.<br>
This is the first time we've laid eyes on her since her namesake incident.<br>
Is she after you? Why?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
You...<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Who are you?!</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：Bon Homme Richard?!</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项3：Miss Richard?!</span>'''''<br>
<br>
All of a sudden, everything rapidly breaks down before my eyes.<br>
Right before I completely black out, it looks as though there's a momentary hint of confusion in Bon Homme Richard's eyes.<br>
The night is silent. I'm in bed. The ceiling greets me.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
What... What was that?<br>
Was it just... a dream?<br>
