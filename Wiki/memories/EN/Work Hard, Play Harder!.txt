Work Hard, Play Harder!<br>
<br>
1 A Sunny Afternoon<br>
One afternoon at the office...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Avrora：</span><br>
Commander, I've finished going through all the documents. There's just one problem...<br>
Every Northern Parliament exercise participant was supposed to turn in a report, but we're still missing one.<br>
<br>
Avrora looks a bit annoyed. I wonder if she knows whose report is missing.<br>
Suddenly, I hear the sound of boots clopping down the hallway. Soon, a dark-haired girl wearing a Northern Parliament uniform throws the doors of the office open.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pamiat Merkuria：</span><br>
*yaaawn*... Yoohoo, Commander!<br>
<br>
It's Pamiat' Merkuria... with dark circles under her eyes.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："Full of energy as always, I see."</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2："Hey. It's afternoon, if you didn't notice."</span>'''''<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''I'm only half sarcastic. She clearly has not gotten enough sleep, yet still acts as cheerful as ever.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pamiat Merkuria：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Wh-what? Of course I am! Are you concerned about me or something~?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pamiat Merkuria：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Hehehe~ Afternoon, schmaftersploon. All that matters is that I'm here!<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Besides, it's morning somewhere in the world even if it's afternoon here~<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''...Clearly, sleep deprivation was no match for her cheekiness.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pamiat Merkuria：</span><br>
Anyway, uh, I've come to drop off some paperwork.<br>
Let's see... Here are the records from the Northern Parliament's last battle, and here's the... Wait, where's the after-action report?<br>
Oh right, I left it right– Eek!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Avrora：</span><br>
Oh no!<br>
<br>
After finding her paperwork, Pamiat' tries to do a triumphant twirl but immediately loses her balance. Fortunately, Avrora is there to catch her.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pamiat Merkuria：</span><br>
Phew, that was close! Thanks for the hand, Avrora. Anyway, I'll leave the stuff on your desk, Commander, so don't forget to look it over. I'm gonna head back to the dorm now!<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："Do you need someone to escort you?"</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pamiat Merkuria：</span><br>
Hehehe~ I'll be just fine! See ya later! ...Owww, my back...<br>
<br>
The way she was clutching her back as she tottered out the door makes me consider sending someone to accompany her anyway...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Avrora：</span><br>
She has always been like that. I'm more concerned about her unhealthy lifestyle though.<br>
She got hooked on a new video game she bought the other day, and has been so absorbed in it that she hasn't been keeping up with work...<br>
I believe it's what they call "going goblin mode."<br>
If you think it's warranted, should we go check on her?<br>
<br>
It definitely isn't a good idea to leave her to her own devices forever, but I also don't want to bother her if she went back to sleep.<br>
Maybe I'll pay her a visit after dinner.<br>

<br>
2 A Lifestyle In Need of Correction<br>
Northern Parliament Dormitory - After dinner<br>
If I remember properly, this is where her room should be...<br>
*knock* *knock*<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">???：</span><br>
Come in! The door's unlocked!<br>
<br>
I open her door, and immediately feel like I'm stepping into a warzone. Candy bar wrappers and empty bottles of soda are strewn all over the place, and her shelves look like they haven't been organized in ages.<br>
Pamiat' is sitting there on a big Manjuu cushion, gaming away without a care in the world.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pamiat Merkuria：</span><br>
Oh hey, Commander! Evenin'!<br>
<br>
"...At least you still have some perception of time."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pamiat Merkuria：</span><br>
Well yeah, duh. It's dark outside!<br>
Hey, you wanna play some co-op? This game came out just last week and it's amaaazing~<br>
Wait, hold up, what are you doing?!<br>
Nuooooh! I'm gonna die! Commander, waaaait!<br>
<br>
The speakers play a meaty, stabbing sound.<br>
After an alarmingly realistic cutscene, the phrase "YOU DIED" appears in big red letters on the center of the screen.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pamiat Merkuria：</span><br>
I seriously just died to a random monster and it's all your fault, Commander!<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："Sorry, but you should take a break every now and then."</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pamiat Merkuria：</span><br>
Hmph. I AM taking breaks! What do you think I'm doing right now?<br>
There are a million ways to relax! Gaming is obviously one of them!<br>
As for getting enough sleep, that was just a one-off! I, I'll work on it! Hmph...<br>
<br>
Pamiat' being who she is, I know it takes more than a single lecture to get her to change her stubborn ways.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："One more thing: you'll be my new secretary."</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pamiat Merkuria：</span><br>
Whaaat?! Just like that?! You've already got Avrora filling that role!<br>
<br>
"Yes. We discussed swapping you in and she supports the idea."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pamiat Merkuria：</span><br>
While I'd love to work my butt off for you, I'd love it more if you worked YOUR butt off for me...<br>
Hmm, you know what?<br>
<br>
She shoves a game controller into my hands.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pamiat Merkuria：</span><br>
I'll do as you say! If you can beat me in a game, that is!<br>
Hehehe~ Don't expect me to go easy on you~<br>
<br>
Ten minutes later...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pamiat Merkuria：</span><br>
That doesn't count! You just got lucky! Come on, rematch! Best of three!<br>
Another ten minutes later, Pamiat' throws herself at her cushion in defeat. Whether out of resignation or rage, no one knows.<br>
Urgh... I was THIS close, too! This blows...<br>
<br>
What is clear to me is that she's not quite the gamer she makes herself out to be.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pamiat Merkuria：</span><br>
Ugh... Dasvidaniya, my easygoing life...<br>

<br>
3 First Day on the Job<br>
The sun's brilliant rays shine through the office windows.<br>
Today is supposed to be Pamiat's first day as my secretary. Noon has rolled around, but she is still nowhere to be seen.<br>
Hopefully nothing bad happened to her...<br>
I was just about to call Avrora when I hear the familiar sound of boots clopping down the hallway.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pamiat Merkuria：</span><br>
Yoohoo, Commander! Morning!<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："Good morning."</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2："It's afternoon, if you didn't notice. Again."</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pamiat Merkuria：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Hehehe~ I'll be your secretary starting today!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pamiat Merkuria：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Don't "again" me! It's not the end of the world!<br>
<br>
I'm starting to wonder if punctuality means nothing to this girl.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："You're late. Might I ask why?"</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pamiat Merkuria：</span><br>
Ahah! I knew it! You can't stop thinking about me after all, can you~?<br>
It's simple, actually~ I stayed up all night playing games so I overslept!<br>
<br>
"...At least try to make an excuse for yourself."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pamiat Merkuria：</span><br>
Why would I do that? You never said anything about a specific time I had to be in your office, so that's on you~<br>
You can lecture me if you want, but it won't change the facts! Might as well look on the bright side – now I'm here and ready to work!<br>
<br>
"Ugh. I was a fool for thinking you had run into trouble..."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pamiat Merkuria：</span><br>
Ahaha♪ In my defense, I had to do a ton of stuff to prepare for my new position.<br>
I promise I won't be late again! Go easy on me this one time and I'll make myself real useful from here on out!<br>
<br>
"..."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pamiat Merkuria：</span><br>
Great~ Let's start on this stack of documents then!<br>
Come on, don't just sit on your butt, Commander! We've both got work to do!<br>

<br>
4 A Surprising Performance<br>
A few days later...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pamiat Merkuria：</span><br>
Yoohoo, Commander!<br>
I've sorted your letters and left them over there. Go get 'em!<br>
And over here I have today's exercise papers and data, all categorized neatly!<br>
Lastly, there's the open sea exercise report. All you need to do is read through it and then sign off on it!<br>
And that's that. I've done pretty much everything you asked for. Way to go me, right?<br>
<br>
It's already been several days since Pamiat' became my secretary.<br>
Surprisingly, she picked up on the job real quick.<br>
As they say, never judge a book by its cover. There's a reason she has such a long and rich history.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pamiat Merkuria：</span><br>
Commaaaaandeeeeer!<br>
Hellooooo? I'm trying to talk to you here!<br>
<br>
I got lost in thought and the next thing I know, she's up in my face. Her hair smells faintly of lavender-scented shampoo.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pamiat Merkuria：</span><br>
Oh, forget it. Just know that I want some more of that "ramen" as a reward for my hard work! Take me to a restaurant once we're done today!<br>
<br>
At first, I tried to motivate her with rewards. While that did succeed, she's now taking full advantage of my miscalculation.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pamiat Merkuria：</span><br>
And of course – your treat, per usual, right? Hehehe~<br>
Now chop chop, Commander! There's still tons of work to be done!<br>

5 All Carrot, No Stick<br>
Some time later in the office...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pamiat Merkuria：</span><br>
Hehehe~ Another day's work done in a flash thanks to me!<br>
Oof, my shoulders feel so stiff all of a sudden... C'mere for a sec, Commander~♡<br>
<br>
Pamiat' reverts back into sloth mode the very moment she finishes all her tasks.<br>
Though, I don't really have any ground to criticize her. She has been a huge help, and normally doesn't act this spoiled.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pamiat Merkuria：</span><br>
Right here~ Yeah, that's the spot~ I need a massage here sooo badly♪<br>
<br>
She brazenly asks for her daily reward. This time, a massage. Because of her attitude, I decide to...<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Give her a good massage</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：Mess with her a little</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项3：Get some payback</span>'''''<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Being as gentle as one would be with a little baby, I put my hands on her slender shoulders and start massaging her gingerly.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pamiat Merkuria：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Come ooon, put some oomph into it! My shoulders are gonna need much more than that!<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Pay some respect to this little veteran and give 'em a good squeeze~<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''"As you wish, Ma'am."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pamiat Merkuria：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Oooh, that's the ticket~ They feel so much better already~ Thanks, Commander!<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Feeling around for the stiffest spots, I put my hands on her shoulders and dig my thumbs into her muscles with a bit of force.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pamiat Merkuria：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Hang on– Ow, ow, ow... Actually, this feels pretty good!<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''This is perfect! Not too hard, not too soft!<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Oooh, that hit the spot~ Appreciate it, Commander!<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项3）</span>'''''Wanting some catharsis, I put my hands on the cheeky brat's shoulders and start crushing the stiffness out of her.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pamiat Merkuria：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项3）</span>'''''Ow, oww, OWWWW!<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项3）</span>'''''You're going way too hard! This really hurts without my rigging! Owww! You're gonna break something!<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项3）</span>'''''...Wait, what? I think that did the trick! My shoulders feel a lot better!<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项3）</span>'''''Was that like, some miraculous acupressure? I didn't know you were trained in that, Commander!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pamiat Merkuria：</span><br>
My shoulders being THAT stiff is proof that I really busted my butt. In other words, I deserve a reward♪<br>
<br>
"Come again? I just gave you a massage."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pamiat Merkuria：</span><br>
Sure, that counts as something, but I worked so hard that I deserve something more! Let's not forget an additional reward for all my efforts up 'til today!<br>
<br>
"For the love of... What do you have in mind, then?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pamiat Merkuria：</span><br>
Dunno, I haven't decided yet! Give me until the weekend to think about it!<br>
Anyhow, I'm gonna call it a day! See you tomorrow!<br>
Hmm-hm-hmm-hmm♪<br>
<br>
Just like that, she excuses herself and leaves my office while humming a cheerful tune. I'm not sure exactly why, but I seem to be anticipating the weekend more than usual.<br>

6 Casual Closeness<br>
Later, on the day before our day off...<br>
I have a lot more work to get through than usual due to an overlap in exercise schedules.<br>
Though I have already gotten a lot done, the amount of paperwork pending my review and approval is staggering.<br>
How much, exactly? About half of my available desk space's worth.<br>
I recline in my chair and stretch my arms. Fatigue washes over me when I realize that my rest day would not come until tomorrow – so close, yet so far.<br>
Nevertheless, I have to keep chipping away. Just when I go to pick up my pen again, I feel something soft press down on my head.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pamiat Merkuria：</span><br>
You know, Commander, you should really practice what you preach about taking breaks~<br>
I'm gonna sit on your lap. Can't get any work done now, can you?<br>
...Don't give me that look. I'm tired too. All I'm doing is resting on you instead of a pillow. Nothing wrong with that, right?<br>
Oh, and I won't take no for an answer~♪<br>
<br>
Pamiat' is having none of my objections. She turns around and plops herself into my lap.<br>
Her long, smooth hair drapes down right in front of me. My chest and thighs, where she's resting against me, won't stop singing praises of her softness.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pamiat Merkuria：</span><br>
You're comfier than any high-end chair I've sat on. I seriously need to do this more often, hehe~♪<br>
Oh yeah, I haven't told you what I came up with for my reward yet, have I?<br>
Well, someone pressured Akashi into expanding the port's amusement park not long ago, and I wanna go check it out~<br>
Wanna go there tomorrow, just the two of us?<br>
Of course, it wouldn't be much of a reward if I had to pay for my own ticket. You'll cover it, won't you?<br>
<br>
She seems really keen on this idea. I feel as if I have no choice but to agree to her every whim until she's satisfied.<br>
"Alright. We'll go to the amusement park tomorrow."<br>

Later, at the amusement park...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pamiat Merkuria：</span><br>
Whoooa! They've got brand new attractions! I wanna go on that one, Commander!<br>
That looks sooo yummy! Come on, buy me some of that♪<br>
Ooh! They've got new games for sale! I've gotta buy some! Wait right here, Commander~<br>
Hey, that arcade game looks fun! I'm gonna try it out!<br>
<br>
For someone with a bad back, it's astonishing just how much energy she has. She just keeps going and going.<br>
She was unbeatable in the arcade area, too. It seemed I'd way underestimated her skill as a gamer.<br>
If she was this good all along... does that mean she threw the game back when I visited her room?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pamiat Merkuria：</span><br>
Look what I won, Commander! You can have it!<br>
<br>
She set a new record playing the park's strength games, so they gave her a prize.<br>
She tightly clutched her prize in her bosom before presenting it to me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pamiat Merkuria：</span><br>
Well? Pretty nice, isn't it?<br>
<br>
In her hands is a small snowglobe.<br>
Inside, a lone cabin sits within a vast snowscape. Pushing the button on the globe whips up a gentle snowfall.<br>
There's nothing elaborate about it, but it had clearly been made with attentiveness and care. And it is more than enough to convey Pamiat's hard work.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pamiat Merkuria：</span><br>
They gave me this for breaking a record! Am I the best or what~?<br>
Heheh! Tell me more about how great I am! Bow down for bonus points if you want!<br>
<br>
And so, our fun times at the amusement park continue...<br>
Before long, the sun had begun to set, painting the world in a golden light.<br>
Pamiat' skips along excitedly as we head back to the dorms.<br>
There is a certain rhythm to the sound of her boots cheerily tapping the ground.<br>
I trail behind her, carrying bags stuffed with about half of the things she bought and won at the amusement park.<br>
Speaking of the amusement park, Akashi shot me an interesting look as we left. I'm sure this visit was great business for her.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pamiat Merkuria：</span><br>
Hmm-hm-hmm-hmm♪<br>
<br>
It might've been my imagination, but I think Pamiat' just stole a glance at me...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pamiat Merkuria：</span><br>
Commander, I'm tireeed! Can we stop and take a break?<br>
<br>
Hand on her back and forcing a weary expression, she points to a nearby bench.<br>
Is this her way of being considerate? I suppose that's fine...<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："Okay, let's stop for a minute."</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2："Bear with it. We're most of the way there."</span>'''''<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''I sit down on the bench. She huddles up right next to me, resting her head on my shoulder in a sweet manner.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pamiat Merkuria：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Hehehe~ You know, today made me realize that being a secretary's not so bad!<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''You work hard on weekdays then get to play even harder on weekends!<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''As long as that stays true... I don't mind staying your secretary forever, to tell you the truth.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Just don't expect me to work for free, and don't make me do overtime♪<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Deal? Great~ Then I've got something to give you.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''That snowglobe was just a little token of appreciation for your hard work – what you're about to get is your reward for giving me a great time today.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Shh, don't argue, just close your eyes for a sec.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''She's awfully insistent about it, so I close my eyes just as asked.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''A moment later, I feel a warm, moist sensation brush up against my cheek.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pamiat Merkuria：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''There you go! That was your reward!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pamiat Merkuria：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''...Oh come on! Can't you take a hint?<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''I was gonna give you a reward, but I guess you don't want it~<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Since you're just so hopelessly dense, you leave me no choice but to punish you!<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Shh, don't argue, just close your eyes for a sec.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''She's awfully insistent about it, so I close my eyes just as asked.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pamiat Merkuria：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Umm... You'll have to lean forward just a bit!<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''There, that's perfect. Okay, get ready for your punishment~<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''A moment later, I feel a warm, moist sensation brush up against my cheek.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pamiat Merkuria：</span><br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pamiat Merkuria：</span><br>
That's that, now let's move on!<br>
Oh, one more thing – next time you visit me, gimme a call before you come in, 'kay~?<br>
