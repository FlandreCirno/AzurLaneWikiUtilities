<br>
1 Seeping In<br>
While the Royal Navy was aiding Iris Libre's recapture of the Basilica Isles, Iron Blood's research in the Tower of Midgard's Mirror Sea continued.<br>
Iron Blood Floating Fortress A1 – Office<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
Let's see here... A progress report on the Tower's upgrades...<br>
A maintenance report... and a list of materials needed for repairs...<br>
<br>
A girl with short, black hair was once again seated at her desk, reading through documents late into the night.<br>
This had become commonplace for her, and the reports scattered across the once neatly-organized desk told a clear story of her lapsing focus.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
Ugh... Can't concentrate at all...<br>
It was nothing more than a nonsensical dream... So why can't I stop thinking about that black sun...?<br>
Damnit, I can't get any work done like this.<br>
<br>
Ulrich tried hard to push those haunting visions out of her mind, staring intently at the words printed on the documents in front of her.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
No more idle thoughts, Ulrich. Good, it's working...<br>
Focus. These documents aren't going to read themselves–– ...What?<br>
...What the hell?!<br>
<br>
When she raised her eyes, she found that though she was still sitting at the same desk, the office had warped into a completely different scenery.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
There has to be a limit to these sick jokes... I might be sleep-deprived, but I'm nowhere near hallucination territory.<br>
Am I losing my marbles here, or is this some side-effect of these facilities?<br>
...Or, is someone trying to tell me something?<br>
Whoever you are, you sure are persistent. I'll give you that much.<br>
You keep showing me the same thing over and over again... so what are you trying to get at?<br>

Ulrich? Is everything alright?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
I'm...<br>
Oh, it's you, Strasser.<br>
Don't mind me. Out of curiosity, did you see that too?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Peter Strasser：</span><br>
See... what, exactly?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
...Nevermind, it's nothing. When did you get here?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Peter Strasser：</span><br>
Approximately three minutes ago.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
And for what reason?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Peter Strasser：</span><br>
...What do you mean? We're about to start today's experiments, so I'm here to bring you the report and test supplies per standard procedure.<br>
Are you sure you're alright, Ulrich?<br>
You were staring blankly at your documents without moving a muscle. Is there something wrong with the reports?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
No, don't worry about it. I guess I didn't sleep well last night.<br>
Anyway, you've got an experiment to run, so leave the report here and begin preparations.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Peter Strasser：</span><br>
Very well. I'll be on my way then.<br>
If you're feeling mentally fatigued, I'd recommend some light exercise. We have training areas here after all.<br>
Give it some thought, alright?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
...You're right. I'll consider it.<br>

2 Unrest<br>
Floating Fortress B7 - Training Area<br>
KABOOOM!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Training System：</span><br>
Gunnery drill complete. Tabulating final results.<br>
Your final results are: 6 hits, 3 near misses, and 1 miss.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
Tsk...<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Gneisenau META：</span><br>
Quite understandable. Cumbersome paperwork will only hinder your ability to fight.<br>
Perhaps you've spent too many long hours cooped up in an office.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
Duly noted, "Gneisenau."<br>
But shouldn't you practice what you preach? I've hardly seen you leave the lab ever since I brought you before Bismarck.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Gneisenau META：</span><br>
True. I suppose we both stand to benefit from that bit of advice.<br>
So, what brings you here? It's the last place I expected to find you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
What, am I a deuce in your cornflakes now?<br>
I just felt like moving my body a bit, and not deal with Strasser nagging me about my health.<br>
And you? You here to train too, or what?<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Gneisenau META：</span><br>
Oh, do you actually need to ask me? What happened to those powers of observation you're so known for?<br>
Sarcasm aside, I'm here to check on you. What's going on?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
Nothing. Just haven't been able to sleep well the past few days because of these damn nightmares.<br>
Give me a night or two of good rest and I'll be perfectly fine.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Gneisenau META：</span><br>
...A nightmare?<br>
What kind of nightmare?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
A black sun, floating high up in the sky. Ring any bells?<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Gneisenau META：</span><br>
...Can't say it does.<br>
But, the fact that you've been vividly dreaming of the same thing for a prolonged period of time is rather strange.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
You ever had that? A nightmare following you?<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Gneisenau META：</span><br>
More or less.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
What was it about?<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Gneisenau META：</span><br>
I'd rather not talk about it... Though, I can sympathize with what you're going through. Being followed by a nightmare is never a good thing.<br>
All I can say is... you'd best stay on your toes.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
Heh. I'd be a damn fool to ignore those words coming from the mouth of a META.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Gneisenau META：</span><br>
Good. As for your black sun, I'll let you know if anything comes up.<br>
In any case, I should head back. But, before that...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Training System：</span><br>
Orders received. Another gunnery drill will commence in three minutes.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Gneisenau META：</span><br>
I took the liberty of starting another round of drills for you.<br>
At your current performance level, you're sure to sink in a real battle.<br>
So, please keep at it––<br>

3 Snooping<br>
Floating Fortress A2 - Archives<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Man, today's lunch was incredible. Hmm-hm-hmm♪<br>
Oops, right, this is the archives... I need to be quiet.<br>
If anyone's here, sorry! I'll keep it down!<br>
<br>
Zuikaku looked around, but couldn't find anyone. It seemed she was alone.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Phew. I'm not in trouble.<br>
Guess the Iron Blood girls are still busy training.<br>
That being the case, it's time to get down to business!<br>
Let's see... The documents should be over by...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">???：</span><br>
Zzzzz...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
...Huh? Was that a snore?<br>
Aw crap, that means I'm NOT alone after all!<br>
<br>
She followed the snoring to its origin – a lone shipgirl, hunched over a table.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
Zzzzz...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Ulrich? Is that you?<br>
Why are you napping in here of all pla–<br>
Wait, what am I doing? I've no reason to wake her up!<br>
<br>
Ulrich was sleeping like a log, completely unaware of Zuikaku's presence.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Poor girl must've been working overtime.<br>
Between administering this place, working on the Tower's upgrades, and studying that Watatsumi sample, she's doing the work of like, three people combined.<br>
Better leave her be. She deserves her beauty sleep.<br>
<br>
Just as Zuikaku was going to step away, she caught a glance of the books Ulrich had been reading.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Huh. "The Interpreting of Dreams" and "Inevitable Apocalypse"...<br>
That's not all. "Aztec Myths" and "Gods of Rome," too.<br>
And lastly... "The Book of Dark Knowledge"?<br>
That's a pretty broad range of topics...<br>
Are these part of her research, or are they just a hobby thing?<br>
Actually, what's it to me? Her reading habits are none of my business.<br>
I just happened to cop a look at the titles, but still...<br>
At least they're not top-secret documents, so I shouldn't get in trouble... I hope.<br>
Whatever, I'll just pretend I didn't see anything! I've got other things to be doing now!<br>

4 Parting Ways<br>
Floating Fortress B3 - Pier<br>
The girls, having finished their training for the day, docked at the pier and had a lively chat.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Heinrich：</span><br>
Aww, are you really going back already?<br>
Isn't this way too soon? Eisen's looking sad!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Carabiniere：</span><br>
I'm afraid I must. Lady Littorio just sent me a message, urging me to return to the World Expo.<br>
I'm needed there to bolster their security detail, you see...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Heinrich：</span><br>
Come on, can't you stay at least for today?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Adalbert：</span><br>
She's got orders to follow, Heinrich. I know you'll miss her, but you've gotta let her go.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Heinrich：</span><br>
I know, I know, but we were gonna throw a party and everything!<br>
It'll be lonely without her, and we can't set the table in just five minutes!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Adalbert：</span><br>
How 'bout a compromise? You could find her a gift or something before she's gotta run.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Carabiniere：</span><br>
Please, there's no need! You've already spoiled me with your hospitality during this short stay.<br>
You needn't prepare any last-minute parties or gifts for me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Heinrich：</span><br>
Well, okay...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Peter Strasser：</span><br>
Carabiniere, have you gotten Ulrich's message yet?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Carabiniere：</span><br>
Yes! She told me about it directly.<br>
She seemed to be feeling rather unwell, however, when I spoke to her...<br>
Could you please check on her after I go?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Peter Strasser：</span><br>
Yes, she has been rather out of it for a while now...<br>
But don't worry about her. I've already urged her to rest and recover.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Carabiniere：</span><br>
Splendid. Now then, I should really be on my way!<br>
If you happen to stop by the Expo, please come see me so I may return the kindness you've shown me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Peter Strasser：</span><br>
Of course. Should our paths cross, we'll let you know.<br>
I've left the Fortress' evacuation route open for you. Safe travels.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Heinrich：</span><br>
See you! Eisen, wave goodbye to our friend!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Carabiniere：</span><br>
Farewell, ladies!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Heinrich：</span><br>
There she goes... *sigh*... This place just got a lot duller.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Peter Strasser：</span><br>
Did it? I beg to differ.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Heinrich：</span><br>
What makes you say that?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Peter Strasser：</span><br>
As long as you're around, it'll never be quiet here.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Heinrich：</span><br>
Wow, rude!<br>
...Oh, oh! Strasser, I just got a good idea!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Peter Strasser：</span><br>
Oh boy... What kind of idea?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Heinrich：</span><br>
Ulrich's feeling under the weather, yeah? I think a power-packed beverage might be what she needs!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Peter Strasser：</span><br>
Don't tell me YOU'RE going to make it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Heinrich：</span><br>
Well, duh! I'm open to suggestions, though.<br>
Any aspiring mixologists in our midst? C'mon, let's hear some ideas!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-1206：</span><br>
Me, me! I've got one!<br>
A double dose of carbonation! That's supposed to be like, super refreshing!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Heinrich：</span><br>
Not a bad start. I'll note it down. Anyone else?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z46：</span><br>
Using healthy fruits or vegetables. Perhaps her poor mood is caused by a nutritional deficiency?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Heinrich：</span><br>
Yeah, that makes sense. Noted.<br>
Any other ideas? You got anything, Strasser?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Peter Strasser：</span><br>
No. I'll pass.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Adalbert：</span><br>
Same.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Heinrich：</span><br>
Don't be scared! What's the worst that could happen?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Peter Strasser：</span><br>
Being scared has nothing to do with it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Adalbert：</span><br>
Same.<br>
If you wanna do this, you've gotta do it yourself. Good luck.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Heinrich：</span><br>
Awwwwww!<br>

<br>
5 Reflecting in the Silence<br>
Floating Fortress A1 - Sakura Empire Guest Area<br>
Even as late night set over the Fortress, the lights in Zuikaku's room remained lit.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Hmm. So to summarize Iron Blood's findings...<br>
One – decades ago, a meteorite crashed into a barren part of the Northern Parliament, causing a huge explosion.<br>
The meteorite fragments were recovered by the Sirens before they could be studied.<br>
A scarce few fragments, however, wound up at the bottom of the Arctic Ocean.<br>
Two – one day, in the Diadem of Light, the Watatsumi stone displayed an as-of-yet unexplained power.<br>
As a result, many of the Sakura Empire's remote islands were designated as "sacred sites" and sealed away with barriers.<br>
And, according to leading scientists on the mainland, the barrier-creating technology became this advanced at breakneck speed...<br>
Three – with the combined power of Wisdom Cubes and shipgirls, humanity successfully repelled the Sirens in the first great war.<br>
And, unbeknownst to everyone else, the Northern Parliament had been conducting research on the Arctic meteorite since even before the war.<br>
Meaning, this project had been devised before shipgirls came into existence.<br>
Additionally, the first shipgirl to participate in the project was the first-generation Avrora.<br>
Four – Iron Blood's unique Black Cube may have actually been an Origin Cube, obtained through a transaction with the Sirens.<br>
The meteorite, the Sirens and their meddling with our history, Wisdom Cubes, and the Watatsumi's power...<br>
They all appeared around the exact same time. <br>
There's no way all of that could be a coincidence.<br>
Five – the details surrounding Bismarck's recovery...<br>
Hang on a sec... "Not all Wisdom Cubes undergoing META corrosion will be irreversibly damaged immediately after crossing the critical threshold; some will begin displaying unusual characteristics for a short period of time."<br>
"These characteristics appear to have a connection to the Watatsumi."<br>
In other words, the meteorite, Watatsumi, and the Black Cube are all connected?<br>
I'm starting to see the full picture now...<br>
It feels like I'm so close... but just missing one last piece of the puzzle!<br>
Ugh... This is making my head hurt! Why did Musashi choose me of all people for this mission?<br>
Gaaah, what am I saying? Get it together, me!<br>
This is the great mystery the Reborn Combined Fleet has been trying to solve this entire time!<br>
We won't get a better opportunity to research this than now. Don't squander this golden opportunity!<br>
<br>
*knock* *knock*<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Alright, let's calm down and start from the top.<br>
There's got to be something about the Watatsumi I've missed.<br>
Maybe I can locate its origin based on its composition, and connect it to the meteorite somehow...<br>
<br>
*knock* *knock* *knock*<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
The Black Cube is another lead, but I don't even know where to start.<br>
All the experiments on it have failed, even with Gneisenau META's help.<br>
It's almost like something inside the Cube defies observation...<br>
But if so, what could that be?<br>
<br>
*knock* *knock* *knock* *knock*<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
The heck? Is someone at the door?<br>
Who would come here at this ungodly hour?<br>
<br>
BANG BANG BANG BANG BANG!!!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Geesh, I guess it must be something serious...<br>
Hold on a sec, I'll be right there––<br>

<br>
6 Late-Night Emergency<br>
Floating Fortress A1 - Sakura Empire Guest Area<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Gneisenau META：</span><br>
Finally. I was honestly afraid you weren't going to open the door.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
You were gonna break the door down at that rate! Who WOULDN'T open it?<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Gneisenau META：</span><br>
Everyone else, it seems. I've tried every other door already.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
You're joking, right? What do you mean you've tried every other door?<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Gneisenau META：</span><br>
That despite my banging, nobody answered, so I had to force my way in. Everyone I've found is unconscious.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
So you're saying... we're the only people awake right now?<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Gneisenau META：</span><br>
Indeed. Some unexplained phenomenon has left everyone from Iron Blood in a comatose state.<br>
Presumably, you are unaffected since you're from the Sakura Empire. In my case...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Because you're from a different branch, right?<br>
This is crazy... Iron Blood has full control over this Mirror Sea, and the Sirens couldn't possibly have launched this kind of sneak attack.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Gneisenau META：</span><br>
But it is not out of the realm of possibility for the Arbiters.<br>
Or, consider the possibility that there's an even more dangerous entity out there that is neither Arbiter nor shipgirl...<br>
In any case, that's the situation at hand. I should've been able to derive it when I saw Ulrich's condition earlier...<br>
She's been suffering from persistent nightmares and even visual hallucinations over the last few days.<br>
While I initially bought into her explanation that they were related to stress or her environment...<br>
I'm almost certain that isn't the case.<br>
This feels more like... sets of eyes, fixated on Ulrich.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Uhh... Could you run that by me again, but more simply?<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Gneisenau META：</span><br>
It's hard to understand unless you've fought against the Arbiters the way we have. In any case, someone's targeting Ulrich, and everyone else just happens to be collateral.<br>
And, my META intuition has a pretty good idea of who's behind it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Probability is one thing, 'cause you've fought them before, but what do you mean by "META intuition"?<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Gneisenau META：</span><br>
I can't explain it. It's instinct – a gut feeling that something from beyond this branch is here.<br>
At least you can take solace in the fact that it's not after you.<br>
Turn around, close your eyes, and nothing bad will happen to you.<br>
Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm heading to bed.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
...Bed?! Are you insane?!<br>
Your friends are under attack, and you're gonna do nothing?!<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Gneisenau META：</span><br>
Friends? I'm afraid you're mistaken.<br>
The "Iron Blood" here is nothing more than a fickle illusion. My only connection to this place... is Bismarck.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Liar! If you don't care about them, why'd you even bother trying to find out what's going on?<br>
Why'd you come knocking on my door with your full set of rigging out?<br>
These people matter to you and you want to save them. That's a fact!<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Gneisenau META：</span><br>
......<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Fine, if you won't do it for them, then do it for me. Help me resolve this situation– please.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Gneisenau META：</span><br>
...Very well.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
*sigh*... Just say so from the very beginning then...<br>
So, where do we start? Do we head to Ulrich's room and–<br>
<br>
BEEP– BEEP– BEEP–<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Huh? What's happening?!<br>
Did something just get turned on? Is the Flying Fortress starting to move?!<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Gneisenau META：</span><br>
I believe that noise came from the Tower of Midgard...<br>
Someone has activated the teleporter!<br>

7 Distant Rumbling<br>
Somewhere far away from the Floating Fortress, before the crisis began...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck：</span><br>
Do you know anything about the thief that stole the artifact from your museum?<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
We know that they're an unknown META, and that they stole a floor tile from the Library of Alexandria. Beyond that, nothing concrete.<br>
Whoever the culprit is, we'll catch them soon enough with help from our allies in the Ashes.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck：</span><br>
Let's hope so. Incidentally, how is the gate at Scapa Flow?<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
It's operating at 100% efficiency. No issues to my knowledge.<br>
And you? Any updates on the Sea of Stars?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck：</span><br>
Yes. Thanks to the intel you provided us, we were able to narrow down its coordinates.<br>
It was a laborious process, but we now believe the facility is located in the Rocky Mountains rather than somewhere in a lake or sea.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Really? While that'd be a good place to conceal something, it also sounds terribly impractical to use...<br>
Not only that, but it seems to have been built under the direction of the Naval HQ and is also involved in an unknown blueprint ship...<br>
The more I learn, the shadier it sounds.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck：</span><br>
While we're on that topic, have you heard the rumor that the Eagle Union is helping develop a blueprint ship for Iris Libre?<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
I knew it... I had my suspicions after there were talks at the World Expo between the two sides to jointly develop rigging technology.<br>
That sure does put some of what I heard in perspective... I wish my servant would just tell me what's going on in person.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck：</span><br>
You may get the opportunity sooner than you think. Apparently, the Eagle Union seems to also be developing something called the "Type II" rigging.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Developing what, now?<br>
Oh, right! The technology that reinforces the hull.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck：</span><br>
Indeed. I've already experienced some of its benefits.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Hmph... I'll have to look into that as well.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck：</span><br>
Moving on then. Has the Northern Parliament made any moves I should be aware of?<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Currently, they're conducting a large-scale operation against the Sirens in the Arctic region.<br>
It seems to be going quite well too. Have you not heard anything about it?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck：</span><br>
I have. The noteworthy thing is how quickly they're outstripping our projections.<br>
Anything else?<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
They apparently extended invitations to speak privately with the Vichya Dominion several times during the World Expo.<br>
About what, I'm not sure. But they seemed to be keen on avoiding the notice of the "Tribunal," and also apparently reached some kind of agreement.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck：</span><br>
......<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Are you not at all privy to that information? You're still technically part of the Crimson Axis.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck：</span><br>
Through the Crimson Axis' intelligence network, you mean? It's been half-defunct since Compiler's defeat.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Doesn't that ultimately fall on Clemenceau, the de-facto head of the Tribunal?<br>
Friedrich had a hand to play in securing her position. With her out of the picture, how willing is Clemenceau to still listen to you?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck：</span><br>
Our attitude towards the Iris Orthodoxy has never changed.<br>
We can't do anything about the Reenactments. They must forge their own future.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
I see. Nothing to worry about, then?<br>
...What's this? An urgent message?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck：</span><br>
From who?<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
It's from Scapa Flow. The gate is acting up, it seems.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck：</span><br>
...What?<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
I must see what's wrong with it. It's time we said goodbye for today.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck：</span><br>
Very well. If any equipment is malfunctioning, call me and I'll send over our experts.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Yes, yes... In the meantime, don't use the Tower of Midgard under any circumstances. Is that clear?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck：</span><br>
Of course.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
The very world depends on it. Goodbye.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck：</span><br>
Their Singularity gate suddenly malfunctioned? That's an ill omen...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Communicator：</span><br>
BEEP– BEEP– BEEP–!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck：</span><br>
An urgent message for me this time...<br>
Hope it's nothing too serious.<br>
...An emergency in the Tower of Midgard? ...We've lost all contact with the Flying Fortress?<br>
