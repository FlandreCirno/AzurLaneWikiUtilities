<br>
1 Why Am I the Secretary?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Edinburgh：</span><br>
S-s-s-starting today, I, Edinburgh, sh-shall serve as your s-s-secretary ship!<br>
C-Commander, I hope that our relationship can be p-p-productive!<br>
(Ugh... Two steps through the door and I'm already fumbling over my words... Why did the Commander choose me to be the secretary in the first place...?)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Belfast：</span><br>
My sister was chosen to be the secretary ship? I understand.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Edinburgh：</span><br>
What do you mean you understand?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Newcastle：</span><br>
Umm, in other words, the Commander has a sharp eye for talent, or something to that effect.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Edinburgh：</span><br>
T-talent? Are the two of you mocking me or something?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Newcastle：</span><br>
That is hardly the case. Though, I do hope you take appropriate measures to avoid coming off as rough-around-the-edges.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Edinburgh：</span><br>
(How am I, of all people, supposed to not look rough around the edges?!)<br>
<br>
...Edinburgh seems to be muttering to herself about something or other, but I have to get the day's work underway.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Edinburgh：</span><br>
Eek! Oh, y-yes, what do you need, Commander?<br>
Um... Organizing the documents? I can do that!<br>
<br>
Edinburgh seemed pretty nervous, so I decide to change the topic to try to get her to feel more at ease.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Edinburgh：</span><br>
Huh? Do I get along well with my sister?<br>
Pretty good, I'd say? I don't think I've ever gotten in a fight with Bel so far...<br>
She's pretty good at just about everything, so all I need to do is give her a little bit of support... Speaking of which, something did happen before––<br>
––So yeah, that's what happened! I have my pride as a big sister, right? Bel should really learn to rely on me a bit more!<br>
(Why do I suddenly turn into a chatterbox when someone starts talking about Bel... And why is the Commander asking me about this in the first place?)<br>
(...Gasp! Could it be, the Commander's true objective is to make Bel the secretary, and I'm just a stepping stone for that?!)<br>
<br>
Edinburgh seems to be muttering to herself again and is totally lost in thought...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Edinburgh：</span><br>
(C-calm down, Edinburgh. Even if you're not as capable as your sister, you still need to show off your strong suits!)<br>
(As long as I do that, the Commander's objective will naturally shift off Bel and onto me... Alright! Sounds like a plan!)<br>
Commander! Even if I may seem a bit clumsy, I have experience transporting important cargo like gold bullion!<br>
If you ever need someone to hold onto important items, you can put your confidence in me!<br>
<br>
And thus began Edinburgh's first day as secretary ship.<br>

<br>
2 Dejection and Smiles<br>
While sifting through my own paperwork, I ask Edinburgh to take care of cleaning the office.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Edinburgh：</span><br>
Cleaning is one of every maid's fundamentals! I'll make sure it's done flawlessly!<br>
Heh heh! See, my cleaning skills are certainly not inferior to Bel's. Now, to put away my cleaning tools...<br>
<br>
*CLAAAAANG*!!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Edinburgh：</span><br>
Ack! I knocked over the bucket! I don't even remember putting it over there! ...Where's the rag, where's the rag? ...Ahh!<br>
S-sorry for my blunder just now... Just give me a moment to prepare the tea, so please rest for now––<br>
Eek! C-Commander, there's a bug on your head! Please hold still, I'm going to get rid of it!<br>
I've got you now! Hyaaah!<br>
<br>
*THWACK*!!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Edinburgh：</span><br>
Eep! I, I'm so sorry for hitting your head... D-does it hurt?!<br>
<br>
<br>
And thus, the chaotic day finally draws to an end.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Edinburgh：</span><br>
*sobs*... How did all of this end up happening...<br>
Commander, I'm so sorry... I was just trying to shoo away the bug, and instead ended up hitting you on the head...<br>
<br>
At least now that things have calmed down, I have an opportunity to savor Edinburgh's black tea.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Edinburgh：</span><br>
*sigh*... I really wish I wasn't such a klutz... Um, what about the tea?<br>
Oh, yes, of course, I brewed it earlier... Huh? It's really delicious?<br>
Heh... Ehehe... I'm so glad that my efforts are worthy of your praise.<br>
<br>
Edinburgh, who had been wallowing in dejection due to her missteps, finally smiles again.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Edinburgh：</span><br>
I make sure to cast a little magical spell when I'm brewing tea~ "Become sweet and delicious~"<br>
The trick is to imagine somebody else drinking your tea, and putting a smile on their face~<br>
Hehe, would you like a live demonstration? I can pour you another cup if you'd like~<br>
<br>
I hand the cup back over to Edinburgh, and she prepares another serving for me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Edinburgh：</span><br>
Become sweet and delicious, become sweet and delicious... Now, Commander, please give it a try.<br>
Ahh... I'm sure this cup of tea came out great! After all, I put in so much effort praying for your happiness!<br>
...Huh? Why'd you break out into laughter all of a sudden? Did I get something stuck on my face?<br>
<br>
Edinburgh tilts her head with a puzzled expression. Seems like her dejection from before has completely vanished without a trace.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Edinburgh：</span><br>
D-don't keep it a secret from me~! I want to know what you're laughing about!<br>
<br>
What colorful, vivid expressions she has–– that was my first impression of Edinburgh after she became the secretary ship.<br>

3 An Afternoon of Sighs<br>
Port - Courtyard<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Edinburgh：</span><br>
Sigh<nowiki>~~~</nowiki><br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sheffield：</span><br>
Suffolk, how many times have I told you that the sink must be cleaned thoroughly?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suffolk：</span><br>
Ehhhh? D-don't you think your standards are a bit too high, Sheffield?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Edinburgh：</span><br>
Sigh<nowiki>~~~</nowiki><br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sheffield：</span><br>
.........<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suffolk：</span><br>
.........<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sheffield＆Suffolk：</span><br>
(*The two lean in for a closer look.*)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Edinburgh：</span><br>
Ehh?! If the two of you are going to come in, don't just sneak back out again!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sheffield：</span><br>
My apologies. We just happened to... notice some things.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suffolk：</span><br>
Uhh, yeah, what she said.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Edinburgh：</span><br>
Sigh... Do you two have a moment to listen to my troubles? It won't take that long.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sheffield：</span><br>
...I suppose I can lend an ear. But make it quick, I need to get back to lecturing Suffolk about the importance of sink-cleaning.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suffolk：</span><br>
P-please take your time. As much of it as you need...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sheffield：</span><br>
...I see. In other words, you're worried about dragging the Commander down with your clumsiness.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suffolk：</span><br>
But, what you described doesn't seem out of the ordinary for you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Edinburgh：</span><br>
So ruthless! ...Ugh, but at this rate, my own opinion aside, even Bel's going to have a lower assessment of me...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sheffield：</span><br>
...I fail to see how these things are related.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Edinburgh：</span><br>
Ah, um, it's because I'm a warm-up for Belfast, right? The Commander is probably going to appoint Belfast as the secretary ship soon!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suffolk：</span><br>
There's no way the Commander would do something like that!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Edinburgh：</span><br>
I'm sure of it! After all, why would someone as clumsy and dumb as me get chosen?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sheffield：</span><br>
Sigh... Listen well, Edinburgh.<br>
You are uniquely you–– and the Commander saw something about you that is valuable.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Edinburgh：</span><br>
I am... uniquely me?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sheffield：</span><br>
Yes. In other words, you have your own things that you are good at.<br>
After all, the Head Maid wouldn't force someone who is completely useless into the Maid Team.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suffolk：</span><br>
That's right! Just like how Kent is athletic and good at sports, and I'm often in charge of the weather forecast because of my good eyesight––<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Edinburgh：</span><br>
Suffolk, you know how to do weather forecasts?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suffolk：</span><br>
Knowing how to watch the clouds counts, right?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sheffield：</span><br>
Not in the slightest...<br>
If you don't understand what I'm saying, just mull it over a bit. Anyway, Suffolk, let's go.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suffolk：</span><br>
Noooooo! I don't want to be lectured! At least shorten it a bit... Waaah...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Edinburgh：</span><br>
Uniquely me... Does something like that really exist?<br>

4 Even the Meek Move Forward<br>
During the morning...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Edinburgh：</span><br>
Mmmgh... *yawn*...<br>
Mmh... I still don't know what is supposed to make me uniquely me...<br>
And I was thinking so hard about it that I slept in!!! Gaaaah!!! What time is it?!<br>
*pant*... *pant*... Oh no, I'm already late!<br>
Commander, I'm so sorry, I– Wait, huh? Nobody's here?<br>
Wait, my clock's time is–– No way, I actually arrived a few hours ahead of time?<br>
Oh, I must've read the time wrong since I didn't put my glasses on... Ugh, how careless of me...<br>
Well, since I already got up early, I might as well start my day off on the right foot––<br>
<br>
I arrive at the office at the usual time, but to my surprise, Edinburgh is already waiting for me when I open the door.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Edinburgh：</span><br>
Ah, Commander, good morning!<br>
What do you think? I made all the floors, windows, bookshelves, and desks sparkly clean!<br>
<br>
Certainly, everything in the office looks immaculate. She must've arrived really early to start cleaning...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Edinburgh：</span><br>
It's because I got up early–– not because I rushed over thinking I overslept on accident!<br>
Ahaha... Sometimes I feel like working extra hard so that you can have a more comfortable work environment, Commander.<br>
<br>
It seems like the truth leaked out a little, but I didn't really see any issue with it.<br>
So, I tell Edinburgh - "Thanks for all your hard work."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Edinburgh：</span><br>
Thank you for your kind words! Oh, by the way, the tea should be ready just about now! How about a cup before you start with work?<br>
<br>
When I look at Edinburgh, who is pouring tea while humming a little ditty, her mood seems extraordinarily clear, just like the pristine office.<br>

5 An Unexpected Invitation<br>
A few days later...<br>
The quality of Edinburgh's work as the secretary ship has been quite satisfactory.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Edinburgh：</span><br>
Commander, shouldn't you be getting ready to retire for the day? I prepared a new dessert for you today.<br>
<br>
*knock* *knock*<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Edinburgh：</span><br>
Hm? It seems like we have guests. Come in––<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Émile Bertin：</span><br>
Edinburgh, how goes your secretary work?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Echo：</span><br>
Hey there, Edinburgh!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Edinburgh：</span><br>
Émile? And Echo too? What brings the two of you here?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Émile Bertin：</span><br>
So the thing is, your partner for the dance can't make it due to an emergency. She asked me to come and apologize to you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Edinburgh：</span><br>
Eh? Oh no... that's quite troublesome.<br>
<br>
Seeing the confusion on my face, Echo explains the situation.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Echo：</span><br>
There's going to be a social party between the Royal Navy and Iris Libre.<br>
Edinburgh has been preparing a dance for the party. She's totally amazing, you know~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Edinburgh：</span><br>
Echo! You're exaggerating way too much!<br>
I just barely manage to avoid stepping on peoples' toes... Isn't that right, Émile?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Émile Bertin：</span><br>
Heh heh, Edinburgh is so dazzling on the stage that you should go see her when you have the time, Commander~<br>
Wait, that's perfect! How about pairing our secretary ship here with the Commander for the dance?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Echo：</span><br>
Woah, that's a great idea!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Edinburgh：</span><br>
Eh...? EHHHHHHH?!!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Émile Bertin：</span><br>
Doesn't that sound so romantic? Then this is for you, Commander~<br>
<br>
Edinburgh never recovered from her state of panic, but I take the invitation from Émile's hands.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Edinburgh：</span><br>
H-how did this end up happening...<br>

6 Partners Through Thick and Thin<br>
At the social party between the Royal Navy and Iris Libre...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Edinburgh：</span><br>
C-C-Commander, are you a-a-alright...?<br>
<br>
I am perfectly fine, but Edinburgh... seems to be as nervous as the day she first started her duties as the secretary ship.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Edinburgh：</span><br>
Umm, the rehearsals have been going well, but I get so nervous when I'm in front of an actual crowd...<br>
I d-d-don't think someone like me can do this... Aha... Ahaha...<br>
But... Even though I'm like this, the Commander still––<br>
<br>
Edinburgh seems to have been bottling something inside...<br>
I urge her to speak her mind, trying to convince her by saying that she'll feel better afterwards.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Edinburgh：</span><br>
Ah, um... Well...<br>
Commander... you chose me to be the secretary instead of her, right? I'm not just her benchwarmer, right?<br>
Commander... you found something about me that's valuable to you, right?<br>
<br>
I nod without hesitation in response to each of her questions with a dead-serious expression on my face.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Edinburgh：</span><br>
I see... Even though I'm a total klutz, you still chose someone like me...<br>
In other words... There's something that nobody else can do but me!<br>
Th-thank you so much, C-Commander! I d-don't have to be fixated on this single thing anymore!<br>
<br>
Edinburgh still seems ridiculously nervous... but at least I see some hope of breaking through to her.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Edinburgh：</span><br>
A-and, even if I end up failing, we'll at least be partners through thick and thin!<br>
Because, you chose me!<br>
<br>
As the music begins to flow, the two of us take our first steps together.<br>
The dance ends, and applause bursts from all over the venue.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Echo：</span><br>
I knew it! That was so amazing! The two of you were shining so brightly together on that stage!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Émile Bertin：</span><br>
Yes, that was quite a breathtaking performance~ As expected, the Commander and the secretary ship make a wonderful pair.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Edinburgh：</span><br>
Thank goodness... I didn't make any wrong moves...<br>
Commander, I won't keep asking about why you chose me anymore.<br>
Since you chose me from among so many other worthy colleagues, all that means is that I have to live up to your expectations. Ehehe~<br>
<br>
During the prolonged applause, Edinburgh says these words to me shyly.<br>

7 Everyone Knows Her Worth<br>
After Edinburgh left the office for the day, I suddenly remember something that I need her to do.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kent：</span><br>
Oh? I don't see you come to the kitchen often, Commander!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Suffolk：</span><br>
If you're asking about Edinburgh, she's not here right now. Said she had to buy some seasonings?<br>
<br>
Unfortunate. Guess I have to try back another time.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Newcastle：</span><br>
...By the way, Commander. Edinburgh has been the secretary ship for a pretty long time now. Is she doing well?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sheffield：</span><br>
Indeed. I always knew you had strange preferences, but this is...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kent：</span><br>
Hey! That's rude, Sheffield!<br>
But the truth is, ever since you appointed her, we've all been talking about how you have a good eye for talent!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Newcastle：</span><br>
Right. Even though Edinburgh may seem a bit rough around the edges, she has a mysterious ability to warm the hearts of everyone around her.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sheffield：</span><br>
...I suppose that's something only Edinburgh can do.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Belfast：</span><br>
––Master.<br>
Thank you for continuing to look after my sister.<br>
<br>
Right after leaving the Royal Navy dorms, I just happen to bump into Edinburgh, who was returning from her shopping trip.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Edinburgh：</span><br>
Oh my, what brings you to the dorms, Commander? Wait, huh?!<br>
It's gone! It's gone! My wallet's not with me?! I thought I had it a moment ago to pay for the groceries!<br>
I must've left it behind at the cash register... Ugh, why am I always like this?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："We'll get to take a walk together now."</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2："I think that side of you is cute."</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Edinburgh：</span><br>
What a positive way of spinning things... But, hearing those words from you really makes me believe the same thing!<br>
*sigh*... Are you sure you're fine with someone like me?<br>
<br>
I nod before taking Edinburgh's hand. Her smile is shy, but genuinely happy.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Edinburgh：</span><br>
Thank you, Commander! I hope I'll be able to do more to prove my worth to you in the future!<br>
