1. So Cool, She's Cold?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
...<br>
<br>
...<br>
A mysterious silence continues to pervade the office today.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
If you have time to stare at other people, you also have time to work harder. Or so I'd like to say, but...<br>
I've already finished sorting through the old documents. Anything that needs to be disposed of goes into that cardboard box over there.<br>
I also took a look at the documents on your desk. I put a sticky note on the ones you should probably give another pass, so make sure you don't forget about them.<br>
<br>
That was Ulrich von Hutten, a new arrival at the port. She had only taken up her post as secretary a few days ago.<br>
Her work ethic and the quality of her work were self-evident, but...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
I've finished everything you asked me to. What's next?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："That's it for the day."</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2："The weather's pretty nice today."</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Sounds good. Enjoy your free time, then. I'll be doing the same.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Hmm, I suppose it is... If we're done with work, I'll go take care of my own business.<br>
<br>
...Since Ulrich's assignment as the secretary ship, she hasn't spoken any more than what's necessary.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
...<br>
<br>
At this point, it wasn't even a matter of playing it cool. She simply seemed disinterested in others.<br>
Though there are other girls around the port who aren't very talkative, I couldn't help but wonder if she was able to get along with other people.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
Hm? You want to know about how I've been faring around the port? There's nothing to worry about. I can look after myself just fine.<br>
If you're trying to find out about my relationship with others, that's wasted effort. I'm here to be your subordinate, and it matters little what others think.<br>
I would recommend you do likewise. Focus on yourself first and foremost.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：...</span>'''''<br>
<br>
I wasn't sure if I should feel relieved by that answer, or more worried.<br>

2. Trouble at the Iron Blood Dormitory<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hermann Künne (Z19)：</span><br>
U-Ulrich! Are you here? You're here, aren't you?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Wilhelm Heidkamp (Z21)：</span><br>
P-p-p-please save us––!!!<br>
<br>
I was currently working with Ulrich when several Iron Blood destroyers burst through the door, practically on the verge of tears.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
...What's the ruckus? I'm trying to work here.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Wilhelm Heidkamp (Z21)：</span><br>
That... That thing appeared again! Please, hurry!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
...Ah, so the usual. Sorry, Commander, I'll be right back.<br>
<br>
I wasn't sure what was happening, but it was a surprise to see her getting along with other shipgirls, so... Out of curiosity, I decided to join her.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
Hmph. Whatever makes you happy. Not like there's anything special going on.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hermann Künne (Z19)：</span><br>
We leave it in your capable hands! It's too much for me to face alone...<br>
<br>
And so, I followed Ulrich into one of the rooms in the Iron Blood dormitory. I wonder what the thing that was causing such a fuss was...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
I bet another bat's managed to sneak in. It's fine, I'll make quick work of it.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："Will you need any tools for the job?"</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2："Are you going to chase it out?"</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
...No.<br>
Chasing it out forcefully is simple enough, but if we do... We'll just be stealing away the new home it painstakingly sought out.<br>
<br>
"So what do you plan to do?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
I'll help it understand that this is a human inhabitance, and that it'll unfortunately have to find a new home... Like this.<br>
<br>
Saying that, Ulrich flung open the window and took a seat in a chair right next to the window.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
All that's left to do now is wait.<br>
...What, got a problem with my way of doing things? Well, allow me to explain.<br>
Animals hate me. If I stay here, they're gonna get uncomfortable and flee sooner or later. Does that make sense?<br>
<br>
"I've heard about this before, but usually just for cats and dogs... Does it apply to bats too?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
Hmph. Whether or not you believe me, just watch what happens.<br>
<br>
And with that, Ulrich got up and started to pace around the room. Out of nowhere, the bat popped out and hurriedly flew out the window.<br>
She really wasn't kidding... I have no idea how that worked, but at least that takes care of the problem.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
Sorry, but this isn't the place you should be.<br>
...<br>
Hmph. What a pain in the ass.<br>
<br>
Despite her words, she wore a gentle expression as she closed the window. Maybe... Ulrich simply had a hard time expressing herself.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
...How many times is this now though? I should teach those girls a lesson for making me do this crap again and again.<br>
<br>
Though she comes off as grumpy and unsociable, I could tell she cared more about her allies than what appearances would suggest.<br>

3. Sing for Me<br>
在经历铁血宿舍那场骚动的数日后，假期到来了。<br>
既然没有指挥官工作，秘书舰也自然可以一同享受假期。——虽然真正目的在于想了解她平时在港区生活的状态。<br>
胡滕现在会在哪里呢……<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Admiral Hipper：</span><br>
之前借的CD还给你。我可是全都认真听了哦，你可要好好感谢我才行！<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
哦。感觉如何？<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Admiral Hipper：</span><br>
马马虎虎吧~以乌尔里希的审美而言，推荐的曲目还算不错。<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tallinn：</span><br>
嘴上这么说，听的时候感动成一副“这神曲怎么回事！！”的样子的人是谁来着？<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Admiral Hipper：</span><br>
我，我才不记得说过这样的话！<br>
<br>
发现了正与希佩尔、塔林一起聊天的胡滕与一个被围在中间的黑色箱子。<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
不论如何，能理解这些曲子中的妙处就行。还有……指挥官，你在那里做什么？<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Admiral Hipper：</span><br>
指挥官…？对啊，你来这做什么！<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tallinn：</span><br>
工作时间能在这种地方发现指挥官，真是少见……<br>
<br>
看来工作的样子已经成为港区同伴们心中的标准形象，休假的样子反而逐渐被淡忘了……<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
只是在闲聊一下音乐而已，没有什么重要的事。我姑且也是有兴趣爱好的哦。<br>
今天是你珍贵的假期对吧？不用管我，自由地度过自己的时间吧。<br>
<br>
要是就这么离开的话，就没法达成休假的主要目的了，还是稍微聊一下好了。<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tallinn：</span><br>
原来是在休假啊……那指挥官也想听听吗？<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Admiral Hipper：</span><br>
居然也想要听……难道你能理解这个曲子的美妙之处吗？！<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
没有听过的话是不可能理解的吧，况且指挥官参与这样的对话本身就很稀奇了。<br>
…………唉，没办法。<br>
<br>
本来以为她会拿出音乐播放器之类的，没想到——<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
很不巧，手头上并没有播放设备。当然……也不是没有办法。<br>
<br>
胡滕从放在身侧的黑盒中，取出了吉他。<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
接下来要弹唱的是我最喜欢的曲子。好好听着，然后把这种感觉铭记于心吧。<br>
<br>
演奏开始了。突然出现的美妙旋律与歌声让我不由自主沉迷在其中，忘记了时间……<br>

4. Cause for Concern<br>
Port - Exercise Area<br>
If I remember correctly, Ulrich was supposed to be participating in an exercise today...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
Is everyone ready? Then, let us begin our mock battle.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Admiral Hipper：</span><br>
Come at me! I'll show you what's good!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
Hey, Hipper, don't go so far ahead of the rest of the team! Slow down and match our pace!<br>
<br>
Though Ulrich and Friedrich belonged to the same ship class, Ulrich followed Friedrich's orders during the mock battle while keeping an attentive eye on the other participants.<br>
My eyes were glued to the mock battle until the very end, and at some point, it seemed that Ulrich had noticed my presence.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
So you were watching us.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："Looks like the exercise went very well."</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
If you say so. To be honest, I don't like fighting... But if that's what's necessary to bring back my allies safely during a real battle, I'll do it.<br>
By the way, do you not need me back on secretary duties? I can head back to the office if you need me.<br>
<br>
"I appreciate it, but there really isn't much going on right now."<br>
Above all else though, Ulrich surely must've been tired from having to learn a lot of new duties. I wanted her to take this opportunity to rest.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："Really, don't worry about it. Go and rest up."</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
If you say so...<br>
Huh... Was I really showing signs of fatigue, or is the Commander simply that perceptive?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
My child is correct. You've earned your rest. But more importantly, you should focus on yourself first and foremost.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
So you were listening in on us, Friedrich.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
I heard you became the secretary. While this may not be the case, my child may have come here out of concern for your well-being.<br>
But that worry is misplaced. Just like you, Ulrich is neither weak nor fragile.<br>
Just know that excessive kindness can be just as much of a poison as it is a medicine. Do understand that before you imbibe it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
Leave it. You're just going to confuse the Commander.<br>
Listen, I don't need you to look after me. Just let me know if things get busy.<br>
If you wait until you're already swamped, it'll be too late.<br>

5. Work, Work, and More Work<br>
An incident occurred the day before Ulrich was supposed to resume her post as secretary.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Ugh...</span>'''''<br>
<br>
A veritable mountain of paperwork had appeared on my desk. I had no idea why so much work would come in at a time like this, or how I was going to deal with it...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
Hmph... So what's all this stuff on your desk, Commander?<br>
I didn't expect you to be the kind of person to do something like this, but... surely you didn't completely slack off while I was taking my break.<br>
<br>
Ulrich, who had entered the office without my notice, was now staring at me intently.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
Easy now. It's just a joke.<br>
I happened to be walking down the hallway when I saw large amounts of paperwork being transported into your office like a cruel, ironic joke. So I decided to swing by out of curiosity, and lo and behold.<br>
Things might look bad now, but they're only going to get worse by the minute if you keep staring off into space.<br>
<br>
Before I could even respond, Ulrich had already grabbed a stack of papers off the desk.<br>
The clock had just passed 1300. Ulrich, who had been working in silence up until now, suddenly stood up.<br>
*slam*<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
Commander, let's take a short break.<br>
<br>
Ulrich pulled out an energy drink and slammed it onto the desk, using her waist to support a cabinet of files she had finished herself.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
All done over here. I'll take these files down to their respective departments, so you can go take a nap.<br>
Don't worry, I'll be back before you're up. If that's not enough assurance for you...<br>
<br>
For the second time, she pulled an alarm clock out of nowhere and set it down in front of my face.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
Here, I'll set an alarm for you. Use this.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："Use it? What for?"</span>'''''<br>
<br>
There was still too much work to get through. Even if I wanted to take a nap, that would better be saved for after I was done with these documents...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
Use your brain for a sec and look at how much work is still left. You wouldn't be able to finish it all even if you wanted to, so rest up for now and wait until I come back.<br>
<br>
"That sounds nice, but I don't want you working until late in the evening when it's supposed to be your day off."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
I already told you, don't worry about me. Besides, I'm choosing to help you.<br>
<br>
I'd feel even worse if I pushed all my work onto her, especially after hearing that. So, I guess I can try to power through.<br>
In the dead silence of the office, I continued to work by myself.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
Don't worry, I'll be back before you're up. If that's not enough assurance for you...<br>
<br>
That's right... I can't burden her with this kind of stuff... I've got to hang in there...<br>
...But I'm so tired, I can't keep my eyes open...<br>
––*thud*<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
...Out cold, huh. What a dumbass. A kind, considerate dumbass.<br>
<br>
As my consciousness slipped away, I thought I could hear Ulrich's voice again, complaining about something.<br>

6. Sing for You<br>
Beep beep! Beep beep!<br>
When I regained my senses, I was no longer in the office. I was back in my room.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
...Ah, you're alive, Commander.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："What happened...?"</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
You passed out on the desk while working. If I left you there, you would've gotten a cold and been out of commission for the next couple days.<br>
So, I brought you back to your room. Imagine how worried Friedrich and the others would've been if they found out.<br>
What's the point of having a secretary ship in the first place if you're just going to work until you pass out? Besides, even if I was on vacation, how would I be able to relax if something happened to you?<br>
In any case, just forget about this work thing and rest up. For real this time.<br>
<br>
Ulrich looked genuinely upset for once, and I stopped trying to get out of bed.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
...By the way, you hungry at all?<br>
<br>
Just as she said that, I noticed a delicious smell permeating through the room.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：(Nod weakly)</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
I see. I made some Eintopf earlier for you. Here, dig in.<br>
<br>
Ulrich helped me sit upright in my bed.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
Fwoo... Fwoo... Here, open up.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："Ahh––"</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2："It's fine, I can do it myself..."</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Finally behaving yourself, huh. Alright, have another bite.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''I don't think you can. Your hands are still shaking. Just behave and do as I say.<br>
<br>
Ulrich ended up feeding me the entire bowl of stew.<br>
I never had anything like it before. All I could say about her homemade meal was... "Wow, that was delicious."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
...I'm glad.<br>
Just rest now. Don't make the rest of us worry about you.<br>
Don't even think about work. As I said, I'll figure something out. Anything I can't take care of, I'll save until tomorrow.<br>
<br>
I felt like she was going a bit overboard to look after me, but... I suppose it's her win. Even so...<br>
I took a sideways glance at her as she sifted through the remaining documents.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
What, still can't fall asleep? Tch, what a pain in the ass.<br>
<br>
Saying that, she came back over to the bed and sat down by my side.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
...Here, let me sing for you.<br>
<br>
Ulrich's gentle voice filled the room as she began to sing a gentle lullaby for me.<br>

7. Behind It All<br>
The next morning...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
Zzz... Zzz...<br>
<br>
When I woke up, Ulrich was sound asleep on the sofa. By the looks of things, she had worked through the night.<br>
She wanted to make things easier for me, but in the process, took everything upon herself. I wonder if that was also a side-effect of being unable to express herself properly...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
Nnh... You're awake, Commander? How do you feel?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："Good as new."</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
I see. That's a relief...<br>
<br>
Ulrich let out a loud sigh of relief, before giving me a stern look.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
That said, I could tell from the way you pushed yourself to your breaking point yesterday... that it wasn't your first time doing something like that. That wouldn't have happened to you in the first place if you didn't overwork yourself habitually.<br>
<br>
"But I don't think I push myself that hard normally..."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
Hmph, how oblivious can you be? You're absolutely hopeless... Before you can look out for other people, you need to be able to take care of yourself.<br>
Besides, if you really wanted to learn more about me, you could've gone about it with more finesse.<br>
<br>
"...Guess I'm busted."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
No shit, I could see your intent from miles away. Doesn't take the sharpest tool in the shed to figure it out when you're following me around on my day off. One step over the line and you'd pretty much be a stalker.<br>
<br>
"...Was it that obvious?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
Well, yeah. But even if you were a stalker, I probably wouldn't hold it against you.<br>
So, you got to observe me for a day. What'd you think?<br>
<br>
I thought back to the time I was following her around.<br>
"You're always looking out for your allies... Even though you might come off as only caring about yourself––"<br>
"You actually care more about them, perhaps even more than others do."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
.........<br>
<br>
After hearing my honest opinion, she turned away and fell into a deep silence.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："Is something wrong?"</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
No, not really... It's just...<br>
Guess I ended up drinking that poison anyway even though I wasn't ready...<br>
Gosh, my head's a mess right now... I don't even know what to think right now. Feels like your curse is running through my veins.<br>
...In any case, all I need you to know is, I count you as one of those allies now. You can ask me for help next time, before all this happens.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：(Nod again)</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
Hmph. That's settled then...<br>
<br>
And as if nothing had happened, Ulrich silently walked over to the door, preparing to exit the office.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
Oh, and I forgot to mention one thing–<br>
Yesterday afternoon, the two of us went to the exercise area to observe the mock battle. Then, you came back to your room. Nothing else happened.<br>
If anyone asks, especially Friedrich, tell them absolutely nothing.<br>
Especially that part about us spending the night together after I sang you to sleep...<br>
