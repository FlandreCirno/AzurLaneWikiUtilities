Music!<br>
Greetings, everybody! Welcome to my secret shipyard!<br>
......<br>
Well, the effects were brilliant, but the speech could use some work.<br>
Let's try that again...<br>
Ahem! Greetings, everyone! This is the start of my great journey across the seven seas!<br>
Welcome! Welcome to my secret shipyard!<br>
Yeah! That's more like it!<br>
Before we go on, I'd like to ask you all a question...<br>
What is a sailing frigate?<br>
Now, ya don't need to answer right away. Just scrounge up all the knowledge about them ya can think of.<br>
Go through every little detail. Analyse your answer, and when you're confident in it, present it!<br>
That's right! As its name suggests, it's an armed ship that uses its sails to harness the power of the wind to propel itself!<br>
Its hull is larger than a typical sailing ship, and it even has armour plating and several decks.<br>
Put some cannons on one, and you've got a fortress that can sail on water!<br>
Where we Tempestas come from, sailing frigates are the undisputed rulers of the sea!<br>
Yup – you're in the presence of a mighty battleship. Doesn't that make your heart race?<br>
But enough telling, it's time to show. Let's get hands-on!<br>
Because we are gonna build our own sailing frigate!<br>

2 A Keel, a Soul<br>
Royal Fortune's Secret Shipyard - Keel laid down<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
The keel is an oblong structural part located down the middle of the hull's underside. It connects with the ship's sternpost.<br>
Its most important role is to function as the ship's load-bearing structure.<br>
From an engineering mechanics perspective, the keel bears the hull's longitudinal bending moment.<br>
In other words, an excellent hull is the proof of a ship's structural soundness.<br>
Furthermore, the keel enlarges the ship's side surface area, which is really important when sailing in a headwind.<br>
Its weight stabilises the ship, keeping it steady from heeling and unexpected turning.<br>
To put it simply, the keel is the cornerstone of a ship.<br>
And to a sailing frigate, it's like her core, or even her soul!<br>
Of course, a keel alone cannot support an entire ship.<br>
I want you to remember that its relationship to the ship's other components is just as vital.<br>
Now, let's move on to the next step!<br>

3 The Reinforcing Ribs<br>
Royal Fortune's Secret Shipyard - Ribs connected<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
The ribs are vertical structures which link to both the inner walls of a wooden ship.<br>
Their role is to support the hull, protect the hull's form, and absorb water pressure coming from the ship's sides.<br>
They're what allow a sailing frigate to cruise steadily, and prevent the hull from deforming due to rocking and heaving.<br>
Ships obviously want to be able to sail even when the seas are rough, and that's why they need top-rate ribs.<br>
And to maintain a large fleet of them, you need a steady flow of good shipbuilding wood!<br>
Believe it or not, some trees need to grow for centuries before they can be used to build a warship.<br>
Luckily for us, we have just the wood we need at this shipyard!<br>
With the ribs done, it's time to get started on the hull!<br>

4 Stringers and Their Role<br>
Royal Fortune's Secret Shipyard - Stringers installed<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
You need more than just the ribs to sufficiently support a hull.<br>
And that's where the stringers come in!<br>
Stringers are support structures placed lengthwise inside the hull. They're installed perpendicularly to the ribs and help form the ship's frame.<br>
The point of stringers is to make the ship even more stable, and to further improve the hull's structural integrity.<br>
The larger the ship, the more ribs and stringers it's going to have. The largest of them – first-rate ships – are like true oceangoing fortresses!<br>
Granted, those are also stupidly expensive to maintain♪<br>
Anyway, that's enough chitchat. Let's get back to construction!<br>

5 Learning About Anti-Fouling Paint<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
"Only those who journey far will know where their limits lie." The same is true for ships.<br>
It doesn't matter if you use the best wood around – it's still gonna rot if it spends too long in the sea.<br>
There are both visible and invisible organisms that attach to the ship's surface below the waterline.<br>
While they do give it a pretty colour and create value from a visual standpoint, for the ship itself, they're bad news.<br>
The organisms not only corrode the ship's bottom, but they also affect the cruising speed.<br>
If ya don't do anything about 'em, they'll leave even a good warship riddled with holes in less than a year.<br>
And that, my friends, is why we invented paints that protect against these organisms.<br>
What we'll use is a mixture of rosin and tar that's called "black material." While its performance is average, it's pretty darn cheap!<br>
Sadly, the coating will only last a year at most even if you lay it on thick. You're gonna need to repaint the ship every once in a while.<br>
So, what have we learned? That the key to a ship staying seaworthy for a long time is regular and thorough maintenance!<br>

6 Cannons Are Might<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
At last, we've reached this exciting moment!<br>
Cannons! The symbols of a sailing frigate's might!<br>
The section where the cannons are installed – called the "gun deck" – comes in two different arrangements.<br>
It's easy to tell them apart. It's about whether their cannons are arranged continuously along the sides, or if they're spaced out.<br>
The number of cannons also determines the ship's rate – its ranking, essentially.<br>
For example, compared to a fourth-rate ship, a first-rate ship typically has two more gun decks with continuous cannon arrangements.<br>
A fourth-rate ship, meanwhile, has around 50 cannons less than a first-rate.<br>
A nation commanding even one first-rate ship is proof of its navy's might!<br>
Although, first-rates don't mean much to pirates, of course. Hahah!<br>
On the open sea, speed is everything. Having way too many cannons will only slow you down.<br>
And that is why any respectable fleet needs smaller ships as well.<br>
A wise admiral builds their fleet according to the conditions and who they're fighting against.<br>
That's a fact that still holds up after many centuries.<br>

7 All About Decks<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
There we go! The decks and the mast are finished. It's almost time to set her to sea!<br>
But before that, I'd better give you a rundown on decks in general.<br>
The main ones you should know about are the forecastle deck, the main deck, the quarterdeck, and the poop deck.<br>
The forecastle deck lies at the very front of the ship.<br>
The main deck is right above the gun deck. Or gun decks, in the case of larger ships.<br>
The quarterdeck is situated just a bit ahead of the stern.<br>
And the poop deck, as funny as it sounds, is located at the very rear of the ship.<br>
It's the highest deck on the ship, and is usually where the helm and the captain's quarters are located.<br>
Obviously, the position and structure of these decks will vary depending on the size of the ship.<br>
That's the long and short of it! Let's hoist sails!<br>

8 Hoist Sails!<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Everything's in order to set off, but there's one last thing I wanna tell you about.<br>
You guessed it – it's about a ship's sails.<br>
From bow to stern, you have the jib, the foresail, the mainsail, and lastly, the mizzensail.<br>
When all these sails are raised at the same time, it's known as a "full sail."<br>
And that is when the ship can cruise at its top speed.<br>
But, ships usually lower some of their sails to adapt to the sea's often turbulent whims, a technique known as "reefing."<br>
When the wind is weak, they raise sails to catch more of it, and when the wind is too strong, they do the opposite.<br>
Doing this allows a ship to sail at a comparatively stable speed.<br>
Knowing what to do in a storm is also required knowledge in order to sail.<br>
When a storm blows, you raise only your topsail and keep all other sails lowered.<br>
That way, your bow will stay raised, and you won't go off-course 'cause of any strong winds.<br>
You could argue that mastering the art of raising and lowering your sails is THE most important part of sailing.<br>
Then again, I reckon you folks already know that, no?<br>
Now... Hoist sails and weigh anchor!<br>
Let our great journey begin!<br>
