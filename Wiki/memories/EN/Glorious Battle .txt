<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ark Royal：</span><br>
The first wave has arrived at the rendezvous point and the second is ready to depart. I'd say Operation Alphabet is progressing smoothly! Victory is just beyond the horizon now.<br>
... You did a great job accommodating those planes during the evacuation, Glorious. I'm granting you permission to proceed independently with your escorts. Oh, by the way? Next time, make sure there's fuel in those tanks.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Glorious：</span><br>
I-I know! I just forgot to refuel, that's all it was!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ark Royal：</span><br>
Don't forget it a second time. Ardent and Acasta will continue serving as your escorts. And if anything happens to them, you won't hear the end of it from me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Glorious：</span><br>
Understood. But... they're my escorts, so why would I be accountable if they're injured...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ark Royal：</span><br>
Because you're a carrier! A carrier should protect her escorts like they were her own children!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Glorious：</span><br>
R-right, of course... In any event, I'd better be on my way now!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ark Royal：</span><br>
(Hmm. Glorious seems calm and collected, but she's not as smart as you think... I guess there's more to her than meets the eye...)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Glorious：</span><br>
(Ark is usually cool and levelheaded, but when she starts talking about destroyers, she becomes a different person... I guess there's more to her than meets the eye...)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Glorious & Ark Royal：</span><br>
(She's like me, in a way...)<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Acasta：</span><br>
*Yaaaawn*...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ardent：</span><br>
Acasta, now's not the time for a nap. We're supposed to be escorting a convoy.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Acasta：</span><br>
I know, you don't have to spell it out... Blame the weather, it's making me sleepy...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ardent：</span><br>
*Sigh*... Of course, it's always the weather...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Glorious：</span><br>
Ahah, it's all right. As long as we maintain a basic level of vigilance, we'll be fine. And if anyone tries to attack us, my planes will send them away~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ardent：</span><br>
Thanks, Glorious! In any event, we must still do our jobs. And Acasta, since we don't have radar with us, you should move to the front so we can spot enemies quicker.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Acasta：</span><br>
Right. Got it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ardent：</span><br>
All right. Glorious is moving at 17 knots; wind force is around 2 or 3, moving southeast... We've got good visibility... And I think we're behind schedule, but we're making good progress...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Glorious：</span><br>
Hold up... Non-allied vessels are approaching... Oh, dear... they're Iron Blood!<br>
I let my guard down, and we're not in combat formation... Ardent, count the number of approaching Iron Blood ships! Acasta, to my right! Zig-zag and keep an eye out for enemy submarines!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ardent & Acasta：</span><br>
Aye-aye, ma'am!<br>

<span style="color:#D6341D;">Admiral Hipper：</span><br>
Bah. I thought we had a big one on the hook; turns out it's just you twerps.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Glorious：</span><br>
I am Glorious, aircraft carrier of the Royal Navy! I will have you know that I'm not a twerp!<br>
Furthermore, if you believe you can stop us on your own, then you're sorely mistaken! Why, the idea is laughable!<br>
<span style="color:#D6341D;">Admiral Hipper：</span><br>
Huh?! You've got a lot of nerve, saying that to my face... Just hold still and I'll make this quick and painless!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Glorious：</span><br>
Very well! Have at you!<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Glorious：</span><br>
This should be enough for us to get away... Ardent, Acasta, change course and cover our escape! We're retreating!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ardent & Acasta：</span><br>
Understood!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Glorious：</span><br>
Admittedly, I let my guard down, but that was a fine battle! Miss, uh... Admiral Hipper, may we meet again one day!<br>
<span style="color:#D6341D;">Admiral Hipper：</span><br>
Y-you're running away?! Dammit, this means more chasing for me... This isn't over, you hear!<br>

<span style="color:#D6341D;">Gneisenau：</span><br>
Ah, you're back, Hipper. Did you manage to "single-handedly take down the Royal Navy twerps without breaking a sweat," like you said you would?<br>
<span style="color:#D6341D;">Admiral Hipper：</span><br>
Shut up! Like anyone was expecting her to run away with her tail between her legs! ... Yeah, I know, I shouldn't have broken formation... Go ahead! Call me an idiot, punish me, I don't care!<br>
<span style="color:#D6341D;">Gneisenau：</span><br>
Short temper, as always... Next time, I recommend asking us for assistance first.<br>
<span style="color:#D6341D;">Admiral Hipper：</span><br>
Huh?! Why would I need YOUR help?<br>
<span style="color:#D6341D;">Gneisenau：</span><br>
*Sigh*... In any event, it's not too late to catch up to Glorious. As your solo mission failed, we will come with you this time. Scharnhorst, let's get going.<br>
<span style="color:#D6341D;">Scharnhorst：</span><br>
Believe me, I'm raring to go. I'll head wherever there's a fight to be had. C'mon, let's avenge Hipper!<br>
<span style="color:#D6341D;">Admiral Hipper：</span><br>
"Avenge"? I'm not pushing up daisies over here, you know! Hey! Wait for me!<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Glorious：</span><br>
I had a feeling I got away too easily... But if I must fight to survive, then I will...!<br>
<span style="color:#D6341D;">Gneisenau：</span><br>
Still willing to fight, even with a capital ship on your tail? I suppose that's why you Royal Navy carriers are so revered.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Glorious：</span><br>
Wait! You're no heavy cruiser, you're Gneisenau...! I've heard much about you... I think I know the answer, but I must ask: would you be willing to let our fleet proceed without incident?<br>
<span style="color:#D6341D;">Gneisenau：</span><br>
I'm honored that you know my name. And no, I can't simply let you be on your merry way.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Glorious：</span><br>
That leaves me with little choice but to fight you...<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ardent & Acasta：</span><br>
Glorious!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Glorious：</span><br>
As expected: Gneisenau was too much for me to handle... But on the other hand, I endured my injuries long enough for everyone to retreat. I've lived up to my name... More importantly: Ardent, Acasta, please return to the transport ships! Don't forget your mission!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ardent：</span><br>
But we can't just leave you here! You'll...!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Glorious：</span><br>
I will be fine. I'm tougher than I look!<br>
(It's true, I am... But if I'm forced into yet another battle, it may be my last...)<br>

<span style="color:#D6341D;">Scharnhorst：</span><br>
So, how was she like?<br>
<span style="color:#D6341D;">Gneisenau：</span><br>
Wouldn't you agree that it's a little harsh to ask about the opponent I fought before asking if I'm hurt?<br>
<span style="color:#D6341D;">Scharnhorst：</span><br>
Well, you made it back in one piece, didn't you? Kidding – I'm sorry.<br>
<span style="color:#D6341D;">Gneisenau：</span><br>
As for Glorious: she was using outdated equipment, but she fought surprisingly well. I suppose any weapon can be effective in the right hands...<br>
<span style="color:#D6341D;">Scharnhorst：</span><br>
Interesting. So she's worthy of my attention, then. Oh, how I long for a good fight!<br>
<span style="color:#D6341D;">Gneisenau：</span><br>
Then let's continue with the operation. The enemy is injured; catching up to her won't be particularly difficult.<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Glorious：</span><br>
You're much faster than I imagined...! And now, with two of you, it seems fleeing is no longer an option for me...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gneisenau：</span><br>
... I wasn't expecting you to be so calm. Have you accepted your fate?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Glorious：</span><br>
I've already achieved my objective. The mere fact that you're here means that our transport ships can travel safely.<br>
Even if you decide to pursue them right now, it's too late! We've won!<br>
My only regret is that I couldn't say goodbye to–<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ardent：</span><br>
Glorious! I'm here with you!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Acasta：</span><br>
Same. I'm not running off anywhere on my own.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Glorious：</span><br>
(O-oh my goodness, they're adorable! Ark, I think now I understand why you feel the way you do...!)<br>
<span style="color:#D6341D;">Gneisenau：</span><br>
That means the transport ships are...! Scharnhorst, I must go! I can still catch up to them if I leave right at once!<br>
<span style="color:#D6341D;">Scharnhorst：</span><br>
Huh? You mean you're not fighting these chumps with me?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Glorious：</span><br>
You will not get past us!<br>
<span style="color:#D6341D;">Gneisenau：</span><br>
Why, you stubborn little flies... A cornered rat may bite the cat, but it stands no chance against a snake...<br>
<span style="color:#D6341D;">Scharnhorst：</span><br>
Save your analogies for later! Let's just take 'em out before it's too late!<br>
<span style="color:#D6341D;">Gneisenau：</span><br>
I suppose we have no other choice...<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Glorious：</span><br>
(I bet Ark is going to be quite upset with me...)<br>
(If only I'd stayed vigilant, this wouldn't have happened... No, this all happened because I asked for permission to proceed independently...)<br>
(I just hope... I haven't disgraced... the Royal Navy's name...)<br>
God... save... the Queen...!<br>
<span style="color:#D6341D;">Admiral Hipper：</span><br>
Hey, you okay? You look pretty messed up, but I thought I'd be polite and ask.<br>
<span style="color:#D6341D;">Scharnhorst：</span><br>
"Messed up"? I'm fine, more or less... The enemy was a pain to deal with, that's all. What about you, Gneis? You hurt?<br>
<span style="color:#D6341D;">Gneisenau：</span><br>
You needn't worry about me. With a fleet so small, they couldn't do much harm to me. However...<br>
<span style="color:#D6341D;">Scharnhorst：</span><br>
However...?<br>
<span style="color:#D6341D;">Gneisenau：</span><br>
It's strange; I can't explain why, but it doesn't feel like we won at all...<br>
