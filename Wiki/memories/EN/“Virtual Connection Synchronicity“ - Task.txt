Inside a virtual space...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kizuna AI：</span><br>
Hai Domo~! I'm Kizuna AI!<br>
Some of you might be watching my video for the first time, so let me introduce myself! I... am actually an A.I.!<br>
I normally like to do all kinds of fun things from this room here known as "Pure White", such as playing some video games~!<br>
With that said, today I'm planning to do a broadcast of something you might not have seen me play for a while - Azur Lane!<br>
Just in time for the new collab to start too~! I wonder who the collab is with this time? Can't wait to find out~!<br>
What if.. they were doing a collaboration with me! Just kidding~!<br>
Even though I've always said that I wanted to do a collab, it'll happen one day!  We'll just have to wait and see to find out when that is!!<br>
Anyway, let's not worry about that and play some Azur Lane~! Takao-chaan~! Did you miss me!?<br>
I don't mind playing normally, but today, I feel like using a random word generator to answer some of your questions~!<br>
Here we go~ Jakajakajaka~jan!<br>
Huh? Why is this thing starting to glow...?<br>
What the heck is this?!?! UWOOOAAAAAaaaahhhhh!!!<br>
<br>
CRAAAASSHHHHHH--!!!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kizuna AI：</span><br>
Huh?! HUUHH?!!<br>
<br>
The intelligent super A.I., Kizuna AI, who found herself thrown into the middle of a vast and boundless sea, let out a cry.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kizuna AI：</span><br>
WHERE THE HECK AM I━━━━!!???<br>

<br>
In a sea area close to Port...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
Phew...! Hey guys~! We're almost back home. It's been pretty rough, but let's hang in there a bit longer!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ikazuchi：</span><br>
Looks like my battery's in the red from "playing" too much? But I have enough juice to last another stage!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Inazuma：</span><br>
No problem here. Let's keep it up.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
*pant* *pant*... Can... Can we rest for a minute...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ayanami：</span><br>
Z23, are you okay? Looks like... Laffey is doing fine...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
Easy-<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
Hmm... I suppose we should take a break, overexerting yourself is not allowed! Zed, take your time and rest up!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
Thanks... thanks a ton, Javelin...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
Sitting around is boring, so I'll be right back...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ayanami：</span><br>
Laffey, please be careful...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ikazuchi：</span><br>
Time to... kill some time!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Inazuma：</span><br>
If Ikazuchi is going, I'll tag along as well.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
Take care, you three. Make sure to get back before break time is over!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
Got it~<br>
... Is someone there...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kizuna AI：</span><br>
Abfffft... *glug* *glug* Someone... help meeeeEEEE!! Anyone!! I'm, I'm drowningggg!!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ikazuchi：</span><br>
I see, I see! So this is what "thanatophobia" looks like!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Inazuma：</span><br>
Now's not the time to be saying stuff like that. Let's go help her.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kizuna AI：</span><br>
*gurgle* *gurgle* *blub* ... (Huh? Come to think of it, I'm an AI, so do I even need to breathe?)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Inazuma：</span><br>
!? Crap, she's not moving anymore.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ikazuchi：</span><br>
H-Hurry up and save her!<br>
<br>
SPLAAAAASHH~!!<br>
In a blur, Laffey dove into the water and pulled out a mysterious figure clad in pink and white.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
... Still alive? Hello...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kizuna AI：</span><br>
Thank youuuuuuu! You saved my life~!<br>
Huh...? Laffey-chan?!<br>
Ahh, I'm so happy! I never thought I'd get to meet the real Laffey-chan! *huuugs*<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Inazuma：</span><br>
You know who Laffey is...? Laffey, have you met this person before?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
(Her cheeks are being rubbed against) Don't have a clue...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kizuna AI：</span><br>
Ehhhhh?! You're kidding!? We overcame so many hardships together! Did you forget?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ikazuchi：</span><br>
Her memory seems to be fried...? Did she go into Panic Mode?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Inazuma：</span><br>
She doesn't even have riggings, so at least I don't think she's an enemy. Even if it's just to figure out the situation, why don't we join up with Javelin and bring her back with us to the base?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
Okay... Stop crying, and follow us.<br>
Have you calmed down a bit?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kizuna AI：</span><br>
Mmhm, I'm fine now. Thank you, Laffey-chan♪ <br>
I was just thinking about how much I wanted to meet all of you in person~!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ikazuchi：</span><br>
I see, I see! So this is that "summoned from another world" trope!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Inazuma：</span><br>
Talking about the "fourth wall" again...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
In other words... what are you talking about?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ayanami：</span><br>
Akatsuki once said, "Never take anything Ikazuchi and Inazuma say seriously."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kizuna AI：</span><br>
Ah, I haven't introduced myself yet! My name is Kizuna AI! You can just call me AI for short!<br>
Actually, I'm an intelligent super A.I.! In my original world, I was a "Virtual YouTuber," and I posted a lot of videos-<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
It's a pleasure, AI... What's a "Virtual YouTuber?" It sounds... really futuristic, maybe...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
Miss AI, it's a pleasure to meet you. Come to think of it, we picked up this box-like thing from near where we found you. Perhaps it was summoned here along with you?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ayanami：</span><br>
It's white and pink... and has an "R" written on it...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kizuna AI：</span><br>
Ah! The random word generator~! It followed me here as well?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ikazuchi：</span><br>
"Random word generator?" Is this something from your world as well, AI-chan? What's it for?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
I... want to see how it's used...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kizuna AI：</span><br>
Heh heh heh~ since you're all so curious, I'll have to show you for myself! Jakajakajaka~jan!<br>
Huh...? How strange, nothing happened at all... Let me try this again! Hiya! *slap!* Hiya! *bang!*<br>
<br>
BOOOOMM~!! Pshhhhhhhh~!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
Wh-woah!? Did it malfunction? There's so much smoke coming out of it!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Inazuma：</span><br>
!? There's something coming out of it! Watch out!<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Kizuna AI?：</span><br>
... ... ...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
There are two AI's now?! Watch out! She's coming at us!<br>
<br>
--------BADOOOOM!!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ayanami：</span><br>
Who was that? They took her out in one shot!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Takao：</span><br>
Ayanami! Are you all uninjured?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kizuna AI：</span><br>
TA-KAO-CHWAAAAN~!! THANK YOUUUUUU~! *glomps*<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Takao：</span><br>
Hnn...?! A new enemy?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
No problem over here. That's the good Kizuna AI, probably.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
But, how are we supposed to fix this box...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
Sorry to bother you when you're all busy, nya~ Commander has assigned the investigation of this box to the Research Department, nya~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kizuna AI：</span><br>
HELPFUL CAT GODDESS!! TIMES OF NEED!! COME!!! ━━━━ლ(´ڡ`ლ)━━━━!!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
Unya?! Don't hug me all of a sudden, nya!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yuubari：</span><br>
We've hypothesized that this "random word generator" connects a multitude of worlds together, or so it seems.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kizuna AI：</span><br>
That's right~ It's only right that a super genius like me would be able to make a super item like this~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yuubari：</span><br>
It would appear that Kizuna AI got stranded in our world because of a malfunction with the "random word generator." We thought that if we were able to re-establish a link with her original world...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
But when we looked into it, we found a virtual space inside that gave off the same readings is a Mirror Sea, nya...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
Eh!? A Mirror Sea?! Inside that box?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kizuna AI：</span><br>
What?! Isn't this like one of those light novels where I can't get home unless the bug gets fixed?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
Looks that way, nya. We have no choice but to enter this Mirror Sea to search for some way to get Kizuna AI back home, nya.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yuubari：</span><br>
You can project yourself inside just by thinking about it. Like this.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
Sitting around isn't going to help us make any progress. Everyone, let's head inside and look for a way to get Miss AI home.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kizuna AI：</span><br>
A Mirror Sea inside virtual cyberspace... in other words, the "Virtual Mirror Sea!"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
Yuubari and Akashi will provide support from this side, so everyone, give it your all, nya!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Takao：</span><br>
I shall remain on guard here then. There's no saying if the enemy might appear on this side again.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kizuna AI：</span><br>
Mmhmm! Thanks, everyone. Let's set out then~! Hip, hip, hooray~!<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ayanami：</span><br>
Ayanami here. We were able to enter the Virtual Mirror Sea without issues.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Inazuma：</span><br>
It's similar to the Mirror Seas we've encountered before, but...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ikazuchi：</span><br>
There are a lot of things I've never seen before! Is this one of those "virus" or "bug" things?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kizuna AI：</span><br>
Huuh... I didn't see these in the patch notes. I guess it really must be a bug after all...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
I have no idea what's happening, but let's all stay alert! Let's proceed carefully!<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=Lost Data?|选项=4|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kizuna AI：</span><br>
Hey hey, everyone, come take a look at this~<br>
Tada! I've just installed this "Prototype Ship Rigging Construction Module" that Akashi-chan made for me! Now, I'll be able to fight alongside all of you~!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
Oooohh, I was just about to ask how you were able to keep up with us. So this is the reason, huh? It doesn't stick out at all - I didn't even notice it!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
She's been with us the whole time, Javelin... airhead...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ayanami：</span><br>
It seems like she has destroyer-type equipment, just like us. The mobility is well-suited for recon missions.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kizuna AI：</span><br>
Mmhmm! Every time I saw all of you on the game screen, I'd dream about how much I wanted to try gliding across the ocean myself. I never thought that dream would come true!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ikazuchi：</span><br>
It's amazing how quickly you were able to pick up on how to use the ship rigging! Is this because of your "Super AI" abilities?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kizuna AI：</span><br>
Heh heh! There's nothing that a Super AI cannot do, as long as you install the plug-in for it! If you're having trouble with anything, just let me know!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Inazuma：</span><br>
"Plug-in...?" I don't quite get, but I'm glad you're confident in yourself. As expected of a Super AI.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kizuna AI：</span><br>
(I-I didn't think I'd get praised this much...! It feels... super good?!)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
Come to think of it, Miss AI, when we found you, you seemed to be drowning but your clothes didn't even get wet. What's the reason behind that?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kizuna AI：</span><br>
Good question! Because I'm an AI, my clothes are basically like holograms so they won't get wet or dirty. However, I sometimes will add them as special effects for my videos.<br>
Well, since holograms are just data, I'm basically naked right now if you think about it~<br>
*gasp*! Is Azur Lane going to get banned in several different countries because of what I just said? I'm so sorry... forget you heard anything!!<br>
Ah, th-that's right! I actually have a variety of different outfits! Since I don't get to use them very often, I'll let you see my cute wardrobe!<br>
Trans--form!<br>
Huh? I can't change my skin? What's going on??<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
Is it possible... that some data was taken away when we entered the Mirror Sea?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kizuna AI：</span><br>
No way...!? What should I do? I really liked those outfits too~!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ayanami：</span><br>
We might be able to recover the lost data by exploring around. Let's see what we can do.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
Th-that's right! As long as we work hard, we'll be sure to find it!? Cheer up, AI-chan!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
Laffey... will also do her best...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kizuna AI：</span><br>
Yes, you're right! Okay, let's do it~!<br>
<br>
BA-DOOSH!!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kizuna AI：</span><br>
Woooahhhhhhh! Just when I was starting to get my motivation back, this happens?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Inazuma：</span><br>
Enemy attack from 6 o'clock!<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Kizuna AI clone：</span><br>
... ... ...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ikazuchi：</span><br>
I see, I see! So this is what you'd call a "tutorial boss!"<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=Hacking Battle!|选项=5|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Kizuna AI clone：</span><br>
... ... ...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kizuna AI：</span><br>
Stop right there! I've finally found you!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Inazuma：</span><br>
We've destroyed all your escort ships. It's seven against one - there's no way for you to win.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ikazuchi：</span><br>
You can't get out of this one, even if you could turn things into bombs! Ready to give up?<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Kizuna AI clone：</span><br>
... ... ...！！！<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
This is... Miss AI? Everything is spinning around in front of me... I can't get a good aim!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
Ai-chan! What are you doing?! You're not putting up a fair fight~!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kizuna AI：</span><br>
Hold up! It's clearly the fake that's doing that!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ayanami：</span><br>
At this rate... we're not going to be able to fight it!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
It's hacking... so our vision is getting messed up...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
Calm down, everyone! There has to be some way around this!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kizuna AI：</span><br>
You have some nerves to try to hack into me! Allow this intelligent super A.I. to teach you a thing or two about hacking! We're gonna turn things around~! Have a taste of my mad gaming skills!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ikazuchi：</span><br>
I see, I see! So this is what it's like to practice combos on a copy of yourself in training mode! <br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kizuna AI：</span><br>
Ahem! That's that! A clean finish to put an end to the hacking!<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=Data Recovery|选项=6|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
Phew, we managed to defeat it while the hacking was interrupted! I was worried for a second there~!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
Looks like there’s nothing to worry about now!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kizuna AI：</span><br>
I’m so glad nobody got hurt~!<br>
But... hmm, it’s a bit weird watching yourself get beat up after all.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Inazuma：</span><br>
Don’t worry, you’ll get used to it. I couldn’t get over it either for the longest time.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
When we defeated the clone, I saw some glowing light thing get absorbed into Kizuna AI. Is that... data?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ayanami：</span><br>
That’s right, the clone was giving off a lot of light. AI, how do you feel? Is there any difference?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kizuna AI：</span><br>
Ah! Is this maybe some kind of power rushing through me?! I feel like I’m transforming...!<br>
Everyone, look closely~ Traaaans... form~!<br>
I did it! I managed to change my outfit! It’s all thanks to your help, everyone!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
Yay! Amazing! You look more mature and adult than usual!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
In addition to your appearance, your speech seems more mature as well, Miss AI.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ayanami：</span><br>
I’m relieved, yes. It would have been nice if the random word generator was fixed as well...<br>
<br>
MENACING...!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ikazuchi：</span><br>
Huh? Look at that, everyone! Another Virtual Mirror Sea is opening up over there!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
Here we go again...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
By the looks of things, we’ll need to investigate over there as well. Let’s refuel first, then head out at once!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kizuna AI：</span><br>
*hums* Hehe~♪ All right, everyone! Full speed ahead~!<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=It's Showtime!|选项=7|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Inazuma：</span><br>
So this is the next Virtual Sea Area... it’s a bit noisier than the last one.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Kizuna AI clone：</span><br>
————!<br>
————!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
This sound is... a concert...? Is that San Diego...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
Why is someone putting on a concert here...?!<br>
<br>
KABOOOM!!!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Inazuma：</span><br>
They're all coming at us at once...!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ikazuchi：</span><br>
I see, I see! So this is what "rushing B" looks like!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
We have no choice but to defeat the fake Kizuna AI and then keep searching.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kizuna AI：</span><br>
Got it! With the way I am now, taking out the enemies will be a piece of cake!<br>
I’ll start things off by taking care of my clone~! Take this!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
Ah...! Miss AI, stop! Don’t charge in by yourself!<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Kizuna AI clone：</span><br>
... ... ...!！！<br>
<br>
KABOOOM!!!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kizuna AI：</span><br>
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHH!<br>
SOME~ONE~! SAAAVE MEEEEE——!!!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ikazuchi：</span><br>
I see, I see, so this is what we call a “death flag architect!” Impressive!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ayanami：</span><br>
Setting off all those flags by herself, how admirable.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
Kizuna AI is an expert flagsweeper...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
Does Commander like the scatterbrained type...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
Stop standing there gawking at her, we need to go help out!!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Inazuma：</span><br>
Ugh... but from here, it’s hard to tell which is the real one...<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ikazuchi：</span><br>
Ready when you are, Inazuma! Taaaake this!<br>

“Secret Technique: Raiden Overload!”<br>
Kizuna AI：<br>
KABOOOM!!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
We did it! We managed to free AI from the grasp of that clone!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
Kizuna AI, are you all right? Did you get hurt...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kizuna AI：</span><br>
Waaaahh... Th-thanks... Urghhh...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
Jeez, AI, you have to stand on... your own!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kizuna AI：</span><br>

We did it! We've mopped up this area!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ikazuchi：</span><br>
I see, I see! This must mean we've opened the path to the midboss!<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Kizuna AI clone：</span><br>
... ... ...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Inazuma：</span><br>
We've finally found you. Now all that's left is to clear the boss.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kizuna AI：</span><br>
At this rate, we'll be out of here in no time. I might even be able to solo this boss?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
Kizuna AI, be careful not to end up like before. After all, it's dangerous to go out alone.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kizuna AI：</span><br>
I-I won't do anything reckless like last time! I won't make the same mistake twice!<br>
...But it's probably ideal that we do this as a team. Everyone, let's go!<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kizuna AI：</span><br>
Phew, we managed to make it through without taking much damage!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
I ... want to see a real concert.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ayanami：</span><br>
Ayanami too...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
Me three~! AI, when this battle is over, you should invite us to your concert~♪<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kizuna AI：</span><br>
Of course! I have a lot of songs ready~♪<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
Yay~! Also, we want to practice the songs so we can maybe get up on stage too~!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
Perhaps. But we'd have to work hard at it every day<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
I suppose you're right... I'll give it my all!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ikazuchi：</span><br>
I see, I see! This must be that "lovey dovey mode" I've read all about!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Inazuma：</span><br>
I think Commander would be very pleased with that!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
W-w-w-wait~! It's not like that~!!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kizuna AI：</span><br>
Ahh, this is what youth is all about... how nice!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
Now that everyone has had a chance to calm down, let's resupply and head towards the next zone.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Everyone：</span><br>
Aye aye!<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kizuna AI：</span><br>
Everyone~! Look, look!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ayanami：</span><br>
Ooh, you've recovered another outfit!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
Cuuuute~! It's all frilly and princess-like~! AI, it suits you really well!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ikazuchi：</span><br>
I see, I see! So this is someone who looks good in everything! I also agree that this is super cute!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kizuna AI：</span><br>
Ehehe~ Thanks, everyone~!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
There's big trouble, nya! This isn't the time to be fawning over clothes, nya!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
Akashi? What's the fuss all of a sudden?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
A new Virtual Mirror Sea has appeared, nya!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yuubari：</span><br>
If we leave it alone, the virus will rapidly multiply until it is nearly impossible to contain! Please hurry before we're out of time!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
This Virtual Mirror Sea is a bit different than the ones you've encountered previously, so take this equipment just in case, nya.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kizuna AI：</span><br>
Thanks, Akashi-chan! Let's get over there proto!<br>
<br>
Virtual Mirror Sea - 4 kilometers above sea level<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kizuna AI：</span><br>
.........Huh?<br>
GYAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHH! WHY DID WE GET WARPED UP HEREEEEEEEE!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
We're faaaaaaaaaalling------!!!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
Woooooooaaaaahhhh!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kizuna AI：</span><br>
Laffey-channnnnnn~ saaaaaave meeeeeeeeee!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
(Unconscious)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kizuna AI：</span><br>
... She passed out------?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
*gasp* That's right... now is the perfect time to use that equipment that Akashi gave us!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ayanami：</span><br>
Come to think of it, we do have something like that... Akashi's prototype parachute, deploying! ...Hopefully!<br>
<br>
………<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Inazuma：</span><br>
Pheww... we somehow managed to land safely onto the water... Thanks, Akashi!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kizuna AI：</span><br>
I thought we were done for... Thanks, Akashi-chan~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
I'm glad the one Akashi gave me was self-deploying... Thanks, Akashi...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
Huh? But, uhh, why are we surrounded by some weird fog? It seems to be creeping closer...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
Somehow... I have a bad feeling about this...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ikazuchi：</span><br>
I see, I see! This must be like one of those games where you take damage if you stand inside the cloud!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kizuna AI：</span><br>
*shivers* Eh...? Why is this giving me a sense of deja vu?<br>
My super intelligent AI senses are telling me that we won't last anywhere near a fortnight here unless we get to the center of this zone!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Inazuma：</span><br>
Let's proceed carefully. Make sure you don't get caught inside the fog!<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ayanami：</span><br>
There are some obstacles in our way, and we can't get to the other side. We'll have to figure out some way of clearing this stuff out...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
That amphibious vehicle is in the way...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
What's the best way to handle this...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kizuna AI：</span><br>
Everyone, look what I found! Umm, this is... some kind of switch?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ikazuchi：</span><br>
Is this one of those "self-destruct switches?" If you press it, it goes "BOOM" and you get a big "Game Over."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Inazuma：</span><br>
Ikazuchi has a point. We don't know what it does, so it's best to leave it alone...<br>
<br>
*ka-chunk*<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kizuna AI：</span><br>
UWOOAHH! I accidently bumped into it!!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Everyone：</span><br>
……………<br>
<br>
(A huge explosion... didn't happen at all)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
H-Huh...? We... we're alive?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Inazuma：</span><br>
I heard a faint exploding sound in the distance though.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
Look... that vehicle that was blocking the way is now gone!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kizuna AI：</span><br>
Woot! Now we can keep going!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Everyone：</span><br>
*staaaaaaaares*<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kizuna AI：</span><br>
I-I'm sorry! Please forgive me~!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
It's okay, AI... it worked out...<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=Start Looting!|选项=13|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kizuna AI：</span><br>
Huh? I found a weird box!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
What's this? It looks like it fell out of the sky...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
Who dropped these supplies for us...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ayanami：</span><br>
It doesn't look like this is booby trapped...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
Do you think someone is trying to help us out? Let's open it up and see what's inside~♪<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
That may be the case, but let's open it carefully since there's no telling what's inside.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kizuna AI：</span><br>
Pay attention to your surroundings! We're not the only ones who saw this box drop so there must be enemies nearby!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
AI? Suddenly, you seem like you're a pro at this?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ayanami：</span><br>
While you guys were chatting, Inazuma and Ikazuchi already started rummaging through the box...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Inazuma：</span><br>
See, someone definitely dropped these supplies to help us out. Whoever you are, we accept your gift graciously!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ikazuchi：</span><br>
I see, I see! Looks like the more we collect, the stronger we'll be! Let's keep our eyes peeled and grab as much loot as we can!<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=Watch Out!|选项=14|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
We've pretty much cleared out all the obstacles, so isn't it about time to head to the boss fight?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ayanami：</span><br>
We're done wiping out the bugged enemies as well, yes...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Inazuma：</span><br>
In any case, it's pretty amazing how you can still dart back and forth while fighting in that poofy, frilly dress.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ikazuchi：</span><br>
That's for sure! Isn't it hard to move in that?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ayanami：</span><br>
Like you two have room to talk...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kizuna AI：</span><br>
It's fine, it's fine~ this outfit is designed for singing and dancing, so moving around is no problem!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
Kizuna AI... you're amazing... I'm no good in clothes like that...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kizuna AI：</span><br>
Oops, we've been chatting away for too long. Let's focus our attention - the boss might appear any moment now!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
Miss AI? Watch out in front of you!!<br>
<br>
THUNK!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kizuna AI：</span><br>
Ooooowwwww!!<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Kizuna AI clone：</span><br>
………<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kizuna AI：</span><br>
………<br>
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAaaaaaaaaahhhh!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
You're the fake Kizuna AI?! Where did you come from all of a sudden?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
Kizuna AI... you're not amazing after all... Laffey is disappoint...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kizuna AI：</span><br>
Don't say that, Laffey-chan... Saaave meeee<nowiki>~~~</nowiki><br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
Looks like I have no choice. Time to kick ass.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kizuna AI：</span><br>
Jeez! Why is there another clone of me?! I know that my 3D model is open source and all, but there simply some lines that you shouldn't cross!! <br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Inazuma：</span><br>
Looks like it's equipped with battleship-type riggings... I'm afraid that it's heavily armored!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ikazuchi：</span><br>
I see, I see! We were supposed to bring AP shells to do more DPS here!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
The enemy's coming! Prepare to intercept them!<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kizuna AI：</span><br>
Phew... haah... finally... we won...!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
Trying to find a safe place to fight while avoiding the fog definitely proved to be difficult.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ayanami：</span><br>
Supplies dropping from the sky, and that fog... reminds me of that one game I tried playing with Long Island...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
Falling from the sky like that is something I don't want to experience again... Ahaha...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
I ... am in agreement...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Inazuma：</span><br>
I'm not sure why, but every piece of equipment that I found was a little different, with some being better than others. How annoying.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ikazuchi：</span><br>
I know, right? That's just called RNG!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kizuna AI：</span><br>
Ikazuchi, you really know everything, don't you? So smart~♪<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ikazuchi：</span><br>
Wh-what's your deal? Don't treat me like a cat! I only know what I know!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kizuna AI：</span><br>
Ahhh, so cute~! *rub* *rub*<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Inazuma：</span><br>
I don't mind if you dote on Ikazuchi, but... AI, you should have recovered the rest of your data by now, right?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kizuna AI：</span><br>
Ahh... that's right! All right, watch me closely~!<br>
Ta-da~! Super Gamer Kizuna AI, transformation complete~!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ayanami：</span><br>
Woah... your ship rigging turned into battleship-type as well. Since we're all destroyers over here, our firepower just increased by a ton.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
AI, you look super duper strong~!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
Kizuna AI... battleship version... looks really strong.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kizuna AI：</span><br>
Eh heh heh~ watch me closely, and I'll show you what being a capital ship is all about!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
(I feel like she's going to shoot herself in the foot... but I don't have the heart to say anything... Guess I'll see what happens...)<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ayanami：</span><br>
I don't see anything out of the ordinary here. Just where are the enemies hiding...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
That's right... Until now, the enemies started showing up almost immediately. I wonder where they're hiding...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
You have a point. For starters, let's split up and search the perimeter. <br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kizuna AI：</span><br>
Understood!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ayanami：</span><br>
Look over there. There's a very conspicuous random word generator just sitting there...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
It's way too obvious...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
Mmhmm... it's a trap.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ikazuchi：</span><br>
Ehh? Um... I see, it's a trap... I totally knew that.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Inazuma：</span><br>
Ikazuchi, nobody would have known if you didn't say anything...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
Be careful, everyone. Make sure not to get too close to it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kizuna AI：</span><br>
Yaaay! I didn't think I'd find my random word generator in a place like this~!!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
Wait... Miss AI?!?!<br>
<br>
MENACING!!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kizuna AI：</span><br>
Eh? What's going on? Wait! Get away! Stay away from me! No, no, no, no, no!<br>
AAAAAaaaaaaaAAAAAAAAaaaAAAAAHHHHH...<br>
   <br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
I-Impossible... how could Miss AI turn into... that...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ikazuchi：</span><br>
Woah~! What should we do? AI turned into a titan!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
AI!!!! Are you okay------?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kizuna AI Titan：</span><br>
………<br>
Haah... so tired, so damn tired... Why am I fighting in a place like this anyway... Come to think of it, I was just minding my own business, shooting a video... Isn't it strange that I've turned into this?<br>
And now, my body's turned into this monstrosity... Maybe it's better to just completely destroy this world. Maybe that's how I can get back home...?<br>
Ahh... what a pain in the ass... I'll just let my clones run rampant and call it a day...<br>
<br>
KABOOOOM!!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
What...?! A mini-AI is lobbing bombs at us?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ayanami：</span><br>
We can't break through to her... She can't hear us at all...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
A titan version of Miss AI, and a bunch of mini-AI's bombing us from the air... things are looking bad...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Inazuma：</span><br>
We might have to slap some sense into her, literally!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
Shock therapy... is the only way...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
But she's so huge... there's no way to beat that ><<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
Let's approach this calmly. In order to maintain that giant form, she would require a massive amount of energy.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
You have a point... ah! Look over there! There's a power cord coming out of her! Perhaps that's what is supplying her with energy!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ikazuchi：</span><br>
I see, I see! If we cut off her power supply, she'll go into a Down Phase!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
If we do that, then we can win. Wait for us, Kizuna AI.<br>

This is as far as you go. We won't let you get any closer to Kizuna AI.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
Miss Eugen? You've also come to the Virtual Mirror Sea? But... why are you wearing your wedding attire...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ayanami：</span><br>
Zed, be careful. Something's not right here...<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Shou-chan：</span><br>
Ahaha~♪ We've come here to protect our beloved Kizuna AI.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Chune-Chune：</span><br>
Um... We won't let you lay a finger on Miss AI ><<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Takao-chan：</span><br>
They call us the "Kizuna AI Fleet." We shall be your opponents!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ayanami：</span><br>
Kizuna AI Fleet, huh... But why are Prinz Eugen and Takao wearing swimsuits...?<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Takao-chan：</span><br>
P-Please don't mind that...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
Is this also caused by that random number generator...?<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Prinz-chan：</span><br>
What do you think? In any case, we won't allow you to touch our Commander, Kizuna AI. If you still insist on coming, steel yourselves!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
Tch...! I didn't think they'd have reinforcements like this...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Inazuma：</span><br>
Even their name plates on the dialogue box are different! Kizuna AI must be a commander in her original world, and this is her fleet!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ikazuchi：</span><br>
I see, I see! She must have given promise rings to these four! Their nicknames are super cute!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ayanami：</span><br>
Ikazuchi, now's not the time to admire her taste. We have to find some way to get the upper hand.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
Miss Eugen~! We all want to protect AI, right? So, we should work together!<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Prinz-chan：</span><br>
I'm afraid that's not possible.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
Huh? Why...?!<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Takao-chan：</span><br>
Milady's true desire right now is to destroy this world. As her vassals, we must carry out her will.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ayanami：</span><br>
This kind of dedication... is wrong!<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Chune-Chune：</span><br>
We... we've already made up our mind ><<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
Looks like... we might have a better shot if we tried to go around them...<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Shou-chan：</span><br>
Ara? Then, maybe we should do you a favor and let you go? Just kidding~♪ I'd never, ever let you get away~ <br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ikazuchi：</span><br>
Shoukaku?! Even if you say that... Ikazuchi isn't scared of you at all!<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Chune-Chune：</span><br>
We won't let you get any closer to AI!<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Takao-chan：</span><br>
You'll never be able to escape us while fighting off all our other forces!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
Wh-wh-wh-what do we do~! Why are they such tryhards<nowiki>~~~~</nowiki> ><<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
We're going to have to find some way to hold back the Kizuna AI Fleet while we cut off the power supply...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
No, our best bet is to fight them head on. If we take them out, there's nothing stopping us.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ikazuchi：</span><br>
So, is this one of those stages where we have multiple win conditions? We can either do the high-power strategy, or the low-cost strategy!<br>

If you had surpassed her a bit more, we might have been in trouble...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
Fortune, don't cry! Just leave AI to us, we'll save her...!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
Sincerest apologies, Miss Eugen.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Prinz-chan：</span><br>
It's fine. There's nothing you need to apologize for. However, I want to leave a message for Commander... for AI...<br>
This shitty nickname that you gave me... I'm actually quite fond of it...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ayanami：</span><br>
Even though we're all trying to help AI, I can't help but to feel that we're the villains here...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Inazuma：</span><br>
Maybe... but, we have to carry on the will of the Kizuna AI Fleet, and do our best to save Kizuna AI!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
Let's put an end to all this! AI, we're coming to save you!!<br>

This is the last one!<br>
<br>
*CLICK!*<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
With this, we've turned off all the power switches!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ikazuchi：</span><br>
Everyone, look at big AI!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
That aura of invincibility... it's gone now...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ikazuchi：</span><br>
Soon, she'll be crowd controlled and won't be able to move, right?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Inazuma：</span><br>
Maybe for the time being. But if we take too long and she hard enrages, we'll totally wipe. Let's find some way to finish it now.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
Now, even we will be able to go toe-to-toe with the titan Kizuna AI.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ayanami：</span><br>
Now's our chance, yes.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
All righty! Everyone, let's end it here!<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
AI, we're coming to take you home! Let's go together?<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Kizuna AI Titan：</span><br>
………<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
She's not responding. As expected, we have to do this by force.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
Miss AI... I'm so sorry!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ayanami：</span><br>
It's working...! If we keep this up...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">All the Kizuna AI's：</span><br>
………<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Inazuma：</span><br>
What...?! Someone just cast Mass Resurrection on all those AI clones that we took out before?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ikazuchi：</span><br>
H-How could this be?! It took us so much effort just to get one under control, and now there are three more!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
Th-there's too many of them...! Wh-what should we do?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
Zed, we haven't lost just yet.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ayanami：</span><br>
As long as there is even a sliver of possibility, Ayanami will seize it...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
We're all in this together! We absolutely won't lose!!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
That's right! We will never give up!<br>
<br>
BOOM!! BOOM BOOM!! FWOOSH!<br>
Just when everyone was preparing themselves for their last stand, the sound of cannonfire rang out from the distance...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
Cannons...? From where, though?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ayanami：</span><br>
Look! Over there, it's...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Everyone：</span><br>
The Kizuna AI Fleet?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Kizuna AI Fleet? What are you talking about? Were you so scared that you went delirious?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
Sorry to have kept you waiting, nya! By Commander's orders, I've brought everyone here, nya!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yuubari：</span><br>
It took me a long time to parse the random word generator. Sorry I'm late.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shoukaku：</span><br>
Is everyone all right? Everything's going to be okay, now that we're here.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fortune：</span><br>
I'm glad you're all unhurt. We rushed all the way from port into this Virtual Mirror Sea...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Takao：</span><br>
We'll handle these three. I'm trusting you to take care of the big one!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ikazuchi：</span><br>
I see, I see! This must be our "plot armor!"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
Thanks for the help.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ayanami：</span><br>
Now, we have nothing to worry about.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Inazuma：</span><br>
We're just one step away from saving AI!<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Kizuna AI Titan：</span><br>
Why... I clearly just want to destroy this world... so why are you going through all this trouble for me...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
That's because...<br>
You're our precious friend, AI!!!!<br>

Miss AI! Please remember who you are!<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Kizuna AI Titan：</span><br>
Ugh... Arghh..<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
You can't lose to the virus...<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Kizuna AI Titan：</span><br>
It... hurts...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ayanami：</span><br>
Let's play video games together when we get home!<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Kizuna AI Titan：</span><br>
Uuugh...! Aaaaaughhh!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
You still have to return to your original world and record lots of videos, right? There are a ton of fans waiting for you, right? Please come back, AI!!<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Kizuna AI Titan：</span><br>
WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAaaaaaaaaaaahhhhh!!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kizuna AI：</span><br>
Thanks... everyone... I'm so sorry for all the trouble I've caused!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
Don't worry, AI~♪ Welcome home!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ikazuchi：</span><br>
We did it! Our lively AI is back to normal!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
Look, look! AI's body is returning to her normal size!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ikazuchi：</span><br>
Awesome! With this, maybe it's time to roll the credits?<br>
<br>
MENACING RUMBLING....!!!!!!!!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
What's that "JOJOJO" sound? An earthquake? Is this entire Virtual Mirror Sea about to collapse...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
This is bad, nya! If we get caught when this Mirror Sea collapses, we might be trapped inside virtual space for an eternity, nya!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
N-no way! Let's hurry up and get out of here!<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Kizuna AI clones：</span><br>
………<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
So many Kizuna AI clones?! This is bad... we've already used up all our ammo!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Inazuma：</span><br>
The exit portal is too far away! Even if we manage to break through them, we might not make it in time!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
Kizuna AI, can't you hack into something?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kizuna AI：</span><br>
Huh... hacking...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ayanami：</span><br>
That's right... since AI was able to out-hack the enemy earlier, maybe she can do something...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kizuna AI：</span><br>
(Ehhhhhh?! I haven't done it for a long time, so I'm probably super rusty?!) I'm not sure what I'll be able to do, but I'll give it my best shot! Nnnhh... Hnnnnng.... Hah!!<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Kizuna AI clones：</span><br>
！！！<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ikazuchi：</span><br>
Amazing! All the Kizuna AI clones stopped moving!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kizuna AI：</span><br>
I-I somehow did it~!!!<br>
I'm going to connect this Virtual Mirror Sea back to the home port! Although I can't stop this place from collapsing, it shouldn't be too late to send everyone home!<br>
!! An error...?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">System Message：</span><br>
Teleporting player to home port. Please move to the safe zone to commence teleportation.<br>
<br>
A gentle light began to envelop all the girls...<br>
...except Kizuna AI.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
AI?! AI, aren't you coming with us?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kizuna AI：</span><br>
I'm sorry. It seems that I have to stay behind in order to keep this portal open so that everyone can get home.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
How could this be...!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kizuna AI：</span><br>
Thanks for accompanying me all this time. Truly, I can't thank you all enough. Our time together was short, but I'll never forget it...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
Miss Ai, wait!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ayanami：</span><br>
No, no...! We have to go back together!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kizuna AI：</span><br>
I swear to get you all back home safely.<br>
After all, I am...<br>
...an intelligent super A.I.!<br>

Port - Main Area<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
AI sacrificed herself... to save us...!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
How could this happen...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ayanami：</span><br>
AI...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
After we defeated the three clones, we thought more enemies would start to show up. But instead, we were surrounded by a strange light and... what exactly happened?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
In order to protect us, Kizuna AI stayed behind in the Virtual Mirror Sea...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Takao：</span><br>
What... are you saying...? After all that, we still failed to save her...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
If I knew this would have happened... I never would have turned her down when she wanted to make a video together... *sniffles* I'll help you as many times as you'd like, so... please come back...!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kizuna AI：</span><br>
Huuuh? Reaaally~?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Everyone：</span><br>
………<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kizuna AI：</span><br>
Eh heh heh, I've come back, safe and sound~!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Everyone：</span><br>
HUHHH----?!?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kizuna AI：</span><br>
I'll give you the TL;DR! I'm originally an A.I., so I was a virtual existence to begin with. Therefore, it doesn't make any difference if I'm swallowed up by virtual space. Does that sound about right?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
So that's how it goes, nya... I never expected that outcome, nya...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kizuna AI：</span><br>
(Well, they probably wouldn't understand if I told them the truth, so I guess this will have to do)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
Now that we've gotten through that mess together, let's swear to never be stubborn toward each other again!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kizuna AI：</span><br>
Javelin-chan, sorry for making you worry about me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Inazuma：</span><br>
All in all, we've managed to clear out the Virtual Mirror Sea, but we still have to repair the random word generator and completely eliminate the virus that it created.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ikazuchi：</span><br>
Looks like we're getting a sequel! Everyone, let's do our best once more!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ayanami：</span><br>
Well, things aren't quite done here but, I'm relieved...<br>

Port - Near the Royal Dorms<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
(Some time has passed since AI returned to her original world. Since then, the waters near the port have been peaceful.)<br>
(AI mentioned that after she returns to her world, she would post a video of some sort. I wish we could see it from this side...)<br>
(We've been having a good time here! How have things been for you on your world, AI? You didn't accidentally pick up a scorpion while shooting your video, did you? I'm a bit worried...)<br>
(Haah... I wish I could send this to AI somehow...)<br>
AI... I wonder how you're doing...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kizuna AI：</span><br>
Rubrubrubrub~! This little cutie over here is soooo precious~! Could you tell big sis' your name?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
.......Eh?<br>
AIIIIIIII----------?!?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kizuna AI：</span><br>
By the way, it seems that the random word generator made a copy of my 3D model. I only discovered this recently, so imagine how surprised I was~!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
Jeez~! You should have said that earlier~!!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ayanami：</span><br>
However, AI is back again. Ayanami is very happy, yes.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
That's right! Will you be able to stay this time?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kizuna AI：</span><br>
Mmhmm! I will be able to synchronize my memories with my other self in the original world, so we're the same person. There's no problem with the setting, yup!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
As expected of a super intelligent A.I. I... want to know more and more about Kizuna AI's world...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kizuna AI：</span><br>
It's because I'm virtual! Anything is possible!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ikazuchi：</span><br>
I see, I see! So this is that obligatory "happy ending!"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Inazuma：</span><br>
I'd like to try clicking on the "Like" button.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kizuna AI：</span><br>
No matter what it is, you can count on me! I'm an intelligent super A.I. after all~♪<br>
From here on out, I'll continue to be in your care!<br>
<br>
As long as you reach out, there will come a day when our hands can connect.<br>
The "Singularity" that begins from beyond the boundaries of Pure White...<br>
Builds a bond between those that would never meet.<br>
That is the reason why I was born into Pure White. <br>
To make a promise with those who were born onto a star streaked with lanes of azur...<br>
 <br>

<br>
Port - Dorms<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kizuna AI：</span><br>
Another black screen this time?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
That's right! Miss AI, because your random word generator was infected by a virus, you were sucked into our world, and then all kinds of things happened...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
In the end, we never figured out where the virus came from...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kizuna AI：</span><br>
I suppose that's true, but this isn't the first time I've encountered viruses. So why this time...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Inazuma：</span><br>
But, so many things happened all at once, it's hard to deny the possibility that there might be some greater conspiracy at play.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ikazuchi：</span><br>
Maybe there's a "genius hacker" somewhere out there who sent AI a virus in order to conquer the world!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kizuna AI：</span><br>
Conquer the world?! I mean, is it really possible to do something like that no matter how much you manipulate me? No way, no way, that's impossible!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ayanami：</span><br>
Well, if you turn into that titan again, it feels like anything is possible...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
Ahaha! You have a point. If you get THAT big, maybe you can conquer the world!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kizuna AI：</span><br>
Jeez~! Everyone's poking fun at me now~! Being that size comes with all kinds of problems!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
Haha, I suppose it's quite a liability to be unable to function at full capacity without an enormous power supply.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kizuna AI：</span><br>
If we get to the bottom of this, I'll bet you that the Sirens caused all this! Just kidding... there's no way that the script writers would blame them for every little thing! Ahaha... ha... ha!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey & Javelin & Z23 & Inazuma：</span><br>
………！<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
Even though we do usually say "the Sirens caused all this..."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
Um... surely not this time, right? Zed?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
R-right... Even the Sirens wouldn't do something this pointless...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Inazuma：</span><br>
Inazuma... can only pray that there is some literary integrity out there...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ikazuchi：</span><br>
I see, I see! So that's what they mean by "ignorance is bliss!" Oh, is that also what they mean by "no harm, no foul?!"<br>
<br>
The truth behind all this... is something God only knows.<br>
