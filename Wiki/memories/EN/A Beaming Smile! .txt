A Beaming Smile!<br>
<br>
Not Feeling So Well?<br>
HQ dumped an urgent task in my lap.<br>
"Examine all past records and draft a financial report," they said, which boils down to days of crunching numbers and scanning fine print made for ants.<br>
Port - Office<br>
I'm taking another plunge into paperwork hell today, taking my secretary down with me.<br>
Or rather, I would, were she not too innocent for that sort of stuff.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Makinami：</span><br>
Hey, Commander! Is this how you spell this word?<br>
Goodie! That means I helped you with your work! That's gotta lighten you up a bit!<br>
...Right? Commander?<br>
Heeeey! Ground control to Commander!<br>
What's wrong? I haven't seen you smile even a smidge lately...<br>
<br>
I turn to Makinami and tell her I'm sorry for making her worry about me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Makinami：</span><br>
Don't be sorry, be happy! Lemme see a great, big smile!<br>
<br>
Well, since she insists...<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Try your hardest to smile.</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Makinami：</span><br>
Uh... Yikes...<br>
Let's try that again! Come on, look alive!<br>
<br>
As per her request, I try again. And fail again. And again...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Makinami：</span><br>
This is really weird... Why can't you muster a smile?<br>
<br>
My exhaustion from working long hours is manifesting itself as the inability to conjure a decent smile, leading to Makinami's currently troubled expression.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Makinami：</span><br>
All right, I'll take over for you! I may not know all these difficult adulty words, but my stamina will get the job done!<br>
I love your stories, Oyashio! Tell me another one!<br>
Commander! How do you write– Wah?! Oh shoot!<br>
Oops, I tripped again... Hehehe!<br>
<br>
Come to think of it, you never see this girl *without* a smile on her face...<br>

<br>
Makinami to the Rescue!<br>
Port - Office<br>
The hours fly by and it's gotten late by the time I realize it.<br>
Makinami went to the archives to fetch some documents, but still isn't back yet.<br>
......<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">？？？：</span><br>
...Yeah, I'm just...<br>
...Easy peasy! I'll come along with...<br>
<br>
I hear a conversation coming from the dark hallway outside.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Go see what's up.</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Makinami：</span><br>
See? There's nothing scary about the dark!<br>
You have nothing to fear as long as I'm with you!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kiyonami：</span><br>
Thanks for coming along...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Makinami：</span><br>
Oh, on that note, why are you here anyway?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kiyonami：</span><br>
Well... I was on my way back from nighttime practice, and that's when I lost sight of everyone...<br>
Doing covert blackouts at sea isn't scary, but back at port... the darkness spooks me, especially when I'm alone...<br>
Whew... Thank goodness I found you, Makinami...<br>
Now I'm curious: why are *you* here? Do secretaries have to work this late into the night?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Makinami：</span><br>
No, not really? It's just that the Commander's been overtiming more than a faulty stopwatch recently, so I decided to put in more hours too!<br>
It's gotta be tough for the Commander... Stuck in a chair all day, reading and writing documents...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kiyonami：</span><br>
I-it definitely sounds tough... But I'm sure it's not all that bad with you for company!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Makinami：</span><br>
Mhm! Now if I can just bring a smile to the Commander's face, everything will be fine!<br>
Hey, I see the dormitory now! Let's have a race to the– Wah?! Oopsies!<br>
<br>
Makinami breaks into a sprint, slips, and just barely avoids falling over.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kiyonami：</span><br>
Oh gosh, are you okay?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Makinami：</span><br>
Yeah, I'm fine! I've gotten used to it! Hehehe~<br>
<br>
Guess I'll let them make the home stretch on their own. They'll be fine.<br>

<br>
Happy to Help!<br>
Port - Office<br>
Welp, time to get back into the ring and slog through more documents.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Makinami：</span><br>
Hmm...<br>
<br>
Once again, Makinami is peeping at me with evident concern.<br>
I bet she wants me to divide some of the work with her, but this is far out of her league.<br>
(Knock knock)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kongou：</span><br>
Pardon our intrusion, Commander.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Haruna：</span><br>
Hello.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Makinami：</span><br>
Oh! Kongou! Haruna!<br>
<br>
The clouds of concern looming over her clear up in a flash, revealing a bright smile.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kongou：</span><br>
Ah, I presume you are presently serving as the Commander's secretary, Makinami?<br>
Can you promise that you will try not to be a burden around the office?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Makinami：</span><br>
Hey, I'm not a burden bird! I'm doing a great job going around retrieving mail and documents and stuff!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kongou：</span><br>
Ahah, most excellent. You deserve a reward for your diligence. What do you say I ask Hiei to make you a treat later?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Makinami：</span><br>
You'd do that for me? Yaaay!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Haruna：</span><br>
Um, Kongou, the package?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kongou：</span><br>
Of course, I remember. First, Makinami, would you please take this and deliver it to Akashi for us?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Makinami：</span><br>
Sure thing! I'll do it right aw– Wah?! Triple-whoopsie-daisy!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Haruna：</span><br>
Whoa now, what's the hurry? Also, hasn't anyone told you not to run in the office?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Makinami：</span><br>
Oops, hehehe... Thanks for helping me up. Anyway, I'm heading out, Commander!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kongou：</span><br>
Take care. Now, Commander, we have a matter to discuss with you.<br>
...And that concludes our report. Say, Commander... how have you been faring as of late? I have heard some rather troubling things from Makinami.<br>
As for Makinami herself, as sociable as that girl is, she is prone to bouts of loneliness. You should spend more time with her when you have the chance.<br>
That is all for now. Until next time.<br>
<br>
......<br>
Kongou's right. I can't just leave her feeling anxious all the time...<br>

A Smile Goes a Mile!<br>
Port - Office<br>
Although substantial progress has been made, I'm still far from finished with all this paperwork.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Makinami：</span><br>
Hmm...<br>
<br>
And Makinami is, again, looking at me with unease...<br>
I guess it's time to take a quick break.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Makinami：</span><br>
Huh? Breaktime, already? Is that allowed?<br>
<br>
You bet. When you're in charge, you can call any time breaktime.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Makinami：</span><br>
Really? All righty!<br>
So! Give me a *hooray*! Raise those arms!<br>
<br>
A... hooray? I don't think this warrants celebration, but I decide to go along with it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Makinami：</span><br>
You're doing it wrong! When you hooray, you gotta really stretch your arms out, like *this*!<br>
Yeah, that's it! Together now! One, two...<br>
<br>
Oh snap! My guard's down and she's going for a...!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Makinami：</span><br>
Tickle surprise special!<br>
Tickle-tickle-tickle-tickle-tickle-tickle!<br>
<br>
She launches an all-out tickle assault on me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Makinami：</span><br>
Tiiiiickle-tickle-tickle-tickle-tickle!<br>
Tickle... tickle... Huh? Where's the laughter?<br>
Kiyonami would be rolling on the floor if I tickled her like this. How come it doesn't work on you?<br>
<br>
Her strategy proves ineffective. I've built up resistance from all the daily ticklings that our local pranksters subject me to. My fatigue probably plays into it as well.<br>
Anyway, Makinami is starting to look genuinely bummed out. I can't just leave her like this.<br>
I lift her into my lap, and then...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Makinami：</span><br>
Hm? Commander?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Give her a taste of her own medicine!</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Makinami：</span><br>
Ahahahahahahaha!<br>
Hahahahahah! Hey, stop! Ahahaha!<br>
I'm sorry– Ahahahaha! I won't do it again! Hahahahahah!<br>
Ahahah, hah... My mistake was underestimating you, Commander... I never took you for an expert tickler.<br>
<br>
She slumps over and rests her head against me, like she just ran out of steam.<br>
Maybe I tickled her *too* pink? Actually, no, it's fine.<br>
The relieved look on her face convinces me it did the trick.<br>

<br>
Third Time's The Charm!<br>
Port - Office<br>
All right, it's time for a break.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Makinami：</span><br>
Listen, Commander! Today's the day I'm gonna make you smile!<br>
This time, you see, I brought a secret weapon! Tadah!<br>
<br>
She produces a small wooden box out of nowhere, then places it next to my chair.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Makinami：</span><br>
There, all set up!<br>
<br>
Makinami then hops onto the little box.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Makinami：</span><br>
You just stay put like that, Commander!<br>
Heehee, I hope you're ready for this!<br>
<br>
Then it begins. She starts... patting me on the head.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Makinami：</span><br>
There, there, who's a good commander~<br>
All this work must be hard on you, huh~? A little headpatting ought to relieve some stress~<br>
<br>
......<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Makinami：</span><br>
Uhh...<br>
Huh...? You've built up resistance to *this* too?<br>
Kongou and Haruna say I look super happy and smile when they pat me like this... So why won't it work on you?<br>
I don't get it... How about you pat *me* then, Commander?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Pat her head.</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Makinami：</span><br>
Ahh, hehehe~ This feels so nice, hehehe~<br>
I love this~ Hehehe~<br>
<br>
Looks like Kongou and Haruna were totally right.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Makinami：</span><br>
Hehehe... Huh? Why'd you stop? I haven't had enough headpatting!<br>
Wait, why were you even patting my head in the first place?<br>
...Oh, right! I was trying to get you to smile, but instead *you* made *me* smile...<br>
Dang it, I failed again!<br>
<br>
Despite her failure to achieve what she set out to do, her expression is still beaming with joy from being headpatted.<br>
I'm not sure why, but it feels like seeing her smile makes some of my fatigue go away.<br>

A Beaming Smile!<br>
<br>
Come Play With Me!<br>
Port - Office<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Makinami：</span><br>
Hmm~ Hmhmhm~♪<br>
<br>
Another day, another pile of paperwork. Interestingly, though, Makinami is in a really good mood.<br>
I suppose I can play with her after I finish working on this stack.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Tell her the good news.</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Makinami：</span><br>
Really?! You'll play with me? Woohoo! Okay, I'll wait until you're done!<br>
<br>
Telling her that makes her even happier. It almost feels like ages since I last got one of her concerned glances.<br>
Finally, after countless hours slogging through this bureaucratic nightmare, its end is in sight.<br>
Now, where's Makinami?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Makinami：</span><br>
Zzzzz...<br>
<br>
I guess I took too long and the chance to play has "slept" through our fingers...<br>
I pick the sleeping Makinami up from the couch and proceed to carry her to the dormitory.<br>
I decided to give her a piggyback ride to the dormitory, as I'd feel guilty for waking her up when she's sleeping so soundly. That's when, while I'm taking her there...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Makinami：</span><br>
...*yawn*... Hmm...? Where am I? Why am I being piggybacked...?<br>
<br>
Oops. Guess I walked too fast and woke her up.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Makinami：</span><br>
You know, Commander, I still don't get it...<br>
I've been trying so hard to make you smile, but it's just not working...<br>
Kongou explained it to me like... "Sometimes, people's smiles go away for a little while. But when it eventually comes back, they'll be able to share it with all their near and dear."<br>
I hope that's true... Hey, *promise* me you'll smile again when your task is done, Commander!<br>
Mmh... I like this piggyback. Next time, I wanna be carried like a princess too...<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："I promise we'll play together once this job is done."</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Makinami：</span><br>
Yaaay! Hehehe~<br>
I feel at my happiest with a smile on my face, so... *yawn*, that's why I want you to smile too, Commander... Zzzzz...<br>
<br>
As she dozes off on my back, I imagine she has the sweetest, soundest expression in the world right now.<br>

<br>
Now, Give Me a Smile!<br>
Port - Office<br>
After many days of grueling work, I'm finally done with HQ's urgent task.<br>
Taking a refreshing look out the window, I see clear skies and a sun that feels more marvelous than usual.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Makinami：</span><br>
Commander! I'm baaack!<br>
<br>
Makinami is back from her scheduled visit to the port's docks. She looks at me, and her face lights up.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Makinami：</span><br>
Hey! You're smiling! You're smiling, Commander!<br>
Hehehe~ I'm so glad to see you back to your old self!<br>
It's time to celebrate! Hooray!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kongou：</span><br>
My word, what's the commotion this early in the morning?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Makinami：</span><br>
Oh! Good morning, Kongou, Haruna!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Haruna：</span><br>
Morning. You sure sound excited. What's up?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kongou：</span><br>
Surely you can guess, you silly goose. The Commander is able to smile once more, no?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Makinami：</span><br>
Yup! Hehehe~<br>
Now that everything's back to normal, it's time for my payback~!<br>
<br>
Payback? For what?<br>
I cast a puzzled look at Kongou and Haruna. They shake their heads, seemingly also unsure what Makinami means.<br>
In any case, I suppose I'll go along with what she wants.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Makinami：</span><br>
Hehehe... Your sides may have survived my tickle surprise special once, but this time will be different!<br>
<br>
……<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kongou：</span><br>
Ah, now I see what "payback" meant. She tried to tickle the Commander into smiling, but had the tables turned on her.<br>
In love and war, one should always be ready to return an opponent's favor, I suppose.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Haruna：</span><br>
Heh. Well, if it helped them both blow off some steam from working so much, I say what's the harm?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Makinami：</span><br>
Now hands up and give me a "hooray," Commander! I'm expecting to see a smile that'll dazzle me!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kongou：</span><br>
You wouldn't want to disappoint the young lady, Commander.<br>
<br>
Guess I've gotta make up for all the smiles I haven't shown over the past few days. But that's fine, because I'll be sharing those smiles with Makinami.<br>
