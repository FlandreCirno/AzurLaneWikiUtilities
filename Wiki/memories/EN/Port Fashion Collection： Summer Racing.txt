<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Strasbourg：</span><br>
Still not enough gas, huh...<br>
In that case...<br>
Hmm...<br>
<br>
In the pit, Strasbourg is hard at work on car maintenance.<br>
Since she's wearing headphones, she doesn't notice me approaching until I accidentally bump into the toolbox next to her.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Strasbourg：</span><br>
Oh, Commander. What brings you here right now... Did you sneak out alone?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：(Nod.)</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''I got worried when I noticed you weren't around.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Don't worry about me, though. My work is done, and my absence won't cause any problems.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Strasbourg：</span><br>
Okay... Well, I appreciate the thought.<br>
I'm just doing final checks on this car. Surely you understand why I'd worry about that, right?<br>
<br>
Her purple irises focus on me. I see a teasing glint in them.<br>
I shake my head, pick up the toolbox on the floor, and squat down next to her.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Let me help. Two sets of hands are better than one.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Strasbourg：</span><br>
Really? Just so you know, if you wanna help me...<br>
That means staying right by my side. Focusing only on me and our work.<br>
Yeah. Think about nothing but me, look at nothing but me...<br>
<br>
She squeezes my sleeve tight.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Strasbourg：</span><br>
Your time is all mine now, Commander...<br>
Now... Let's get to work, shall we?<br>
<br>
Strasbourg and I efficiently knock out task after task.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Strasbourg：</span><br>
Phew. I'd say that does it for that. Thanks for helping me out.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Don't mention it. Say, why didn't you ask any of the others for help?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Strasbourg：</span><br>
...Because it's a job I can do alone.<br>
<br>
Her answer sounds a little prickly. Throughout, she continues her work.<br>
While she does that, she notices a screw on the ground.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Strasbourg：</span><br>
.........<br>
<br>
She deftly swipes it up and screws it back where it belongs, all without a word.<br>
Awkward silence hangs over us.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Strasbourg：</span><br>
...Do you think I'm acting tough, or something?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Not at all. It's impressive that you can handle all of this alone.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Strasbourg：</span><br>
Honestly, I wanted you to see how capable I am. But I messed it up.<br>
<br>
We're so close that our skin gently touches. I can feel her warmth.<br>
So close that the air between us feels like it's heating up.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Strasbourg：</span><br>
It doesn't matter, though.<br>
When I'm with you, I don't need to act tough or pretend I'm someone who I'm not.<br>
As long as you keep what's happened between us today a secret...<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：(Nod.)</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Strasbourg：</span><br>
Heheh, good. Okay, next...<br>
<br>
After getting the answer she wants, she gets ready to stand up.<br>
But perhaps as a result of squatting for so long, she loses balance as soon as she tries to straighten her legs.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Strasbourg：</span><br>
Hyah!<br>
<br>
I reach my arm around and catch her before she can fall.<br>
She's fully in my arms now, at my mercy.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Strasbourg：</span><br>
Thank you...<br>
<br>
Yet she relaxes and even leans in closer.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Strasbourg：</span><br>
Don't move. Keep hugging me, just like you are now.<br>
If you let go... I might fall, you know. Heehee.<br>
<br>
My skin starts to burn hot, and the girl in my arms whispers into my ear.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Strasbourg：</span><br>
You know, Commander, it's just the two of us... What if we took things a little bit further?<br>
We still have pleeenty of time...<br>

<br>
After a full day of intensive work, the car's test runs are finally complete.<br>
While final checks occur, I try to get out of the car. I'm stopped by a tapping on the windshield.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Hm? Who's that?)<br>
<br>
I turn around and see a fighting angel of the Iris on all fours on the hood of the car, palms and chest pressed firmly against the windshield.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Joffre?</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：Careful. The hood's gotta be hot right now.</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Joffre：</span><br>
Don't worry about me. The engine is off now... and I'm just fine.<br>
You look surprised. Have I caught you in the middle of violating some kind of rule?<br>
Heehee. The Commander I know would never do such a thing, I'm sure.<br>
Otherwise, I wouldn't get to just sit here and watch you, now, would I?<br>
But... I can't help but notice your eyes darting back and forth.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
That's, uhh...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Joffre：</span><br>
Go on.<br>
<br>
Her lips curl up softly, as if excited to hear my poor excuse.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：You're just so dazzling, y'know...</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：I just didn't expect you there.</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Even moreso than the sun itself.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Joffre：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Aww, Commander... Heehee. Do you mean to say I got in the way of your driving? Is that it?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''You came out of nowhere, so it startled me a little.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Joffre：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''We call that a "surprise," Commander.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Joffre：</span><br>
...An obvious lie, but I won't pass judgment for that alone.<br>
<br>
She relaxes her arms a little and leans fully on the windshield.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Joffre：</span><br>
That look on your face tells me you have questions for me.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Yeah, well... Maybe.<br>
The race hasn't started. Why are you here?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Joffre：</span><br>
Heehee. Why, indeed...<br>
<br>
The fighting angel closes her eyes in apparent prayer.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Joffre：</span><br>
Right now, you're doing everything you can for the sake of your victory.<br>
It's only natural for an angel of the Iris to offer a blessing to you.<br>
Not judgment, but a blessing known as love.<br>
<br>
She blows onto the windshield, causing some of it to fog up.<br>
Then, she draws a cute little heart with wings on it with her finger.<br>
My finger brushes against the glass where hers is, but I'm brought back to reality by the hardness of it.<br>
She smiles briefly at me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Joffre：</span><br>
Commander, could you open the door for me, please?<br>
<br>
Under the blue sky, the angel symbolizing victory shines brighter than the sun.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Joffre：</span><br>
Before the race, let me give you a blessing known as certain victory.<br>

<br>
The day's races end. All that remains is the award ceremony.<br>
When I step out of the pit, my eyes are first drawn to a pennant blowing in the breeze–and then to U-96.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-96：</span><br>
Yo. Over here, Commander.<br>
<br>
She smiles brightly and pats the seat next to her, beckoning me to approach.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-96：</span><br>
I saw the moment your car crossed the finish line. You gonna crack open some champagne on the first-place podium?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Well, there's still time until the ceremony. I was thinking of taking a walk to clear my mind a little.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-96：</span><br>
Uh-huh? Well, you were cool as hell today, Commander. I knew you'd take first.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：You knew?</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：What if I lost?</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Well, thank you for your bid of confidence. Were you that certain?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-96：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Course I was. You're my Commander, after all.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-96：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''I'd figure it out on the spot. Probably cheer ya up and wait for your next victory.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-96：</span><br>
Besides, you'd never betray my expectations. No shot.<br>
You're the whole reason I came to cheer at this event, anyway.<br>
Argh, enough of that! Is it hot, or what?<br>
<br>
The dazzling sun scorches the earth, heedless of our suffering. We can't stay in its burning rays for too long.<br>
It's so hot, in fact, that I realize that I can see the air distorting over the racetrack.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-96：</span><br>
Wanna go cool down, or somethin'?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
How about the pit? The AC in there feels great.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-96：</span><br>
Oh, first... Stay still for me a sec.<br>
*mwah*<br>
<br>
A soft sensation touches my cheek, accompanied by hot breath.<br>
The goddess of victory, wielding her flag in hand, has bequeathed me with a kiss.<br>
Apparently bashful for once, U-96 looks away a little. From this angle, it looks like she's blushing.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-96：</span><br>
What, are you just gonna stare at me now? That was just your prize.<br>
Your muscles must be stiff from all that driving, right? Someone's gonna have to give ya a massage.<br>
Besides... We've got time before the ceremony.<br>
I'll treat you for winning first place. In return, you gotta reward ME for all the work I did cheering you on.<br>
Alright! Let's goooo!<br>
