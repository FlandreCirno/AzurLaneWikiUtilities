<span style="color:#4eb24e;">??? (Edinburgh)：</span><br>
Zzzzz...<br>
Ugh... It's pitch dark... Did I fall asleep?<br>
*Yawn*... What time is it...?<br>
I've been so busy though... with work, and with Her Majesty's tea party... I think I've earned myself some rest...<br>
The Commander probably is slacking off too... And if anything happens, I'm sure Bel will wake me up...<br>
Maybe I'll sleep in a bit more...<br>
Four respondents randomly select one option in a questionnaire with three options: A, B, and C. What's the probability that A, B, and C all appear in the responses?<br>
Any takers? Who wants to take a crack at this question?<br>
<br>
That voice... is so grating...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">??? (Edinburgh)：</span><br>
Edinburgh...! Edinburgh...! Are you sleeping in class again?<br>
Wow...<br>
Hehe. I like the free-spirited type, but you missed the part where you're not supposed to get caught by the teacher~<br>
<br>
Stop shaking me around... I don't wanna get up...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">??? (Edinburgh)：</span><br>
Edinburgh! How many times have I told you not to sleep in class?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Edinburgh：</span><br>
...*yaaaawn*... Wh-where am I...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">A Teacher? (Purity)：</span><br>
In class, silly. Now, once again, please answer the question on the board.<br>
Four respondents randomly select one option in a questionnaire with three options: A, B, and C. What's the probability that A, B, and C all appear in the responses?<br>

Ahem! That's right. Even if you stayed up late studying, try to manage your time better so you don't keep falling asleep in class. You can sit back down.<br>
Now let's move on to the next lesson...<br>
<br>
Ugh... Another long day of classes...<br>
Compared to my smart and hard-working classmates, I'm just...<br>
...Are classes really that interesting for them?<br>
...And what in the world was I doing last night? I'm still so sleepy...<br>
Can't even remember a thing... But, whatever... Might as well go back to sleep...<br>
「Zzz…………」<br>

Ding–– Dong–– Ding–– Dong––<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">A Teacher?：</span><br>
Go and enjoy lunch, everyone. Don't eat too much and pass out during the afternoon classes though~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Everyone：</span><br>
Thanks, Miss Purity!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yume Minami：</span><br>
Phew, finally some fresh air... Edinburgh, are you alright? You seemed kinda out of it earlier.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Edinburgh：</span><br>
Oh, um, I was just spacing out.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Why'd you stay up so late when we barely even had any homework? Wait, a new game?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Edinburgh：</span><br>
Ugh... Busted again...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akane Shinjo：</span><br>
Haha, you're so easy to read, Edinburgh. Hehe, was it so addicting you couldn't sleep all night?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Edinburgh：</span><br>
Not really? To be honest, I can't exactly remember... Oh, shoot! I forgot to pack my lunch!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Seriously? How many times does that make it now?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Roon：</span><br>
If you forgot your lunch, you're always welcome to have some of mine~ I packed enough to share~♪<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Edinburgh：</span><br>
Woah, you're a lifesaver, Roon!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Roon：</span><br>
Don't mention it! That's what friends are for~ Here, this is for you. Why don't we go eat with the Com––<br>
.........<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Edinburgh：</span><br>
What's wrong, Roon?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Roon：</span><br>
...Huh, that's weird. What was I doing just now...?<br>
I'm forgetting something very important... Something I was always doing at lunch... Was I supposed to meet someone? ...Who?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Huh? Don't we always eat lunch together?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Roon：</span><br>
No, no... NO! What the hell is this feeling...?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Rikka Takarada：</span><br>
Are you feeling sick? Should I take you to the nurse's office?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Edinburgh：</span><br>
Woah, she ran off. Should we go after her...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akane Shinjo：</span><br>
Yeah, I'm a bit worried... Be right back, I'll go check on her!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Edinburgh：</span><br>
Akane...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Rikka Takarada：</span><br>
Wait, Akane? Sorry to bail on you, but I'm going after her as well!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Edinburgh：</span><br>
And there she goes as well...<br>
Wonder if she got an upset stomach... Well, whatever. Let's enjoy some lunch while there's still time!<br>
Working hard in class has gotten me all peckish––<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
More like, working hard to fall asleep in class.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Edinburgh：</span><br>
Hey, it's not my fault that showing up to class drains my stamina! Not everyone is a natural student like you, Memphis.<br>
Yeah... Kicking back during break time definitely beats sitting in class...<br>

<br>
Ding–– Dong–– Ding–– Dong––<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Akane and Roon still haven't come back yet?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Rikka Takarada：</span><br>
They're not responding to my text messages either... Ugh, I'm going to go look for them!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Purity：</span><br>
Just what do you take Miss Purity for? Get back in your seats right now!<br>
Kids these days... Showing up to class only when they want to, and thinking they can leave whenever they want!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yume Minami：</span><br>
Miss Purity, I think that's a bit harsh...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Purity：</span><br>
Oh... You do have a point, but that's also besides the point! Class is in session, NOW!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Edinburgh：</span><br>
(Miss Purity is certainly unique for a teacher... I wonder how she even ended up teaching...)<br>
(Ugh... I'm getting all sleepy again...)<br>
<br>
Just as she closed her eyes and went to lay down on the desk, she was jolted awake by the vibrating of her phone.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Edinburgh：</span><br>
A message from... Hiryuu? Isn't she supposed to be in the middle of P.E.?<br>
...What? I never expected Hiryuu to be the type to cut class...<br>
...Wooooah?! What in the world––!!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Purity：</span><br>
Do you have something to share with the class, Miss Edinburgh?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Edinburgh：</span><br>
Y-yeah, just look at this picture!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Purity：</span><br>
Don't play on your phone during class!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Edinburgh：</span><br>
I'm not playing around! Look!<br>
<br>
The picture was taken from the side of the schoolyard facing the ocean, the water clearly visible. But within it––<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Purity：</span><br>
What the hell is that? From that distance, it must be the size of a skyscraper!!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
It's kinda blurry from here, but... is that the silhouette of a dinosaur?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Edinburgh：</span><br>
There's no way that's real, right? Do huge creatures like that even exist?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
What are those smaller things around it? I... I've never seen anything like it...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Rikka Takarada：</span><br>
That... has to be some kind of kaiju.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Kaiju? What's that?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Rikka Takarada：</span><br>
Um... How do I explain this...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yume Minami：</span><br>
(The kaiju have appeared again...!)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Edinburgh：</span><br>
We can't see it from here! Let's head outside to take a look!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Purity：</span><br>
Hold on, that's dangerous!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Edinburgh：</span><br>
If these kaiju things are real, it's going to be more dangerous to stay inside!<br>
<br>
––At that time, the emergency sirens began to blare.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">School Broadcast：</span><br>
An emergency has occurred! Everyone in the school, please evacuate to the gymnasium as quickly as possible!<br>
Once again, an emergency has occurred! Everyone in the school, please evacuate to the gymnasium as quickly as possible!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Edinburgh：</span><br>
Come on, teach! You heard them, it's dangerous to stay here!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Purity：</span><br>
Ugh... Fine, fine! Everyone, follow me in an orderly fashion and evacuate to the gym!<br>
Rikka, Yume! Get back here! Don't go running off during an emergency!!<br>

<br>
The group hurried down the hallway toward the gym.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yume Minami：</span><br>
That's strange... No matter how hard I look for it, I can't find it! I know I had it this morning...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Edinburgh：</span><br>
Yume, what are looking for?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yume Minami：</span><br>
Dyna, err... I mean, I dropped something earlier...<br>
(If I can't find it, I won't be able to fight the kaiju...)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Edinburgh：</span><br>
What? Fight...? I think you should just leave that to the pros.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Purity：</span><br>
She's right! The people in the town will be able to think up some countermeasures! In the meantime, we should hurry up and evacuate!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yume Minami：</span><br>
You're not wrong, but if there's anything I can do to help...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Edinburgh：</span><br>
Look, who's that person out there...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Rikka Takarada：</span><br>
Huh, no way! Who'd be outside at a time like this?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Someone from the next town over?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Rikka Takarada：</span><br>
I don't think so... Now that I'm looking closely... is that person walking towards us WITH the kaiju?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yume Minami：</span><br>
I'm going to grab my phone and zoom in for a closer look! ...Wow, you're right, there really is someone there!<br>
Wait... is that... Mujina?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Edinburgh：</span><br>
Someone you know?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yume Minami：</span><br>
Uh... Kind of, we've got some history between us...<br>
So, Mujina and the kaiju show up at the same time... Are the Kaiju Eugenicists up to something again?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Kaiju Eugenicists...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yume Minami：</span><br>
It's a bit hard to describe, but... to put it simply, they're people who want to let kaiju run rampant, or something along those lines.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
W-what kind of evil organization is that? Almost sounds like something right out of those shows Ryuujou watches...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yume Minami：</span><br>
Yeah, that's a natural reaction to have...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Purity：</span><br>
What are you loitering around for?! Let's hurry on up to the evacuation site already! The giant kaiju is just around the corner!<br>
You too, Rikka! Hurry up, or we're going to leave you behind!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Rikka Takarada：</span><br>
But... Akane still hasn't come back...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Purity：</span><br>
I'm sure she's already made it somewhere safe. It'd be impossible not to hear the blaring sirens after all.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yume Minami：</span><br>
Why would a kaiju appear right here though? I thought we already defeated them all the last time...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
...Last time?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Purity：</span><br>
Defeated the what? Are kids these days still into that roleplaying stuff even at your age?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Edinburgh：</span><br>
Why don't you try calling Akane? We're not in the middle of class right now, so we can use our phones, right?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Purity：</span><br>
You were already using your phone during class earlier! Why bother asking for permission now?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Rikka Takarada：</span><br>
You're right. Hold on for a second, let me call her—<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=Ready,Fire!|选项=5|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Rikka Takarada：</span><br>
Oh, it went through.<br>
Hello? Akane? Where are you?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akane Shinjo：</span><br>
Rikka? Don't worry~ I've got the kaiju in check.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Edinburgh：</span><br>
In check... What does she mean by that?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Rikka Takarada：</span><br>
Huh? What do you mean? I don't get you at all.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akane Shinjo：</span><br>
The kaiju was headed towards the school, so I stopped it in its tracks~ But wow, I never thought I'd be able to see such an amazing kaiju, hehe.<br>
Did you know? Roon's rigging is super awesome!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Roon? Rigging...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akane Shinjo：</span><br>
Are you listening~? Her main battery's ready to fire, she's about to blow!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Rikka Takarada：</span><br>
Um, as I was saying, what exactly a...<br>
<br>
BOOOOOOM!!!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Rikka Takarada：</span><br>
Wha?! What was that sound?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akane Shinjo：</span><br>
So, did you hear it~? Front row seats to a concerto of cannonfire!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
She's right! The kaiju's stopped moving!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Roon：</span><br>
Ahahahaha! Anyone who gets in my way... will be torn apart!!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Rikka Takarada：</span><br>
Is that... Roon? Did she really manage to stop that thing?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akane Shinjo：</span><br>
Yup. She made some kaiju-esque "rigging" or something appear, and it packs an insane punch! It also seems to be automated!<br>
People change when they're thrust into battle. It's sooooo fascinating!<br>
Anyway, like I said, there's no need for you to worry about me~ I'll wrap things up over here.<br>
Just head to some place safe and wait for me there, okay?<br>
Kay, well, I'm hanging up now. Hey, Roon! Can you do that one more time?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Rikka Takarada：</span><br>
She hung up... I have no idea what's going on, but she seems to be doing... just fine?<br>

<br>
School — Schoolyard<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Roon... It's you, right?<br>
What's with that iron dragon...? Huh, a kaiju? Rigging...? Did you use the rigging to fight the kaiju?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yume Minami：</span><br>
(There are various types of kaiju, so... I wonder if there are kaiju that can become our partners...?)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Edinburgh：</span><br>
Roon, did you partner up with a kaiju?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Roon：</span><br>
Of course not. This is just my rigging.<br>
I had a feeling something was wrong. You've all forgotten something important... and the fact that you don't even recognize my rigging confirms that.<br>
Does it jog your memory when I say the word, "shipgirls?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Ship... girls? Like, sailors?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Edinburgh：</span><br>
Like, warships...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Roon：</span><br>
Guess that wasn't enough. Then, how about "Port," and "Commander"?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Port? Commander? Hrmm...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Edinburgh：</span><br>
Commander... THE Commander! Oh!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Roon：</span><br>
Hehehe, I guess "Commander" carries a lot of power.<br>
We aren't a group of schoolgirls. We're shipgirls, born to fight against the Sirens.<br>
Edinburgh, light cruiser of the Royal Navy, and Memphis, light cruiser of the Eagle Union.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
...That's right! How did we forget something so important...?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Edinburgh：</span><br>
So that's why I couldn't remember anything about the game I played last night! How were you able to figure all this out, Roon?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Roon：</span><br>
I wonder... Earlier today, during lunch... I felt that there was a hole in my heart, and that hole only continued to grow.<br>
I came to realize that what I had been missing so sorely... was the Commander. After I remembered that, the other pieces quickly fell back into place.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
We were in the process of investigating a Mirror Sea, and then before we knew it... we ended up here.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Edinburgh：</span><br>
I wish Bel was here... I can't even make heads or tails of this situation.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Well, there's no need to panic. Let's put our heads together and figure out how to get out of this mess.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Roon：</span><br>
Hehehe... So I'm not good enough?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Edinburgh：</span><br>
I'm glad you're here too R-Roon! Let's do our best!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yume Minami：</span><br>
Umm... Is there something I'm missing out on here? What's this Mirror Sea and shipgirl stuff you've been talking about?<br>
Are we not just ordinary classmates?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Roon：</span><br>
You should ask your friend over there. She's the one who can tell you what's really going on~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Rikka Takarada：</span><br>
Akane...? Is there something you haven't been telling us? What's going on?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akane Shinjo：</span><br>
I guess there is, but I've somewhat been duped myself. So, it all began when I got a proposal––<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=AMysteriousInvitation|选项=7|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akane Shinjo：</span><br>
So it went like this... a few days ago while we were on break, I was sleeping at home. If I remember correctly, Rikka...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Rikka Takarada：</span><br>
Ahh, I remember now! I went to the plaza, and then...<br>
When I came to, I was in class as usual... So why were we...<br>
I can't quite remember... It feels like there are holes in my memory...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yume Minami：</span><br>
Now that you mention it... My head's felt a bit foggy lately...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Edinburgh：</span><br>
A few days? Everything feels like it's happened within the last day for me... But I guess that's all relative.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akane Shinjo：</span><br>
We're from different worlds after all. It's not unthinkable that time might pass differently for us~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Rikka Takarada：</span><br>
So Akane, is this world your doing?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akane Shinjo：</span><br>
Sadly, nope. But unlike the rest of you, who were pulled in without your knowledge, I was invited here.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Rikka Takarada：</span><br>
...By who?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akane Shinjo：</span><br>
Uhh... Some people who had all this super cool giant mecha gear?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Wait, that sounds just like... the Sirens?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akane Shinjo：</span><br>
Oh yeah, that! That's what they called themselves. Seemed like they aren't living beings, but rather some kind of AI?<br>
Those Sirens created this entire space. It reminds me a bit of how I used to create kaijus back then.<br>
So basically, I have nothing to do with whoever made this world, nor am I some kind of god here.<br>
Even so, I came here of my own accord. I wanted to be a normal human, living out a normal life.<br>
Oh, woe... They weren't even able to make my dreams come true...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Whatever this "proposal" was, they clearly weren't forthcoming with Akane either.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akane Shinjo：</span><br>
Yeah! This isn't the normal life I was promised at all!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Edinburgh：</span><br>
Yep. Just as you would expect from the Sirens.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yume Minami：</span><br>
Umm, I think I get the gist of what's going on.<br>
But if that's the case, why is Mujina here? Did she also get an invitation from these Sirens?<br>
I could see them offering her something like "a world where kaiju still exist," or something like that...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Edinburgh：</span><br>
I thought kaijus were the enemies in your world though? But I guess there are always people out there who like having enemies around...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yume Minami：</span><br>
That's... the opposite of what the Kaiju Eugenicists believe...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akane Shinjo：</span><br>
Sorry, but I can only speak for myself. Wouldn't be able to tell you what's going on with her.<br>
If she was invited here by the Sirens just like me, then she's most likely being deceived as well.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Edinburgh：</span><br>
Well, anything is possible with the Sirens, so... Ahh, w-wait a minute! The teacher in our class was... was...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yume Minami：</span><br>
Miss Purity?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Yes, her! She's actually Purifier, one of the Sirens' higher-ups! I knew it, they've had someone watching us this whole time!<br>
Wait, Akane, if you knew all that, why didn't you just tell us?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akane Shinjo：</span><br>
Because it's more fun that way, heehee~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Rikka Takarada：</span><br>
Uhh...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Edinburgh：</span><br>
Purifier should be at the gym right now! Let's hurry there and reassess the situation!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Roon：</span><br>
While we're checking on Purifier, we should also find the other shipgirls around the school and let them know what's going on.<br>
And our friends from another world as well~♪<br>

School—Clinic<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Namiko：</span><br>
Aaand welcome to the clinic~! We made it through the crisis unharmed. Hooray!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hass：</span><br>
Say cheese! Let's snap a quick pic of this touching reunion!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Rikka Takarada：</span><br>
Hass! Namiko! You guys are here too?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Namiko：</span><br>
Did you hit your head, Rikka? We were with you this morning!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hass：</span><br>
Well, we're not in the same class, but still. We went to the plaza together before we came to school!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Rikka Takarada：</span><br>
Now that you mention it... Wait, how is that possible? I'm so confused...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ryuujou：</span><br>
There's no need to rush, Rikka! Now that we're onto the Sirens' tricks, we just need some time to sort out our memories.<br>
At least, I'm glad that I remember all my friends from the Port!<br>
I can't believe I let myself get fooled by these cheap illusions though... Who knows what would've happened to me if you girls weren't here!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Rikka Takarada：</span><br>
By the way, why are the two of you at the clinic? Did you get hurt?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Namiko：</span><br>
Nothin' but a scratch! It's all Hass's fault, too. She was throwing a fit, saying she was HAD to go take some pictures of the kaiju.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hass：</span><br>
Well yeah, who'd pass up a chance like that?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Rikka Takarada：</span><br>
Just... don't push your luck like that. Next time, safety first. Got it?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hass：</span><br>
My bad, my bad~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
And then you ran into Ryuujou?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Namiko：</span><br>
Yep. She brought us over to the clinic.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Edinburgh：</span><br>
Ryuujou's sense of justice really comes from her soul, huh? She went out of her way to look after you two and brought you to the clinic while not even realizing that she's a shipgirl. That's incredible.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ryuujou：</span><br>
Protecting the weak is the duty of a warrior such as I!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Namiko：</span><br>
Thanks to Ryuujou, we were able to make it here safely. After getting patched up, we were just about to leave, and that's when all of you showed up.<br>
Yup. And after hearing Akane tell me what's going on, my memories started to come back as well.<br>
Oh, right. The Purifier that's calling herself Miss Purity? She's being held over here.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Edinburgh：</span><br>
What?! You managed to capture a Siren?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ryuujou：</span><br>
It's a long story, but basically...<br>

Clinic<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Purity：</span><br>
Students these days are the worst! I can't believe they'd lock their teacher up!<br>
Ugh! You dare do this to your teacher just because we had a bit of an incident? And what do you plan on doing next now that I can't do anything about it?<br>
...The sheer indignity of it all!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
What in the world is going on...? Why's she talking like her memories still haven't come back?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Edinburgh：</span><br>
How strange... Can Sirens be fooled by their own illusions?<br>
Mentioning the Commander helped us regain our memories, but what would stir a Siren's memory?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
God knows what. Besides, what if she already got her memories back?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ryuujou：</span><br>
It's possible... but this Purifier is nothing like the vicious beast that we know.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Roon：</span><br>
I've got an idea. Memphis, why don't you feed her a bit of our knowledge?<br>
Starting from the time the Sirens first appeared in our world...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Purity：</span><br>
So, Sirens are the bad guys?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ryuujou：</span><br>
That's right! That's why we're keeping you on a leash, Purifier!<br>
Now, tell us how to escape from this Mirror Sea already!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Purity：</span><br>
...I kind of have a liiiiittle inkling in the back of my mind, but it's really faint still~<br>
Putting that aside, isn't your enemy Purifier? What does that have to do with me?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Namiko：</span><br>
She might have a point. The Purifier you were talking about and the Purity in front of us sound pretty different.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Edinburgh：</span><br>
That's certainly plausible...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akane Shinjo：</span><br>
Or, maybe she's acting. Hehe.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
There's no way she's not acting. She sucks at it too.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hass：</span><br>
But see, if I'm really as awesome and powerful as this Purifier person you keep talking about, do you think I'd still be sitting here helplessly?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ryuujou：</span><br>
Hrmmm...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hass：</span><br>
What do you think, Rikka?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Rikka Takarada：</span><br>
Hmm... At least, I don't think she's lying. Maybe she's just a lookalike?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yume Minami：</span><br>
She doesn't seem to pose any threat to us right now. Wouldn't it be fine to leave her alone...?<br>
Oh, I just got a message from Chise.<br>
"I saw that there was an explosion at the school. Is everyone okay?"<br>
Wait a sec, that means Chise's here too...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Edinburgh：</span><br>
Is she one of your friends?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yume Minami：</span><br>
Yeah. My guess is that she was roped into this situation, just like us.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ryuujou：</span><br>
There are probably more people who were roped into this situation. Let's hurry up and find them!<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hass：</span><br>
So laaaame. We're being left out of the fun.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Namiko：</span><br>
I want to head out and have some fun, too!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akane Shinjo：</span><br>
Well, can't really do anything about that. We can't fight, so we'd just be putting ourselves in danger.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Rikka Takarada：</span><br>
Akane, is there really nothing you can do over here?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akane Shinjo：</span><br>
Sad, but true.<br>
But... Purity. Are you really a Siren?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Purity：</span><br>
Am I a Siren just because you think I'm one~?<br>
Seriously though, I never knew I did all those bad things in the past...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akane Shinjo：</span><br>
Okay stoooop. This isn't your pity party. Anyway, as I was saying...<br>
If you're really one of the Sirens' higher-ups, you can do what the Sirens promised they could do, right~?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Purity：</span><br>
Probably~♪<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Rikka Takarada：</span><br>
Wait, Akane! You can't be serious––<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akane Shinjo：</span><br>
Hehehe, this is about to get a whole lot more interesting~<br>
This way, we should be able to fight as well. Right~?<br>
Show me what you can do with this special rigging, won't you? Miss Purity~<br>

School—Auditorium<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ryuujou：</span><br>
I've finished making my rounds! I think we've found all the shipgirls at this school.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Souryuu：</span><br>
I can't believe... that I was fooled by the Sirens...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hiryuu：</span><br>
You're on the disciplinary committee, and I'm a delinquent... This setting makes no sense...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kasumi：</span><br>
I was in the occult club... the only members were Foo and me... and the club was on the verge of being disbanded...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hermione ：</span><br>
I was a nurse in the clinic... It felt a bit weird, because I didn't have my maid clothes. Hehe.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Edinburgh：</span><br>
Huh? Thinking back, you weren't at the clinic when we were there, were you, Hermione?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hermione ：</span><br>
I was busy evacuating with Spee. She must be looking for a way to get in touch with the port.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Edinburgh：</span><br>
Those damn Sirens made up so many weird character settings... I was even falling asleep in the middle of class!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hiryuu：</span><br>
In your case, weren't you just doing what you normally would have done?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Edinburgh：</span><br>
There's no way in heck that's true!!!<br>
This is as good a time as any! Bel's not around, so it's the perfect time for me to change my image!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Souryuu：</span><br>
Sure, we'll leave you to it. As for the others who ended up in this world...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chise Asukagawa：</span><br>
I'm Chise Asukagawa! It's nice to meet you!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hiryuu：</span><br>
You're the girl we ran into earlier.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Souryuu：</span><br>
Or, more precisely, she's the girl I ran into when I was looking for Hiryuu.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yume Minami：</span><br>
So that's how they set it up... the Sirens are terrifying.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Edinburgh：</span><br>
That's how they set it up? What? Why are you treating them differently from me! What's up with that?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Roon：</span><br>
Hehehe. You did it, Purifier.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akane Shinjo：</span><br>
Ta-daaah! This guy here is Alexis Crisis! Isn't he amazing~!!!<br>
Purity designed him based on the information I gave her~<br>
You're amazing, Purity~!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Purity：</span><br>
Ahah! Yes, praise me more! Do it!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yume Minami：</span><br>
Sorry for doing my own thing... But even if the current situation has nothing to do with us, I don't want to sit around like a caged songbird, relying on others to protect me.<br>
It's not like our combat force is massive, so I wanted to join the fight on my own terms...<br>
That's why I gave Purity the designs for Dyna Wing and Dyna Rex... but, I never thought she'd really be able to pull it off.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Purity：</span><br>
Don't underestimate the power of Miss Purity!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Rikka Takarada：</span><br>
Hass, Namiko, and I didn't really have an image in mind when we talked to Miss Purity, so we left it to her. I was glad that they came out better than we had hoped. Gridman... You sure bring back memories.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hass：</span><br>
Rikka told me that mine was designed after Max and Samurai?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Namiko：</span><br>
And mine looks like Borr and Vit or something! ...Not that I know what that is!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hass&Namiko：</span><br>
So cool!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Purity：</span><br>
Super cool!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Roon：</span><br>
Weird... Even if you are a Siren, how are you able to reproduce things you've never seen with such fidelity, just from hearing descriptions of them?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Purity：</span><br>
Uhh...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Roon：</span><br>
Hehehe. There must be a model for them somewhere, no? Tell me the truth already~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Purity：</span><br>
Hol'up! I'll tell you, so don't shove me in your rigging's mouth!<br>
To tell you the truth, I don't know how, but I had access to some kind of database... and I used that data to create these riggings.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Roon：</span><br>
What an amazing power you have~ Why don't you tell us what else you can see?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Purity：</span><br>
Things like the location of the Mirror Sea's control mechanism, and the structure of this town––<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Roon：</span><br>
You will tell me, yes?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Purity：</span><br>
Y-yes...<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akane Shinjo：</span><br>
Everyone's gone, huh.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Rikka Takarada：</span><br>
When I was walking to school this morning, the town was still full of people... What happened...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Roon：</span><br>
The Sirens probably decided that it's not worth the effort to keep up the illusions anymore.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Edinburgh：</span><br>
And, that "Mujina" person is out there somewhere.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chise Asukagawa：</span><br>
Oh! That reminds me, I saw a familiar face on my way over here!<br>
Who do you think it was?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yume Minami：</span><br>
Mujina?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chise Asukagawa：</span><br>
Eh? How'd you know?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Roon：</span><br>
I guess you were pretty far away when the kaiju appeared.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chise Asukagawa：</span><br>
Oh, so that was the kaiju you defeated earlier?<br>
But, I saw her before all that happened! And, she was wearing some kind of weird gear... Now that I think about it, it looked kinda like the rigging we have on now!<br>
She was rushing towards the beach... and she looked pretty agitated.<br>
If you asked me, it didn't look like she was off to dominate some kaiju...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
In other words, the Sirens "promised" her something, just like with Akane... They must've made her rigging as well.<br>
But we won't know for sure until we ask her in person...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Souryuu：</span><br>
Until Purifier gets her memories back, we can only pray for more information about who the mastermind behind all this is.<br>
On the other hand, we can't just leave the situation as it is, particularly when someone from another world is involved.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Edinburgh：</span><br>
Ugh, I'm getting exhausted just from thinking about all this...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akane Shinjo：</span><br>
You're welcome to take a nap on my rigging if you're tired~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Edinburgh：</span><br>
That's alright... After all, today's gonna be the day I prove my worth to Bel!<br>

Town - East Sector<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
The illusion of the town is disappearing... It's gradually reverting into a regular old island.<br>
I guess the Sirens decided they don't need to keep up the guise anymore.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yume Minami：</span><br>
These Sirens are an awfully pragmatic bunch, huh? Masks off the moment they get discovered.<br>
I've never seen anything like this though. With the disguise peeled back, it feels like we're actually stepping into cyberspace...<br>
The fact that the school is still staying intact makes it seem all that much more surreal...<br>
It's like I'm getting a glimpse into the "reality" of this world...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ryuujou：</span><br>
Hold on, don't just go around touching things randomly!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yume Minami：</span><br>
Huh? Isn't this just a normal brick wall?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ryuujou：</span><br>
You never know when it comes to the Sirens. Even ordinary things can be inlaid with alien dangers.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yume Minami：</span><br>
...I see. You did say you've been fighting against the Sirens for a long, long time.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Kind of? They kinda showed up out of nowhere in our world as well.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yume Minami：</span><br>
So they just appeared suddenly and started attacking with no rhyme or reason? That... sounds a lot like the kaiju.<br>
Oh, Ryuujou, is that an airplane that's been flying around above us?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ryuujou：</span><br>
Yup, that's a carrier-based aircraft, designed specifically for use by aircraft carriers. Some cruisers are able to launch seaplanes, and that's a different class of–<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yume Minami：</span><br>
So, does that mean I get to use them too?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ryuujou：</span><br>
Hmm... It seems that the rigging Purifier made for you has no ability to launch carrier-based aircraft.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yume Minami：</span><br>
I see... I guess I have to get used to fighting on the surface then.<br>
What if... Hey, Ryuujou, do you think you'd be able to give me a ride on one of your planes?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ryuujou：</span><br>
No way!<br>

Souryuu-senpai! Hiryuu-senpai! Where are we headed next?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Souryuu：</span><br>
Hmm, let's see... Let's head down to the beach while surveying our surroundings.<br>
Since that giant kaiju emerged from the sea and then vanished back into the sea, it has to be hiding somewhere.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chise Asukagawa：</span><br>
That makes sense! You really are super smart, Souryuu-senpai!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Souryuu：</span><br>
I wouldn't say that. This was just some basic deductive reasoning.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chise Asukagawa：</span><br>
No, no, you've been amazing this whole time, Souryuu-senpai! All this tactics and strategy stuff goes straight over my head!<br>
Also, Hiryuu-senpai's able to do so many cool maneuvers with her planes! I've only seen formations like that in movies!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hiryuu：</span><br>
Ahaha, thank you!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Souryuu：</span><br>
So, what's with this "senpai" thing you've been calling us?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chise Asukagawa：</span><br>
Back where I'm from, it's a title used for someone older than you who you look up to. You saved me when I was in a pinch, and there's so much I can learn from you. Does it bother you?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Souryuu：</span><br>
I suppose that makes sense...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hiryuu：</span><br>
Don't sweat it. Didn't I see you grinning with delight just a moment ago, Souryuu?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Souryuu：</span><br>
{namecode:94}————<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hiryuu：</span><br>
So... Chise. You used to fight battles back in your own world, right? What kind of battles were they?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chise Asukagawa：</span><br>
Well, you see... At first, I rode on Dyna Soldier in order to fight, but that didn't work out very well...<br>
And then I went through some intensive training. Now, I fight with my buddy, Goldburn!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hiryuu：</span><br>
Goldburn? Are you talking about your rigging?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chise Asukagawa：</span><br>
Well you see, this is just a replica of him that Purity made based on my instructions.<br>
The real deal is a lot bigger, stronger, and cooler!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Souryuu：</span><br>
I see... since you said there aren't Sirens or shipgirls in your world, is he a type of kaiju...?<br>
So, some kaiju are your enemies, but not all of them?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chise Asukagawa：</span><br>
Goldburn isn't just any old kaiju. He has a heart, and we can understand each other... He's my buddy who fights by my side.<br>
He's even saved Yume in the past.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hiryuu：</span><br>
He has a heart? I suppose that makes him different from the other kaiju...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chise Asukagawa：</span><br>
...I want to see the real Goldburn again...<br>
Sorry, look at me getting all sentimental over here! Let's get back to searching for the others!<br>

So laaaame. We're being left out of the fun.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Namiko：</span><br>
I want to head out and have some fun, too!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Purity：</span><br>
You said the same thing last time.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Namiko：</span><br>
That's right. Exactly why I'm extra pissed!<br>
Last time, we were left out because we weren't part of the combat force, but we have our riggings now!<br>
Don't you want to go and like, have some fun rampaging around?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hass：</span><br>
I want to test its performance...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hermione ：</span><br>
Fighting on the front lines may be nice, but supporting your allies from the back lines is just as important.<br>
Oh, would you like some refreshments? We have some tea and coffee... though I'm afraid that they're instant.<br>
Please enjoy, if you'd like.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Namiko：</span><br>
Woah, thank you!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hass：</span><br>
Thanks! Are you a maid, Miss Hermione? That's amazing... I've never seen a real maid before.<br>
What does a shipgirl who's a maid do? Cleaning's not all you do, right?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hermione ：</span><br>
At the port, I help out with the work at the office, help manage the fleet, and do special jobs for Her Highness and the Commander.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Namiko：</span><br>
Hold up, don't leave the juicy details out. What kind of "special jobs" are we talking about here?<br>
Tell us as much as you can~!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hermione ：</span><br>
Huh? There isn't anything particularly strange that I'm leaving out, though...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hass：</span><br>
So you're already so intimate that it's nothing particularly strange! Wow, wow~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kasumi：</span><br>
I'm... curious too...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Purity：</span><br>
I'd like to know what these special jobs are!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kasumi：</span><br>
You stay quiet, Purifier...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Purity：</span><br>
Why me! Everyone else is saying the same thing!<br>
I've even built scouts for us that will automatically alert us when a large foe is spotted!<br>
If there's any enemy movement, we'll be the first ones to know! This way, we won't have to waste time wandering around aimlessly!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kasumi：</span><br>
Purifier, you're talented... This school isn't disappearing, unlike the rest of the town...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Purity：</span><br>
I'm not really sure why that's the case either.<br>
But it's fine, isn't it? As long as we can make it out of here safely.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Siren：</span><br>
(Alarm blaring) .........!!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Purity：</span><br>
Look, something's coming! It's not a large kaiju this time, but some Sirens were spotted at the nearby sea!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kasumi：</span><br>
Let Spee know so she can tell everyone else...!<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Roon：</span><br>
Doesn't feel like there's any sentience coming from that formation over there. Must be a bunch of mass-produced tin cans.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Edinburgh：</span><br>
I don't think Mujina's taken notice of us either... Alright everyone, now's our chance!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akane Shinjo：</span><br>
So, we're gonna seize victory in a single fell swoop?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Rikka Takarada：</span><br>
Wait, let's slow down a sec. If we were sent here by the Sirens, shouldn't we at least try to talk things through?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Roon：</span><br>
And what if the other side doesn't feel like talking?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Rikka Takarada：</span><br>
Then we launch a surprise attack?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Roon：</span><br>
Then it wouldn't be a surprise attack. We might even get intercepted by those mass-produced ships.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Rikka Takarada：</span><br>
You're right... The most important thing is getting everyone back safely...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Edinburgh：</span><br>
Yup. That's why we've got to defeat these mass-produced ships right now.<br>
Try not to overextend, Roon! Let's make sure to clear out all the small fry first.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Roon：</span><br>
You don't need to tell me that. After all, you should always hamstring your prey before going in for the kill~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akane Shinjo：</span><br>

Woohoo! You're doing great, Alexis!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yume Minami：</span><br>
Mujina, we have you completely surrounded! Give it up already!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chise Asukagawa：</span><br>
I never thought this would be where we'd meet again... Wait, huh? Where's the giant kaiju that was with you?<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Mujina：</span><br>
Wait. I'm not here to fight you.<br>
That kaiju you just mentioned... I cannot control it. That's why I'm searching for it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
I see. At least it seems you're not sided with the Sirens...<br>
What were you doing around that kaiju then? Were you going to use that "domination" power of yours?<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Mujina：</span><br>
Yes, but even with this special rigging, I wasn't able to control it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chise Asukagawa：</span><br>
But if you were able to control it, what would you do? ...Would you use it to attack us?<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Mujina：</span><br>
I... haven't thought about that yet.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chise Asukagawa：</span><br>
I dunno if we can trust you... Souryuu-senpai, Hiryuu-senpai, we should be careful around her!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Souryuu：</span><br>
First, we need to determine whether you're with the Sirens. What did the Sirens offer you?<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Mujina：</span><br>
How did you know about that? ...Yes, the Sirens invited me to come to a world where I could control as many kaiju as my heart so desired.<br>
And then, they gave me this special rigging.<br>
But once I came here, even after I learned how to use the special rigging they made for me, I was still unable to control the kaiju here.<br>
And without the rigging, I would not even be able to detect the presence of any kaiju... It does seem that I've been made the fool.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yume Minami：</span><br>
A clear and concise explanation. It's just as you suspected, Mujina.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Souryuu：</span><br>
In other words, finding that kaiju seems to be the only key to leaving this place... That being the case, there's no reason for us to fight each other.<br>
The Sirens are our common enemy. How about it? Shall we forge an alliance for now?<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Mujina：</span><br>
How much do you know about those Sirens?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Roon：</span><br>
There's a lot I can tell you. After all, we've been fighting them for a long, loooong time.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Mujina：</span><br>
I see... Then let us work together.<br>

Are you sure we're going the right way...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mujina：</span><br>
Yeah. This is the place it always goes to hide.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Purity：</span><br>
That's the same reading that your favorite teacher here got!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Edinburgh：</span><br>
...That Siren ability to control mass-produced ships really comes in handy, huh...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mujina：</span><br>
That it does, but it doesn't seem to always work. There's much I still do not understand about this power.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Roon：</span><br>
Luckily enough, there's an entire buffet of Siren ships in front of us for you to test your powers on~<br>
We just have to get closer first to see exactly how many there are. This should be a great opportunity to vent a bit~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Communicator：</span><br>
(Alarm blaring) .........!!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kasumi：</span><br>
There's something massive approaching us... What is that...?<br>
<br>
From beyond the horizon, the sea was covered by a steel shadow.<br>
Not only was it as menacing as a dragon ready to strike, but various parts of its body were equipped with heavy artillery, endowing it with enough firepower to defeat any enemy while still maintaining a dignified appearance.<br>
There could be no doubt – this was the kaiju.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yume Minami：</span><br>
No way... it's even bigger than it was before?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Roon：</span><br>
Quite the formidable foe... but I wouldn't have it any other way~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Purity：</span><br>
Wait, hold on! We need to get out of here! We can't fight that thing!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Roon：</span><br>
Oh my, is the mighty Purifier going to run with her tail tucked between her legs?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Purity：</span><br>
Fear has nothing to do with it! That thing... isn't normal!<br>
We can't defeat it! As a matter of fact, we'll be totally crushed! We need to get out of here!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Roon：</span><br>
...You say that, but that thing's already headed straight towards us. Since we have the numbers advantage, why don't we send some planes at it to see how tough it really is?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hiryuu：</span><br>
I like the sound of that. Souryuu, let's get ready to send our planes out to get a feel for how this thing fights!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chise Asukagawa：</span><br>
Senpaiiii!! I can help too!<br>
<br>
KABOOM––!!<br>
The shipgirls deployed their aircraft to engage the massive kaiju.<br>
...However, neither gun nor bomb could leave even a scratch on the kaiju's body.<br>
The attacks seemed to bounce harmlessly of its body, as if protected by some kind of invisible shield.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chise Asukagawa：</span><br>
Whaaaat? It didn't work?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mujina：</span><br>
It's different from before. It seems to have gained some kind of defensive mechanism.<br>
It's not just bigger. It's also gotten stronger.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Rikka Takarada：</span><br>
I don't like the way it's looking at us... Uhh, isn't this pretty bad?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Roon：</span><br>
Ugh! I'll admit, that thing DOES pack a punch!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Purity：</span><br>
Didn't I already tell you before? Let's hurry up and get out of here, dunces!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Roon：</span><br>
I'm not done yet! Raaaaargh!!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Roon! Get back here...!<br>
She's not listening! Crap, we're getting separated by the kaiju's attacks...!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Edinburgh：</span><br>
What would the Commander do in this situation? Ugh, but the flagship should be the one to make that call...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yume Minami：</span><br>
Is that really important right now?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Edinburgh：</span><br>
Y-you're right... but Roon's really scary, and the Commander isn't here... What would Bel do if she was here..?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ryuujou：</span><br>
Don't worry about her, Edinburgh! Just do what you think is right!<br>
<br>
The massive enemy began charging its massive beam, and the party could only gulp as they prepared to face the incoming crisis.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yume Minami：</span><br>
I'll take care of things over here, so make sure you go and get the other shipgirls!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Roon：</span><br>
Tsk... Those defenses are really keeping me from having my fun...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Edinburgh：</span><br>
That's enough! Roon, everyone, regroup and retreat at once!<br>

Despite the kaiju's withering firepower, the party was able to retreat back to the school without any injuries.<br>
The plan was to retreat further up into the mountains to buy more time, but the kaiju appeared to stop pursuing them.<br>
While the Siren fleet re-established their blockade in the waters, they also did not take any further actions.<br>
School - Classroom<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akane Shinjo：</span><br>
That kaiju must be the key to leaving the Mirror Sea. The enemy knows this as well, which is why they're set up around it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Souryuu：</span><br>
Sharp observation. As such, it's impossible for us to attack them head-on.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
So what's the plan? Think we can brute force our way through with sheer numbers? We haven't been able to reestablish contact with the Port though...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mujina：</span><br>
I can try to procure some more mass-produced Siren ships.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chise Asukagawa：</span><br>
That sounds like a good idea! Not only will we be able to get stronger, we'll also be draining the enemy's forces!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Purity：</span><br>
Rejected! That takes way too long! I've got a better idea!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Edinburgh：</span><br>
Purity? You've been acting kind of strange...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Really? Hasn't Purifier always been like this?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Purity：</span><br>
Huh? Have I always been such a genius?! Lightbulbs are going off in my head like crazy!<br>
Yeah, I'm pretty awesome, aren't I...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Roon：</span><br>
Let's stay on topic.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Purity：</span><br>
Okay, okay. So during that last battle, I couldn't help but notice that the kaiju kept looking at me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Huh? Was it?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kasumi：</span><br>
Kasumi... noticed that too...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Souryuu：</span><br>
I suppose that's plausible. Was that the reason you were in a rush to get everyone to retreat?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Purity：</span><br>
Uh, yeah! The moment I made eye contact with it, I immediately "understood" its structure.<br>
...I don't have any specific details, but all kinds of blueprints and weapon designs flashed through my head.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yume Minami：</span><br>
Like looking at a status screen?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Edinburgh：</span><br>
A what...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Purity：</span><br>
Yeah, yeah! Just like that! And I could tell that our level gap was too great, or something like that.<br>
I also could see that it considered me the greatest threat out of all of you!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Edinburgh：</span><br>
So, it was trying to take you out first?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Souryuu：</span><br>
Who would its second priority be then? Mujina?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Purity：</span><br>
Yeah, you get it! Did you see it too?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Souryuu：</span><br>
No, but I have a pretty good idea of how the Sirens operate. After all, that kaiju was created by the Sirens.<br>
It would be safe to assume that Purifier, who is a Siren herself, and Mujina, who has the ability to control Sirens, are seen as prime targets.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akane Shinjo：</span><br>
That makes sense... They're more worried about getting sabotaged from the inside than about an external attack.<br>
I guess I'd be third on that list then? Hehe~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Purity：</span><br>
Dunno who comes after that, but it does feel pretty scary having a huge monster like that coming after you.<br>
I just wanted to be an ordinary schoolteacher~ I never expected something like this to happen to me~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Edinburgh：</span><br>
...You're an elite Siren yourself!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Purity：</span><br>
Am I? If I really was this "Purifier," there's no way I wouldn't be able to handle an enemy like that, right?<br>
I can't even fight. All I can do is use the school's facilities to help others resupply, and make riggings. Does that sound like a high-ranking elite to you?<br>
In other words... This is just my conjecture, but this Mirror Sea is currently sealing away my true powers.<br>
If I was to regain my powers, maybe I'd be able to defeat that huge kaiju?<br>
Besides, if everyone's beloved Miss Purity was able to regain control of this Mirror Sea... Maybe I'd even do you a favor and send you back home~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hiryuu：</span><br>
Working with her is too risky...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
But we don't really have a choice. We can't break through the enemy lines ourselves.<br>
If we really could help Purifier regain her powers, that'd be the best shot we have.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Purity：</span><br>
Absolutely! That's an honor student for you!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Roon：</span><br>
Nonsense. The first thing you'd do when you regain your powers would be to attack us.<br>
Even if we managed to defeat that kaiju, we'd stand no chance against you after you regain control of the entire Mirror Sea.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Purity：</span><br>
What are you talking about? That kaiju was clearly trying to take us all out! What happened to our united alliance?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Roon：</span><br>
We'll need something to hold you to your word.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hermione ：</span><br>
Hass, Namiko, Kasumi, and I will make sure she doesn't try anything funny.<br>
We'll let everyone know right away if she makes any suspicious moves.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Roon：</span><br>
Sounds like a plan then... I'm glad the Royal Maids are a reliable bunch.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Purity：</span><br>
Now that you have your plan, let's get started! I'll tell you where this Mirror Sea's control device is, so let's begin our recapture strategy from there!<br>

Even though I'm a Royal Maid myself... I almost never get complimented like that...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yume Minami：</span><br>
I heard you have a little sister who's made quite the name for herself... Belfast, was it?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Edinburgh：</span><br>
She's the Head Maid. There's nothing she can't do, and she's earned everyone's trust and praise.<br>
Then... there's me. *Sigh*...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yume Minami：</span><br>
It must be really hard living in her shadow... I mean, I can imagine people always comparing the two of you...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Edinburgh：</span><br>
Yeah, totally! I want others to see me for who I am as well...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yume Minami：</span><br>
Well, your sister isn't here this time, so now's your chance, right?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Edinburgh：</span><br>
That's also what I thought at first, but... this whole thing has gone bottoms up.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yume Minami：</span><br>
If you ask me, I think you've already proven yourself. Earlier, when you made the call to retreat, that was a good showing.<br>
Because Purity interjected earlier, we never decided who would be flagship. I think it's your time to shine.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Edinburgh：</span><br>
Me...? I'm not sure I...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yume Minami：</span><br>
I'm sure you'll be fine. After all, a remarkable little sister... must've looked up to a remarkable big sister! It all starts with believing in yourself!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Edinburgh：</span><br>
.........You're right. Edinburgh's not gonna get done in by whatever that thing is!<br>
Thanks for the advice, Yume. I'll go talk to the others!<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Rikka Takarada：</span><br>
...By the way, Akane... If we follow the plan, we're going to have to go recapture the other control devices.<br>

Oh well~ Let's go, Alexis! You'll get to rampage to your heart's content when we fight the boss!<br>
Don't get yourself killed before we get all the control devices back, Purity!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Giant Purity：</span><br>
As if! Even right now, I'm more than capable of going toe-to-toe with that fella...<br>

I didn't expect this plan to work so smoothly...<br>
Color me surprised, Edinburgh. You certainly rose to the occasion, and then exceeded it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Edinburgh：</span><br>
Ehehe, I'm flattered... All right then, let's finish mopping up these mass-produced ships!<br>
Then... we'll help Purity defeat that giant kaiju!<br>

<br>
The battle rages on––<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Edinburgh：</span><br>
Keep laying down the fire support! Don't stop shooting!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Roon：</span><br>
Even with all the control devices, we still aren't able to take down that kaiju...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
The mass-produced Sirens are converging on this location as well... Looks like they're serious about this showdown as well.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mujina：</span><br>
I'll handle them. My rigging is perfect for dealing with enemies that try to swarm us with sheer numbers.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akane Shinjo：</span><br>
Hehe. I'll come with you then. I want to take a better look at this splendid scenery from a distance~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hass：</span><br>
I bet that'd make for a terrific photo op! Let me come with you too!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Namiko：</span><br>
If Hass is going, then count me in as well~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Rikka Takarada：</span><br>
I'll pass. Someone's got to stay behind and keep up the fire support.<br>
...Also am I going crazy, or does nobody here have any sense of urgency?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akane Shinjo：</span><br>
What a killjoy~<br>
I guess it's because Purity is doing most of the hard work, not us.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Giant Purity：</span><br>
I heard that, you know!! Hurry up and give me more backup––!!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akane Shinjo：</span><br>
Alright, you heard her. Let's go take out that Siren trash!<br>

█▇▆▅▄▃▂▁█▇▆▅▄▃▂▁█▇▆▅▄▃▂▁█▇▆▅▄▃▂▁<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ryuujou：</span><br>
Woah...! What the heck was that attack?!<br>
It feels like the entire world is vibrating, water and air alike...!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hiryuu：</span><br>
We've encountered other Mirror Seas like this before! I think it's a special combination attack that's also causing anomalous weather, Souryuu!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Souryuu：</span><br>
Indeed. My electronic devices have been completely disabled...!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Edinburgh：</span><br>
Purifier! Are you okay? Do you need to retreat first?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Giant Purity：</span><br>
Huh? Retreat? I barely even felt that!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Edinburgh：</span><br>
Did your rigging not get affected by that electromagnetic attack?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Giant Purity：</span><br>
Don't think so? I might be immune to stuff like that!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Edinburgh：</span><br>
Wow... If the kaiju's attack didn't work on Purity, then–<br>
Purity, listen to me! Pretend you've been disabled by that attack!<br>
Lure the kaiju into thinking it can finish you off, then blow it to pieces when it's lowered its guard!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Giant Purity：</span><br>
Huh? Oh, I see! ...Blargh! Curses! I'm done foooooor––!<br>
<br>
Due to Purity's strange behavior, the rampaging kaiju finally paused its attack.<br>
Shipgirls and Sirens were littered around the water, rendered motionless by the prior attack. The massive Purity seemed weakened and vulnerable as well.<br>
As if satisfied by the apparent incapacitation of the elite Siren, the kaiju momentarily took its aim off from Purity.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chise Asukagawa：</span><br>
Now's your chance, Purity! Hit it hard!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Giant Purity：</span><br>
Hell yeah! You've activated my trap card! Take this!!!!<br>
Look at me – it's the last thing you'll ever see, loser......!<br>
Huh? What's wrong with me today? Surely I could've come up with a better insult than that...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Edinburgh：</span><br>
NOW'S NOT THE TIME FOR THAT!! HURRY UP AND SHOOT!!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yume Minami：</span><br>
Pull out a Something Beam, anything! Hurry up, or that kaiju's going to get you!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Giant Purity：</span><br>
Let a girl enjoy her two seconds in the spotlight, jeez! Target, locked on! Whatchamacallit Something Beam... FIIIIIIIIIIIRE!!<br>

<br>
Town - Waters near East Sector, after the battle<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ryuujou：</span><br>
The kaiju... The kaiju's gone!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kasumi：</span><br>
It turned into light...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Edinburgh：</span><br>
That's because it wasn't a real kaiju, just a replica made by the Sirens...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chise Asukagawa：</span><br>
So, now that we've defeated the kaiju and regained control of the Mirror Sea... does that mean we can go home?<br>
I thought some kind of door or portal would open up after we defeated the kaiju... Is it not going to be that simple?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Rikka Takarada：</span><br>
*sigh*... Even after all that fighting, we're still going to have to find a way back home...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hass：</span><br>
The road back is littered with hardship––<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Namiko：</span><br>
Are you breaking out into poetry now?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Rikka Takarada：</span><br>
Is that something we learned in class...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hass：</span><br>
Nah, it's something I saw on my socials the other day. I thought it sounded really deep, so I wanted to try using it.<br>
Wasn't it pretty relatable just now...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Namiko：</span><br>
What do you think, Miss Purity?<br>
Wait, she's gone?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Rikka Takarada：</span><br>
Wait... where did she go?! How'd such a huge thing disappear into thin air?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yume Minami：</span><br>
That's not the only thing that's disappearing. The school, the town, all of it is...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mujina：</span><br>
What's going on now?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Souryuu：</span><br>
When we defeated the kaiju, Purifier must've regained full control of this Mirror Sea. And now, as her name implies... She's purifying it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Namiko：</span><br>
No way... Does this mean I'm not even going to get a chance to say goodbye to her?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hass：</span><br>
I wonder if Purity's okay...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Edinburgh：</span><br>
She's a high-ranking elite Siren, after all. I doubt anything bad happened to her. Probably.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akane Shinjo：</span><br>
In the end, we never managed to find out if Purifier and Purity are actually one and the same...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Edinburgh：</span><br>
Fair point. But I don't think that's anything you need to worry about.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Souryuu：</span><br>
I think it's for the best. If we had to bring her back to the Port, I can't imagine how the Commander would react...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Maybe her disappearing along with the Mirror Sea really is the best outcome we can hope for...<br>
As for our friends from another world, don't you fret. I'm sure we'll be able to figure out a solution once we get back to the Port.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hiryuu：</span><br>
I'm sure Akashi... is used to dealing with things like this by now.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yume Minami：</span><br>
This Port you're talking about is where all your friends are, right? I'd hate to impose...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ryuujou：</span><br>
We're not the type to turn our backs on people in need! I'll go inform the Commander myself!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Edinburgh：</span><br>
Let's head back to the Port then, everyone! Set sail!<br>
Ehehe, it's almost as if I'm the flagship~♪<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Roon：</span><br>
I can understand your enthusiasm, but do you even know how to get back from where we are now?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Edinburgh：</span><br>
Uhh, well, let me check that real quick!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Ahaha... That's just like you, Edinburgh.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Edinburgh：</span><br>
J-just give me a minute over here! We'll be back home in no time, where Belfast and the Commander will be waiting for us!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Everyone：</span><br>
Hahaha~!<br>
<br>
Under a clear blue sky, upon the tranquil blue sea, a journey full of twists and turns draws to an end.<br>
"This is Admiral Graf Spee. I've managed to make contact with the others. They appear to all be safe."<br>
"Yes, Belfast. I'll now escort them back to the Port."<br>
"They're accompanied by visitors from another world. They all appear to be good people."<br>
"Yes, please contact Akashi and the Commander."<br>
"Hmm? What about Edinburgh?"<br>
"She's al– Mm, actually, I think you should ask her yourself once she gets back."<br>
"...you won't believe what I just did, Bel––"<br>
