Happiness Is Incalculable<br>
<br>
1 Imperfect Data<br>
We've finished more than half of our work for the day, and it's time to take a break, yet Fargo remains immersed in her pile of documents.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fargo：</span><br>
...Based on my calculations, the customer's return on investment seems to be within a reasonable range.<br>
However, based on the actual feedback we got, customer dissatisfaction is far exceeding estimates.<br>
What's known for sure is that the customers are angry.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
What are you researching, Fargo?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fargo：</span><br>
Oh. Commander. According to my analysis, your confusion index sits at 72.70%.<br>
Sorry, am I disrupting your break?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Not really. I'm just wondering what's got you looking so serious.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fargo：</span><br>
Serious? Hm... That value does sit at 81.48%. I suppose I should raise my relaxation index.<br>
I wasn't trying to look serious on purpose, but the situation might indeed be pretty serious.<br>
The reason is – I started a new business of express-delivering mystery boxes.<br>
I'd noticed that people were drawn more to products with an element of randomness, as opposed to plain ones.<br>
For the sake of both customer experience and profitability, I also carefully calculated the probabilities for the contents.<br>
This perfectly balanced scheme should have brought in lots of customers and profit, but in reality, the rate of negative reviews is as high as 36.49%.<br>
I've even received comments such as, "I rated this one star because it didn't relieve the pain of not getting something worth even one star."<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：I think they were just venting their anger.</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：I think I get how they feel...</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fargo：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Whatever the case, it's negatively affecting my review score.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''True that. We've gotta figure out some sort of solution. Do you know the reason why this happened?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fargo：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''You do? You share their sentiment?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Well, not to the same extent. Anyway, do you know the reason why this happened?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fargo：</span><br>
I initially suspected my calculations were erroneous, but I get the same results every time I redo them.<br>
Furthermore, the product listing shows all the mystery box probabilities. If something were wrong with it, customers would no doubt raise complaints about it.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
So the probabilities aren't the issue?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fargo：</span><br>
Most likely not, but I can't think of any other explanation at the moment.<br>
Hmm... Commander, what do you say we go and do some field research?<br>
If it's not too much to ask for, I'd like you to open some boxes and experience it for yourself.<br>
All the boxes contain regular products you can find on store shelves.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Basically, you wanna get my opinion?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fargo：</span><br>
Yes. A single box is too small a sample size, however, so let's start with 100.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
One... hundred?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fargo：</span><br>
Don't worry. I won't charge you for any of them.<br>
The value of your feedback far exceeds the cost of the products, anyway.<br>

<br>
Happiness Is Incalculable<br>
<br>
2 Module Disabling Protocol<br>
I open yet another mystery box, adding to the mountain of loot piling up in my office.<br>
The pile is made up of many ordinary products you can find anywhere, with duplicates apparent even at a glance.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fargo：</span><br>
Hmm. You had bad luck, but still within acceptable limits.<br>
Your current emotions seem to be... 60.92% calm, 8.65% disappointment, with other, complicated feelings mixed in as well.<br>
While these emotions are within my estimates, they seem very detached from the context they're in.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
It's 'cause they were all free. I didn't get anything good, but I didn't spend any money either, so I can deal with it.<br>
On the other hand, there's no way those who DID spend money would be content with such an average result.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fargo：</span><br>
I see... Thank you for the valuable feedback.<br>
The fact that so many unforeseen problems have occurred is an indication that I need to update my emotional analysis module.<br>
With new emotional observation data, I'll be able to draw more accurate conclusions.<br>
Incidentally, I have an idea...<br>
An idea on how to collect more authentic data in a more direct manner.<br>
Would you mind it if I spent the rest of the day with you without relying on my emotional indexes?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
You mean you're gonna turn off your analyzer?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fargo：</span><br>
Yes. It may not immediately resolve the issue at hand, but it would give me a hands-on understanding of the sheer depth of emotions.<br>
In truth, I feel a bit uncomfortable about doing this. Well, perhaps this feeling is less "discomfort" and more "shyness."<br>
To me, interacting with people without access to emotion indexes leaves me feeling vulnerable – as if I were completely naked.<br>
I will likely become rather awkward and struggle to grasp many emotions...<br>
That's why I would only dare to test something like this with you.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Ah. I get what you're saying.<br>
You're basically suggesting we go on a little outing, right?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fargo：</span><br>
According to my data, such an act is commonly referred to as a "date."<br>
With that in mind...<br>
Commander... could we go on a date?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Sure. Let's head out right now.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fargo：</span><br>
Great! Thank you, Commander.<br>
Before I turn my module off, let me express one last feeling to you.<br>
In this moment, my happiness index is skyrocketing.<br>

Happiness Is Incalculable<br>
<br>
3 Going by Instinct<br>
Fargo and I walked along the stone-paved path, taking in the romantic vibe unique to a date.<br>
She explained that there was a need to simulate all kinds of different date scenarios while we were doing this test.<br>
She's going to try to accurately read my emotions, and if she manages to grasp the unspoken meaning behind them, she passes.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Let's see how this goes...)<br>
I'm a bit tired after all this walking. Why don't we take a break at the café over there?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fargo：</span><br>
Oh. You're tired already?<br>
In that case, I suggest resting on the bench right here. It's closer, and it doesn't cost us anything.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I mean... It's not JUST about being tired.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fargo：</span><br>
Is it because you... wish to rest in the shade? Or because you're thirsty?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Not a bad analysis, but those aren't the only things a café can provide.<br>
We're on a date, remember? A date can't be solely about what's functional and efficient while costing the least.<br>
Sitting in a store with a person you like, listening to music, and having a chat – that's pleasant, and that matters.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fargo：</span><br>
In other words, you don't merely want to sit down or drink something...<br>
You also want to enjoy some time with me – is that correct?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
That's basically the main thing I want to do, yeah.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fargo：</span><br>
Hmm... Now that I know the answer and work backwards from it, I can certainly see the logic.<br>
Why, then, didn't I grasp that from the very start?<br>
Okay, let's go and experience some other date scenarios.<br>
How about starting with the idea you had? Of going to that café.<br>
I'm ready, Commander. Please pick a topic.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
We just got our desserts and drinks, so I say we enjoy those while we chat.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fargo：</span><br>
A good idea. Let's do that.<br>
Mmh. This one is incredibly delicious.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Yeah, mine's also really tasty. There's not a lot of it, but the taste is phenomenal.<br>
Wanna try a bite? I set the strawberries aside just for you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fargo：</span><br>
......<br>
Given the situation, I should...<br>
I've got it! Instead of me eating all your precious strawberries, I should order more desserts instead.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Huh? Why would you do that?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fargo：</span><br>
You said earlier that there's no need to save money or worry about being efficient while on a date.<br>
Since our desserts are delicious, we should order more so we can both have as much as we want.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Ohh. That's how you interpreted it...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fargo：</span><br>
Touring an aquarium after having afternoon tea – this is a great date plan.<br>
Commander, what kind of topics tend to come up at times like this?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
With a mood as nice as this, they drift more toward the sentimental side of things.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fargo：</span><br>
That sounds tricky.<br>
Even so, I'll try my best.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Right. Let me give you an example.<br>
When you see those fish swimming around without a care in the world, doesn't it make you wish you were them?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fargo：</span><br>
Wish I was them... Hmm...<br>
<br>
After a moment of thinking, Fargo suddenly starts undressing. A strip of thin fabric hits the floor.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fargo：</span><br>
...Why are you stopping me, Commander? Your expression looks odd.<br>
Is that... a look of shock? Why are you shocked?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I should be the one asking "why" here. Why'd you suddenly start taking your clothes off?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fargo：</span><br>
You asked if seeing those fish swimming without a care in the world made me wish I was one of them...<br>
Did that not mean you wanted to go swimming?<br>

Happiness Is Incalculable<br>
<br>
4　50.00% Happiness<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
For our next spot, how about the amusement park?<br>
There are tons of attractions, and it's a classic date spot, so there should be plenty of chances for us to do your tests.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fargo：</span><br>
Yes. It might even be the perfect place.<br>
I just want to say...<br>
Thank you, Commander, for sticking with me this far.<br>
I thought about it a bit, and I think it might be best if we stop these tests for now.<br>
My inaccuracy rate is just too high. Even if I do make a correct guess, it could just be blind luck.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Don't put yourself down. It's normal to fail the first time you try anything. Just keep at it, slow and steady.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fargo：</span><br>
Okay. I feel like I've learned something, at least – that there's no strong correlation between numbers and emotions.<br>
Also, I calculated the probability of this test being a success before we left.<br>
I determined that there was an 87.06% chance of encountering many things I could not grasp without relying on my emotion indexes.<br>
I knew what I was getting into, in other words.<br>
But, even though I knew the numbers, I still felt genuinely and inevitably frustrated. Just like my mystery box customers.<br>
It's clear to me that I can't keep taking up your time like this.<br>
Even after all the tests you've helped me with, my correct answer rate has only gotten close to a mere 50.00%.<br>
To put it another way, I lack the ability to reach the correct answers right now. My reliance on instinct only leads me to make blind guesses.<br>
Of course, I did feel many positive emotions during our date. I'm genuinely grateful for that.<br>
It's just... I need to reconsider what direction to take my business in.<br>
The express delivery industry is a subset of the service industry, and yet, I'm unable to grasp people's needs and feelings...<br>
Chasing efficiency alone and fixating on numbers will not lead me to success in any true sense.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：You WILL succeed one day if you hold on to that mindset.</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：I really enjoyed the time we spent together.</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fargo：</span><br>
Thank you, Commander. And sorry for taking up so much of your precious time...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
There's potential inside of you. You should believe in yourself and give it another try.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fargo：</span><br>
......<br>
I'm not that confident in my intuition, but if you trust me that much, then...<br>
I'll keep at it a little longer.<br>
I hope to end this date on the best note possible.<br>

<br>
Happiness Is Incalculable<br>
<br>
5 Roller Coaster of Logic<br>
Business matters aside, I don't think there's a singular right answer for how to act on a date.<br>
What is clear is that Fargo's judgments, made without relying on her emotion indexes, truly came from the heart.<br>
I want to see her true self, no matter how inexperienced, awkward, or eccentric it is.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fargo：</span><br>
Now that we're here, what attraction should we go on?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
This is the perfect time for a test. I'll let you decide.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fargo：</span><br>
Well, if I got to choose...<br>
I'd go with the haunted house.<br>
All this time, I've never understood why people like haunted houses.<br>
There is no sense of speed or fantastic view to enjoy, unlike a roller coaster. It only induces fear.<br>
Is fear not a bad emotion? Why would someone choose to be scared?<br>
Conversely, if you don't get scared, there's no reason to want to experience a haunted house, either.<br>
I believe that people enter haunted houses because they want to test their own limits.<br>
I want to see where my limits lie, too.<br>
So, let's go and take the scariest route they recommend to us.<br>
Hmm... I see a pitch-dark corridor. That's unsettling.<br>
Let's go there. Maybe it will make us feel afraid.<br>
A coffin covered in seals. I wonder what would happen if you removed them.<br>
Are you scared, Commander? Stay close to me if you are.<br>
I feel like my heart is beating faster... Maybe it's the suspension bridge effect in action?<br>
Feel my chest, Commander. I can't quite explain this feeling, so... I want you to sense it for yourself.<br>
Oh. It's already over? That felt like no time at all.<br>
How do you think I did, Commander?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Good takes. That's very you.</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：Yeah. It was over before I knew it.</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fargo：</span><br>
Are you saying... I did well?<br>
In that case, we should check out another attraction while we have the time.<br>
<br>
Just like that, we take our seats, strap in, and wait to be carried off to above the clouds.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
So... we're going for the roller coaster.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fargo：</span><br>
Yes. I realized something new after experiencing the haunted house.<br>
I think the haunted house offers another thing, beyond testing yourself – the fun of observing the reactions of the person you bring along.<br>
Roller coasters have a similar quality, and that's why I'm now going to closely watch you.<br>
<br>
Before I can respond, the roller coaster slowly comes to life, and starts building speed on the rails.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fargo：</span><br>
There are two things I want to observe: your reactions, and your emotions.<br>
This is not only part of the fun of this thrilling attraction, but also the goal of this date.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Fair enough. That makes sense.<br>
<br>
I say that, but it wouldn't make sense for many others.<br>
We arrive at the top, and as the roller coaster prepares to go downhill, her eyes remain fixated on me as she pays no attention to the view.<br>
In this calm instant, she seems to set her mind to something.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fargo：</span><br>
Commander...<br>
I want to more directly feel what you're feeling now.<br>
<br>
Before she's done speaking, she gently grasps my hand. The very next moment, the roller coaster begins its descent at incredible speed.<br>
The weightlessness kicks in, and the wind blows past both our sides as it feels like I'm flying. Yet, neither of us screams as we normally would have.<br>
Instead, we just stare at each other in silence. The surroundings turn into a blur while our hearts race with excitement.<br>

<br>
6 Return-to-Zero Operation<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fargo：</span><br>
The sun is starting to set. This looks like it'll be our last attraction on this date.<br>
<br>
A gondola leading to the sky comes to a stop in front of us. Before it starts to move away, Fargo takes my hand and leads me inside.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Wrapping up a date on a Ferris wheel. Imagine that.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fargo：</span><br>
After all the things I've experienced with you today, I suppose what I'm feeling now would be called... "happiness."<br>
If I were to analyze this feeling, what value do you think the emotion index would show?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：I bet it'd be 100%.</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：It might overflow and exceed the display range.</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fargo：</span><br>
Oh. Did you genuinely calculate that, or is that just hyperbole?<br>
Well, whatever the case, you're making this happy feeling all the stronger.<br>
<br>
She holds her hand up against the window, and gazes at the splendid night view of the amusement park.<br>
There's an intense focus in her eyes, like she's looking through crystal at a fantastical world that you'd only find in a story.<br>
Today has been a fun, wild ride. Like we were speeding far, far away, leaving all our troubles behind in the wind.<br>
Now, the ground view grows ever distant beneath us, the Ferris wheel turning slowly yet steadily like a clock hand moving up toward midnight.<br>
That is the climax of our trip, and also the start of our home journey. When the Ferris wheel begins to descend again, that will signal the approaching end of our date.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fargo：</span><br>
...Commander?<br>
What is it? Your expression doesn't feel like it matches the mood.<br>
Shouldn't you be excited to be aboard a Ferris wheel with someone you like?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I am. I'm having a great time.<br>
<br>
"There's just something on my mind. I'm not sure if all we experienced today, and all the memories we made, will be able to solve your issue." I just cannot muster the will to say those words.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fargo：</span><br>
...Commander.<br>
This has been a fun and wonderful day.<br>
Thank you so much – for coming with me on this absurd date, and for trying so hard to fix my problem.<br>
When I proposed this date, I couldn't fully estimate just how much trouble I'd be causing you.<br>
And I certainly couldn't have predicted one other thing...<br>
That you'd go along with the bad choices I made and stick around for me.<br>
Now I know why, though. It's because you cared about me.<br>
Truthfully, I've been aware for a while that you're being patient with me. I was deceptive and pretended not to notice, but it made me really glad.<br>
<br>
She looks at me, and unknowingly grips my hand firmly. It seems she's unsure what to do with the feelings inside of her.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
If anyone's been deceptive here, it's me. If you don't mind, could you tell me how you figured that out?<br>
If it was through intuition, then that's proof of how much you've improved.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fargo：</span><br>
No. It wasn't that. My intuition has almost never been right.<br>
Really, I just did what I've always done...<br>
I figured it out by analyzing the statistics.<br>

Happiness Is Incalculable<br>
<br>
7 Midnight Magic<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
...By analyzing the statistics?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fargo：</span><br>
Yes. Even with my emotional analysis module turned off, I still habitually record all sorts of data to deduce patterns in all things.<br>
I made decisions in the amusement park that clearly went against common sense...<br>
And instead of correcting me, you positively cooperated and even gave me feedback.<br>
My correct response rate in these unique circumstances was much higher than it should be...<br>
So, I analyzed these circumstances and deduced your thinking from there.<br>
Resorting to reasoning and numbers without even thinking about it... I'm silly, aren't I?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Reasoning and numbers... You know, that's something only you can do.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fargo：</span><br>
Only... I can do?<br>
<br>
She cocks her head in confusion, and seems to ponder something.<br>
As night wears on, the amusement park's fireworks show reaches its most brilliant moment.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fargo：</span><br>
I... The time we spent together today made me really happy.<br>
This happiness seems to have resolved my worries over my mystery box business.<br>
All the positive things you made me feel have taught me a kind of lesson.<br>
That, although data is objective, people's decisions are sometimes guided by subjective expectations.<br>
Actual data-based probabilities don't matter to them as much as their own intuition, which gives rise to feelings of expectations that steer them.<br>
And now, looking back at the low ratings of my mystery boxes, I see what the problem was.<br>
They weren't upset about losing money. They were upset because their expectations weren't met.<br>
What most customers want is to get items beyond their expectations. Everyone hopes that they'll be among the lucky ones.<br>
Then, when they're let down, their mood swings just like mine did today...<br>
Regardless of my actual success rate, I felt down when the date wasn't going as I hoped.<br>
Of course, the consideration you showed me far exceeded my expectations, and that made me happy.<br>
So, Commander, you shouldn't really feel guilty for being nice to me.<br>
It's thanks to your kind patience that I've finally seen the logic between the lines...<br>
And it turned this experimental pretend-date into a real date.<br>
I'm not sure how I can describe what I'm feeling right now.<br>
I suppose that, when my happiness index exceeds 100.00%, then I should name that feeling "bliss."<br>
<br>
Before we know it, the clock hand strikes midnight, and the gondola reaches its peak.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fargo：</span><br>
Well... Let's do this like we said we would.<br>
Let's end this date on the best note possible.<br>
<br>
As the gondola gently rocks, she gracefully rises to her feet and comes up to me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fargo：</span><br>
By my judgment... a kiss as the curtains fall will mark the start of a new story.<br>
<br>
Her delicate fingers touch my shoulders, and her hair hangs in front of me.<br>
Another firework blossoms in a place as close to the sky as it can get. Its radiance in the night is breathtakingly beautiful.<br>
We both close our eyes at the same time – maybe because the light is too bright, or maybe because we want to remember its fleeting colors.<br>
Then, the union of her soft lips with mine brings a definite end to this night.<br>
