<br>
1 The Visitor Amidst Clouds<br>
Somewhere in the Sakura Islands...<br>
A girl with a fox mask on her head was painstakingly pushing a wheelbarrow up a mountain path.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yamashiro：</span><br>
Phew... Still a long way to go, huh...<br>
At least the road is well-maintained and not too hard to walk on...<br>
I wonder what people think about this famous tourist spot being closed for so long. Doesn't it raise more eyebrows than if we had just kept it open?<br>
I can understand barring uninvolved people from entering, but why do all the people involved have to stay quiet as well?<br>
And why do I have to use a wheelbarrow? I'm sure the gods of the forest would forgive me if I drove up...<br>
I'm at my wit's end here! This stuff's ridiculously heavy to lug around in a cart!<br>
What's next, are they going to ask me to bring up the disassembled naval gun components by cart too?<br>
...Ooh, I really shouldn't jinx myself like that. It probably isn't even out of the realm of possibility, haha...<br>
*sigh*... I'll just do as Akagi said and leave the nonessential supplies by the base of the mountain so they can be picked up later.<br>
Everything else is coming with me up this long trail...<br>
It was raining here not too long ago, but as long as I watch my step and make sure not to slip–––<br>
...Hwaah! Darn me and my big, fat mouth!<br>
<br>
As someone well-versed in tripping over her own feet, the girl quickly regained her balance and stabilized her wheelbarrow before it could tip over.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yamashiro：</span><br>
Holy moly, that was a close one... I would've been in so much trouble if I broke the stuff inside...<br>
...Focus, Yamashiro, focus! You've got to arrive before sunset!<br>
<br>
As the mountain road leveled out, the girl came upon a dignified, old-fashioned wooden building.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yamashiro：</span><br>
Here we are... Hellooo? Is anybody hooome?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Minazuki：</span><br>
Shiranui, we've got a visitor!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shiranui：</span><br>
If it isn't Yamashiro. I bid you welcome.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yamashiro：</span><br>
Oh hi! It's nice to see the two of you!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shiranui：</span><br>
We don't often get visitors around these parts.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yamashiro：</span><br>
That's not surprising. You're the ones who closed off the road, right?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shiranui：</span><br>
I'm afraid you're mistaken. We're only following orders, same as you.<br>
On another note, what's in that wheelbarrow you brought?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yamashiro：</span><br>
A present from Akagi, I suppose?<br>
She told me to leave the nonessential supplies at the mountain's base and bring the important stuff straight to you.<br>
What should I do with it? Leave it over here?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shiranui：</span><br>
Yes, over there will be just fine.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Minazuki：</span><br>
Thanks, Yamashiro. Could you send Akagi a message for us?<br>
Just tell her we got everything.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yamashiro：</span><br>
Will do! I'll let her know as soon as I can!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shiranui：</span><br>
Much obliged. It must've been a painstaking journey getting here.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yamashiro：</span><br>
It's fiiine, I'm used to it! Now, I'd better be on my way. I've got other business to deal with!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shiranui：</span><br>
Of course. Do mind your footing on the way back, as it rained earlier today.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yamashiro：</span><br>
Yeah, hahaha... I noticed that.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Minazuki：</span><br>
Bye-bye, Yamashiro! Stay safe!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yamashiro：</span><br>
Will do! See you!<br>

2 Clear Skies, Cresting Waves<br>
Sakura Islands islet - Mikasa's residence<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
How quaint. The weather is fine today, but the waves are turbulent.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kongou：</span><br>
I noticed the same thing as well. Quite a curious backdrop to the first teatime we've had in a while, Mikasa.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
Teatime, huh... How long has it been since we sat down together for something like this?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kongou：</span><br>
Indeed. It reminds me of my time at the Royal Islands.<br>
If I remember correctly, you went on a delegation there as the Combined Fleet flagship, right?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
I did... That was a long, long time ago.<br>
Back then, everyone in Europa was so gung-ho to launch a major counterattack against the Sirens.<br>
Comparing the Crimson Axis now to the unity we all shared back then is...<br>
Bah, let's change topics. What do you think about the Sardegnian expo that Shinano is attending?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kongou：</span><br>
Are you talking about the World Expo? I heard that Musashi chose Shinano to be on our delegation.<br>
Musashi must have a good reason for sending Shinano away. Otherwise...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
We're alone out here. You may speak your mind freely.<br>
The orders to send Shinano away might not have come directly from Musashi. Do you not think that's another possibility?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kongou：</span><br>
Well, it's possible. I just have my qualms about the idea of sending Shinano of all people out to Sardegna.<br>
I don't care if it's for the World Expo or just a courtesy visit. Shinano should not be part of it.<br>
Now that the Iron Blood has challenged the Sirens, nobody knows what will come next... It doesn't make sense for Shinano to be anywhere else but here in the Sakura Islands.<br>
Despite my concerns, I doubt the Naval HQ would impersonate Musashi... But if she did make this decision, I would like some answers. <br>
Speaking of Musashi, didn't you receive some sort of invitation from her the other day?<br>
With your reputation and standing, I'm sure you could ask her directly about Shinano.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
About that... I'd like to hear your honest opinion on something.<br>
I did receive an invitation from Musashi, but I'm not the sole invitee.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kongou：</span><br>
So it's a group invitation, huh? In other words, some kind of exercise?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
Not quite. It appears to be some sort of battle simulation "Chess" game.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kongou：</span><br>
Chess?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
Yes. Apparently, she has created a special "domain" to conduct her game and is inviting all members of the Reborn Combined Fleet to participate.<br>
That includes you, Kongou, so I'd like you to take a look at the invitation as well.<br>
<br>
Some time later...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kongou：</span><br>
I'm honored that Musashi mentioned me by name.<br>
But... aren't these rules a bit too convoluted for a naval exercise?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
Mmhmm. I thought the same thing, and I'm glad I'm not the only one.<br>
Having that said, I cannot just decline an invitation from Musashi. Even if this isn't a naval exercise, her words may well influence the future of the Sakura Empire.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kongou：</span><br>
It says three other people were invited as well. Do you have any guess as to who the two unnamed ones are?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
I spoke to Nagato earlier and she confirmed that she received an invitation.<br>
That leaves only one person. In all likelihood, Akagi.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kongou：</span><br>
Interesting. I can see this exercise turning into a two-versus-two with you and Nagato against Akagi and Musashi.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
Yes, which is why I wanted to discuss some tactics with you first.<br>
The team leaders will not be physically present on the field. We'll be playing the role of lords, issuing orders to retainers.<br>
Each leader will have five combatants assigned to her.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kongou：</span><br>
I see. It says here that I'll be your retainer, while Haruna and Hiei will go with Nagato.<br>
About this domain... It seems to confer special abilities to the ships that enter? Is that something that has already been determined? <br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
Correct. In other words, you'll each have a role to play.<br>
Even I will have access to certain abilities, in line with my role as a lord. They are a means for me to directly influence the battlefield.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kongou：</span><br>
A game of chess where the player can also serve as a piece... Interesting.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
That's right, haha. Who knows, maybe that design reflects a bit of the designer's intentions.<br>
Speaking of which, the domain is affected by the mental states of the outside participants, as well as by the passage of time. These will change the conditions for the combatants inside.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kongou：</span><br>
Time and mental state, you say...<br>
I think I understand what the purpose of this game is now.<br>
Musashi must want to test everyone to see which side – or should I say, ideology – can lead their followers to victory under pressure.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
I'm inclined to agree. It's a mock battle to determine the best path forward for the Sakura Empire.<br>
For us players, the battle has already begun.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kongou：</span><br>
Would you happen to know who came up with this idea? Was it Akagi? Or maybe Musashi herself?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
For all we know, it could've even been the Commander's idea. We won't be able to find out until we step inside that domain.<br>
All we can do for now is to plan, prepare, and practice for any and all possibilities.<br>
Someone will have to tell Nagato to do the same. You should... No, actually, I'll do it.<br>
Inform the 5th CarDiv on my behalf instead. Tell them to contact me at once if their investigation bears fruit.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kongou：</span><br>
Certainly. I'll let them know.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
Good. Anything they discover could bring a swifter end to this pointless infighting.<br>

3 Gathering of Dark Clouds<br>
Sakura Islands - The Great Library<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Sheesh, this library really has it all, from books you'll find anywhere to ancient tomes...<br>
Since there was nothing unusual in the confidential files, I guess my only option is to look through older documents.<br>
I'll at least know if someone's tampered with those. You can alter digital data without leaving a trace, but not so with physical paper and ink.<br>
<br>
Zuikaku trodded through great bookshelves forming long rows. Ancient works were lined up high, but her spirits were low.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Mikasa was totally right. Nearly every record covering the Sanctuary is inconsistent with the next.<br>
Same with any books touching on the Sacred Sakura and the Diadem of Light...<br>
There are records dating further back, but they're either the only copy known to exist, or the things written in them don't make sense.<br>
It's almost like somebody went and fabricated a bunch of stories...<br>
...As if they wanted to tamper with our legends.<br>
If so, how long have they been doing it?<br>
<br>
She continued rummaging through papers. Then, she suddenly heard the voice of a young girl.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kisaragi：</span><br>
Z-Zuikaku, are you looking for a book?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Kisaragi? I guess you could say that. You looking for one, too?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kisaragi：</span><br>
No... I-I just came to give you a message.<br>
{namecode:96}————<br>
"A storm is coming. You should head home soon."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
I see... Thanks. I'll get going as soon as I find the book I need.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kisaragi：</span><br>
Okay... I'm gonna leave then.<br>
Don't stay too long, okay?<br>
<br>
Zuikaku resumed reading. When she looked over her shoulder just a moment later, she saw Kisaragi had disappeared into the forest of literature.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
How'd she find her way here? That's kind of... Nah, I'm probably overthinking it.<br>
She's right about the storm thing. Looks like it's gonna rain. I'll buy an umbrella on my way home.<br>
...Gah, I'm getting distracted! Need to find something ASAP and tell Mikasa about it...<br>
<br>
Zuikaku put down the last in a series of documents and gazed out the window at darkly overcast skies.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Oh crap, I lost track of time.<br>
Guess that's enough reading for one day. I'll come back and read more tomorrow.<br>
It's really pouring down out there... I'll definitely want an umbrella before I head back.<br>
<br>
She put on her coat and began heading for the store. That's when a girl with an umbrella appeared from nowhere.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yura：</span><br>
You may use mine if you'd like.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Oh! Thanks, Yura! Whatcha here for? Looking for something to read?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yura：</span><br>
Not exactly. I've come to relay orders to you from Musashi.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Come again? Musashi?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yura：</span><br>
Yes. She wants you to travel to an Iron Blood base at once to serve as the Sakura Empire's representative there.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Talk about sudden... Where even is this base? And what am I supposed to say to them?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yura：</span><br>
Sadly, I don't know. However, I've been told you'll be sent further details after you depart.<br>
There's a car waiting outside for you. I suggest you get in, go to the port, and set sail as soon as you can.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Cruising in the rain isn't exactly my– Wait, what? I have to go NOW?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yura：</span><br>
Yes. Those are Musashi's direct orders.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Oookay then... I'll head out right away.<br>
(What's going on here? Why send me away now, Musashi?)<br>
(I'll have to tell Shoukaku to take over the investigation for me... I hope she can find something while I'm gone.)<br>
(Here's praying some of my good luck will come your way, Sis!)<br>

4 Faded Blossoms<br>
Sakura Islands islet - Nagato's Shrine<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
What a pitiful sight... It seems no one has repaired the shrine during my absence.<br>
<br>
The Sacred Sakura, once a symbol of worship for the Sakura Empire's encased shrine maiden, had been reduced to a withered, hollow husk.<br>
It was now an ink-stained steel sakura – a monolith that loomed silently over the land.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
It is here that I sealed myself away, heart heavy from the guilt of having embroiled my friends in war.<br>
I awoke once more thanks to the efforts of Mutsu, Zuikaku, Mikasa, and many more. But I was unable to save the "Sakura Empire."<br>
It is as Mikasa said. I am still lacking in wisdom and experience.<br>
Both as the guardian of the Sakura Empire's people, and as the flagship of the Combined Fleet.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kawakaze：</span><br>
Forgive me, Lady Nagato. So many tragedies could've been avoided had I taken you away from this place...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
Do not blame yourself. While it is true I was manipulated, the decision to encase myself in this tree was ultimately mine.<br>
Let us linger on the past no more and instead focus on the present.<br>
Shoukaku. Only those who have faith in me stand here today. Everything I say henceforth shall be true, sincere, and from my heart.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shoukaku：</span><br>
I understand. If I may ask, why did you lead me here? Mikasa and Zuikaku entrusted me with an investigation I've yet to finish.<br>
Is it something to do with the Sacred Sakura? If so, what?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
I shall answer your questions. Firstly, I must have an entourage of capital ships whenever I leave the mainland.<br>
Secondly, I chose you so that you wouldn't be sent elsewhere, like Zuikaku.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shoukaku：</span><br>
Like how she was sent as a representative to the Iron Blood, you mean?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
Indeed. I thought the orders were a Naval HQ forgery, but I spoke with Musashi and confirmed she issued them. Likewise with the orders Shinano received.<br>
By making you part of my escort, neither Musashi nor the Naval HQ can simply point and dispatch you somewhere else.<br>
All that is to say, you will be accompanying me until further notice.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shoukaku：</span><br>
Understood. What do you need me to do?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
We will take part in Musashi's "exercise," while deepening our investigation of the Watatsumi.<br>
As you'll remember, "Ember," who we now know as one of the Ashes, claimed that the Watatsumi we had at the Diadem of Light was a fake.<br>
I initially thought she was lying, but within a few days, we had definitive proof that the Watatsumi there indeed had been replaced with a replica.<br>
In other words, none of us at the ritual site were able to determine the difference between the real Watatsumi and a replica until the Ashes made us aware of it.<br>
Allegedly, the real Watatsumi was handed to Iron Blood, then later retrieved by Akagi. However, I suspect we once again will be unable to determine whether or not it is real.<br>
We have been conducting rituals using the Watatsumi for as long as we can remember, yet we somehow know nothing about its true nature or its origins.<br>
Who declared this stone an artifact of the Sakura Empire, and when?<br>
Who began the tale that using it as a catalyst could birth shipgirls free from the constraints of fate?<br>
What is the Watatsumi? What is the Sanctuary? We must find the answers to all of these questions.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kawakaze：</span><br>
...Lady Nagato, someone else seems to have tidied up the building ahead of us.<br>
It would seem that we're not the only ones who've been here recently.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
Hrmh... Something isn't right...<br>
(It feels as if an imperceptible barrier has been woven around the Sacred Sakura... Is it to impede our investigation?)<br>
Kawakaze, Shoukaku, be vigilant. I am going to search the husk of the tree.<br>
(Whatever this barrier hides, I shall expose it all.)<br>

<br>
5 Vessels and Replacements<br>
Somewhere in an undisclosed location...<br>
On an assembly line within a factory encased in walls of steel, elite Sirens were being put together, one after the next.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kii：</span><br>
So this is how it looks inside a Siren workshop, eh... It's nothing like how they make mass-produced ships.<br>
These aren't just ordinary humanoid Sirens, either – they're full-blown elite vessels.<br>
By the way, since when were we able to make Siren vessels?<br>
<span style="color:#a020f0;">???：</span><br>
Any workshop connected to the Mirror Sea's database can produce them. With the know-how, even the Sakura Empire in its current state can control these Sirens to some extent.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kii：</span><br>
Us? Controlling elite Sirens like any old mass-produced ship? Yeah, right.<br>
<span style="color:#a020f0;">???：</span><br>
I'm serious. *cough* *cough*... You should think of them as drones that follow orders rather than as your sworn enemies.<br>
While they may look the same on the outside, there is a world of difference between an empty vessel and the Siren inhabiting it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kii：</span><br>
Hah, alright. I'm just a little stunned it's possible to control elite Sirens. Appreciate the explanation.<br>
What do you say we end the tour here and take a little break? You could use one, what with how pale you look.<br>
<span style="color:#a020f0;">???：</span><br>
Don't worry about me. I know the limits of my own body... *cough* *cough*... What's important is making the most of what time we have left.<br>
I must see this plan through before it's too late... Now, I take it you recognize all the vessels?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kii：</span><br>
Sure do. Tester, Purifier, Compiler, and Omitter... Just like with the Pawns, they look the same as their originals.<br>
Hey, mind if I ask one last question?<br>
<span style="color:#a020f0;">???：</span><br>
Allow me to guess. "Why is there no Observer vessel?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kii：</span><br>
Huh, you read my mind...<br>
<span style="color:#a020f0;">???：</span><br>
The short answer is, the Observer program is unique.<br>
As the program oversees the other elite programs, Observer's vessels are constructed through an entirely different paradigm than the others.<br>
Even a rudimentary vessel is extremely difficult to make, and it requires prohibitively inefficient weapons that no other Siren can use.<br>
All in all, it's more effort than it's worth. You could practically consider her unreproducible.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kii：</span><br>
I see. So we'll be one person short...<br>
<span style="color:#a020f0;">???：</span><br>
Not necessarily. It wasn't easy, but I managed to build a replica of none other than...<br>
*cough* *cough*... Well, see for yourself.<br>
<br>
The workshop's spotlights converged on a place away from the Siren vessels, illuminating something – or maybe someone – that had been shrouded in darkness.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kii：</span><br>
Is... that...?<br>
<span style="color:#a020f0;">???：</span><br>
Yes. The thing you all need the most right now.<br>
A Pawn of someone close to Akagi, hosting the data of a high-ranking Siren––<br>

Sakura Islands - Near Tosa's residence<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kaga：</span><br>
Should be just past this bamboo grove... Still can't believe how desolate this place is.<br>
It's going to be strange seeing her again. It always is...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mutsuki：</span><br>
Hi, Kaga! Whatcha doing here?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kaga：</span><br>
Mutsuki? That's my question – why are YOU here?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mutsuki：</span><br>
To give out fireworks and candy! Oh, and deliver a message! Here, have a freebie!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kaga：</span><br>
I... see... Thanks. I see Inazuma and Ikazuchi are here, too.<br>
Listen. Tosa's not as nice as she lets on. If she's mean to you, you're welcome to be mean back.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mutsuki：</span><br>
If you say so! I'm going home now, though!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kaga：</span><br>
Alright. Careful so you don't trip.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mutsuki：</span><br>
Okey-dokey! Bye-bye!<br>
<br>
Sakura Islands - Near Tosa's residence<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kaga：</span><br>
(First I was converted to a carrier in Amagi's stead, then the Commander appeared and somehow changed the Reenactment, resulting in Tosa's survival...)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Inazuma：</span><br>
Good evening, Kaga. I'm afraid Tosa isn't home at the moment.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kaga：</span><br>
Not a problem. I can wait for her to come back.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ikazuchi：</span><br>
I see... The thing is, Tosa said nobody's allowed in without her permission.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Inazuma：</span><br>
Mutsuki visited just a while ago. It felt a bit awkward talking to her in front of the door, but rules are rules.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kaga：</span><br>
...Alright, I'll just wait outside then.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ikazuchi：</span><br>
I see, I see! You might be waiting for a long time, though. Tosa's been crazy busy with festival planning and stuff.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Inazuma：</span><br>
Arranging a fireworks display is very time-consuming. I doubt she'll even come home today.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kaga：</span><br>
(They're having a fireworks display here, in the middle of nowhere? That's news to me.)<br>
You don't happen to know when she'll be back, do you? I really need to talk to her.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ikazuchi：</span><br>
I see, I see! But I don't know. Do you, Inazuma?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Inazuma：</span><br>
I'm afraid not. Musashi might, however, so you could ask her.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ikazuchi：</span><br>
Ah, I see! If anyone would know where Tosa is, it'd be her!<br>
Just ask and she'll probably tell you!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kaga：</span><br>
Musashi, huh... I'll pay her a visit.<br>
Guess I'll be on my way then. You two be good, alright?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ikazuchi & Inazuma：</span><br>
- Buh-bye! - Safe travels.<br>

7 Divergent Paths<br>
Sakura Islands - Akagi's residence<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
From Compiler's defeat, to what we saw beyond the Singularity... Everything, my decisions included, followed Friedrich's plans to a T.<br>
As nice as it was to see the Commander, watching everyone dance to that woman's little tune... was just uncanny.<br>
<br>
Singularity - Inside the Mirror Sea<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
A perfect symphony requires each and every individual to play the right instrument correctly.<br>
To accomplish that, I must expand my horizons and seek out greater fidelity in my sounds.<br>
So I ask you, Akagi – will you be coming with me?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Sorry, but I'm no longer interested in your plans. You'll have to find yourself a new puppet. <br>
Your rondo may have reached its denouement, but I still have many, many things to do.<br>
This is farewell, Friedrich der Große.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
Very well. I have already seen our paths diverge.<br>
You seek to carve out a new future for those dear to you. You seek to regain that feeling of belonging that you've lost. You seek the warm embrace of the one you desire––<br>
Ah, what a discordant, contradiction-filled opus you are. Yet, your song may still please the audience.<br>
We shall meet again in another place. Until then, may you be in good health, Akagi. Heehee.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
The Watatsumi is back in our hands, we gained valuable intel on Iron Blood, and we learned a lot about the Commander.<br>
While we never reached the center of the NA Ocean, we also did not come home empty-handed.<br>
You've made your move, Friedrich. Now it's my turn.<br>
<br>
A shikigami taking the form of a bird shrouded in blue flames entered the room through the window, landing on the table in front of Akagi.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
A recorded message from Kaga? Interesting...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kaga：</span><br>
Sister, I wasn't able to meet with Tosa.<br>
I'm sorry... The fault lies entirely with me.<br>
I talked to Inazuma and Ikazuchi. They said Musashi would know where she is, and I likely have no other choice but to ask her directly.<br>
One more thing. I encountered Mutsuki on my way to Tosa's residence. She was apparently also there to speak to her.<br>
I'm led to believe someone may visit your residence soon, so bear that in mind. End of report.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
I see... It seems I've sent you on a difficult mission, Kaga.<br>
I wonder... What would've become of you and me, had the Commander not appeared at the right time?<br>
...Amagi, I'm sorry that I cannot be like you. This... This is just who I am...<br>
......<br>
Mutsuki... An old Sakura word that signifies a time of closeness between family.<br>
Ah, so that's what you wanted to tell me. That's why you sent her.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jintsuu：</span><br>
May I have a word, Akagi?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Gah! Jintsuu? What do you want?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jintsuu：</span><br>
Pardon me for interrupting you while you are busy. There's a girl at the door with a message from Musashi.<br>
Do I send her away, or shall I relay the message to you?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Let her in. It's an affront not to personally receive a message from Musashi.<br>
Ah, Musashi... I knew you'd do something like this sooner or later.<br>
Since you're sticking your neck out, it's time for me to put my own plan in motion.<br>
Yes. This is the start of a new play. Heehee, heeheehee...<br>
