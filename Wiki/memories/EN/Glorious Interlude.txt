A Glorious Interlude<br>
<br>
Chapter 1 - Her Name is Glorious<br>
Port - Commander's Office<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Glorious：</span><br>
Royal Navy aircraft carrier Glorious, reporting in. I have been assigned to serve as your secretary ship!<br>
Commander, I will do everything in my power to meet your expectations. I await your orders!<br>
I won't make the same mistake I did before. I will not let my guard down this time!<br>
<br>
一A Short Time Later——<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Glorious：</span><br>
Let's see what's on the schedule for this afternoon... Y-... Yes, of course! Exercises! I'll be participating as well!<br>
The supplementary materiel... Should have been delivered. I had Ardent go and confirm for me everything is in order... Hmm... I'm unsure...<br>
Yes, I've already put all of these documents in order! Indeed, yes, they're all here! ...The report from the Narvik operation? Um, er, I can't quite remember, I think it's done...<br>
 (whispering) Come on, Glorious, get it together. Show some of that Royal Navy glory...! You're the most storied ship of all...!<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Why are you trembling...?</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：Are you nervous about something...?</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Glorious：</span><br>
No, no I'm not nervous! ...Here, I found it! The Narvik report!<br>
<br>
The report was clearly complete, why didn't she remember it...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Glorious：</span><br>
You've clearly mistaken me for the Glorious from that fateful operation. While I understand your concern, I—<br>
I am that Glorious, and at the same time, she is not me.<br>
For the glory of the Royal Navy, I have been reborn as a new Glorious, and likewise, I will earn the greatest glory for you, Commander!<br>
<br>
*sparkle*<br>
Glorious seemed to shine with her own radiant glory.<br>

A Glorious Interlude<br>
<br>
Chapter 2 - Maritime Exercises<br>
Home Waters - Exercise Field<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lexington：</span><br>
All right, once again, today's exercise is an Eagle Union versus Royal Navy aircraft carrier practical exercise. The object is to strike all the Manjuu-piloted targets.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Glorious：</span><br>
Roger! You Eagle Union ships are so well-versed in the practical uses of the aircraft carrier. I'm looking forward to learning from you!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
You got it! Let Saratoga show you just what it means to be an aircraft carrier ♪<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
Hehehe, Professor Saratoga's class is in session~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lexington：</span><br>
First send out some reconnaissance planes to locate the... Glorious?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Glorious：</span><br>
While I may have fewer planes, I'll simply bring my 15-inch guns to bear on the... Oh? I'm an aircraft carrier...<br>
Aie, what am I doing out front by myself?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
Glorious, you've rushed out too quickly!<br>
<br>
Several Hours Later<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
All planes recovered! How about that? Saratoga does it again! Let's see you call me "Drydock Idol" now!<br>
Huh... Are you okay, Glorious?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Glorious：</span><br>
F- I'm fine! I've finally sunk all the targets!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
A bit touch and go there, wasn't it...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Glorious：</span><br>
Apologies, I didn't mean to be a bother...<br>
By the way, did Ark Royal ever show? She told me she'd be coming a little late today...<br>

<br>
Chapter 3 - The Queen Incident Pt. 1<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Glorious：</span><br>
Sorry to bother you, Commander. I'm just worried about Ark Royal...<br>
... Oh, there she is!!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ark Royal：</span><br>
I'm innocent, Commander! I was only concerned for the welfare of the little destroyer sisters going out on commission, so of course I sneaked off to escort them. I certainly wasn't stalking Warspite!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Warspite：</span><br>
I believe her, Ark Royal wouldn't do something so ignoble...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Silence! I saw it! Your sick smile. You were skulking around right behind Warspite!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ark Royal：</span><br>
I'm telling you, it had nothing to do with Warspite, I was after... I was escorting the destroyers behind her!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Belfast：</span><br>
If Your Majesty would permit a maid's suggestion, I believe we might investigate Ark Royal's pretext and determine its veracity...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
There is no need! This is circumstantial evidence! Not to mention your typical unseemly conduct, I cannot let this stand!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ark Royal：</span><br>
Commander! This, this isn't right! You must see!<br>
<br>
What troublesome thing had we stumbled upon...<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Pretend you saw nothing.</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：Maintain a safe distance and continue watching.</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Glorious：</span><br>
... Your Majesty, please!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Glorious?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Glorious：</span><br>
I can prove Ark Royal is innocent!<br>

<br>
A Glorious Interlude<br>
<br>
Chapter 4 - The Queen Incident Pt. 2<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Glorious：</span><br>
As for how I intend to prove Ark Royal's innocence, my case stands on three legs——<br>
First: Ark Royal originally intended to join our aircraft carrier exercises, and found herself sharing the path with the recently returned commission team, making it trivial for her to escort them.<br>
Second: Had Ark Royal truly intended to tail Lady Warspite, there is no way the Grand Old Lady would not have been able to perceive her actions.<br>
Lastly we have the question of motive... I firmly believe Ark Royal is a straightforward and upright individual, without a wicked bone in her body!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Warspite：</span><br>
Huh.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Huh.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Belfast：</span><br>
Huh.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Together：</span><br>
Huuh?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ark Royal：</span><br>
Glorious... You...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Glorious：</span><br>
I know what it's like to have little ones you care about, like little sisters to— No, they're even more important to me than a little sister.<br>
So I fully understand Ark Royal's impulse to cherish and protect the destroyers as one would a precious flower!<br>
“Complete the Mission and Leave No Man Behind”— Such is the duty of the battle fleet, and our core virtue in the Royal Navy!<br>
No doubt Ark Royal also keeps to these lofty ideals, and in this case she must have strove to spare Lady Warspite's pride from harm!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Together：</span><br>
......<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Hrm, hmph! Very well! Considering the lack of evidence, I suppose I'll let you off today! Get out of my sight, Ark Royal!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Warspite＆Belfast：</span><br>
Bless Your Majesty's wisdom.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ark Royal：</span><br>
Haha! I can't thank you enough, Glorious!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Glorious：</span><br>
Think nothing of it! Only a trifle. ... It was my pleasure to see you get off, Ark Royal.<br>
<br>
It was the beginning of a beautiful friendship (?).<br>

A Glorious Interlude<br>
<br>
Chapter 5 - The Destroyers<br>
Port - Workshop<br>
We received a request from Akashi to go to the workshop and sort through the stockpiled materiel and equipment.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ardent：</span><br>
Acasta, quit slacking off and come help! We promised to help Glorious, didn't we?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Acasta：</span><br>
Uuuughhh... I'm doing it... it's just really dusty over here...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Glorious：</span><br>
Hold up, I'll clean over there myself. Ardent and Acasta, you check these items against the manifest please.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Acasta：</span><br>
I feel like Glorious is just doing everything herself... We came here to help, but is this helping...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Glorious：</span><br>
Don't worry about it. This place was always very dusty, I'll take care of it. And of course, the Commander will help me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ardent：</span><br>
You sure you'll be okay, Glorious? There's a lot to do here.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Glorious and I can handle it ourselves.</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：Why don't you two stay and help.</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Glorious：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''We're fine. Listen to the Commander.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ardent：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''But...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Acasta：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Just let the Commander take care of it. Ardent, finish that up and let's head back.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Glorious：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Commander, they have things to do. We can take care of this ourselves...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ardent：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''It's fine! We came here to help you to begin with, Glorious...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Acasta：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Over here, Ardent... (whispering) ... Sure, we'll go take care of that.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Glorious：</span><br>
Thank you very much. ... All right, Commander, let's get to work!<br>
<br>
While the work itself wasn't terribly difficult, it did involve a lot of pieces of big equipment. It was a bit much even for an aircraft carrier like Glorious. ...I had a feeling there really wasn't much the destroyers could do.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Glorious：</span><br>
Rrrrghh... S-so heavy... Ahh... Aaahhh...<br>
<br>
Are you okay, Glorious...?<br>

A Glorious Interlude<br>
<br>
Chapter 6 - The Glory She's Named For Pt. 1<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Glorious：</span><br>
Haah... Now that that's done with...<br>
<br>
We had reached about the halfway point when an exhausted Glorious leaned against a huge rig to catch her breath.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Thanks for your hard work, Glorious.</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：Wordlessly offer her a cup of coolant.</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Glorious：</span><br>
Th-thank you! Sorry I'm not being very helpful...<br>
Huh? Are you trying to tell me you think you should have asked more people to help?<br>
You can't do that! Everyone's busy preparing for battle. That's so much more important!<br>
In fact, I didn't even want Ardent or Acasta coming to help. Not that they listen to me...<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：You can't force it.</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Glorious：</span><br>
Of course, I'm not forcing anything...<br>
I seem tired to you? Hm... Well, what can I say...?<br>
As the Royal Navy's Glorious aircraft carrier, the one everyone has come to rely on, such is my burden to bear, is it not?!<br>
<br>
Glorious was doing everything she could to put on a brave face. But—<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Glorious：</span><br>
Aye! Glorious, awaiting orders, Commander! Without hesitation, I execute your will!<br>
“Stop fronting”...? That's... an order, Commander? ... But...<br>
... I've always been so clumsy, I'm totally useless in battle, it's all I can do to make sure I'm not holding everyone else back!<br>
But if that's an order, Commander... Then...!<br>

A Glorious Interlude<br>
<br>
Chapter 7 - The Glory She's Named For Pt. 2<br>
As she saw it, the most important thing was for her to be the bringer of victory, the "Glorious" that everyone could depend on. But—<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Glorious：</span><br>
“At least stop fronting when I'm alone with the Commander.” You mean...<br>
You think I can't become your pride, your glory, then...?<br>
<br>
That's not what I said.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Glorious：</span><br>
Then... What should I do...?<br>
I shine my glory before the others, but when I'm with you, I don't have to...?<br>
... Woah...<br>
<br>
I took her hand and pulled her to the seat next to me.<br>
The truth was, I had sent a message off to the others that they should come over to help out once they finished their meeting.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Glorious：</span><br>
That means, when I'm with the Commander, I can be weak, I can be vulnerable, I can be unreliable, I can pout—<br>
This way, I can keep shining my glory before all the others—<br>
Can a clumsy and careless Glorious still be the Commander's glory?<br>
I, I...<br>
<br>
There was a trembling in Glorious's voice.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Glorious：</span><br>
I understand. It is an order from the Commander, after all—<br>
<br>
She relaxed her grip on my hand and on my shoulder I felt the weight of a young girl.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Glorious：</span><br>
Orders received, Commander. ... As your glory, I-I'm going to indulge myself for a bit.<br>
Do you mind... if I take a little rest... Before the others get here?<br>
<br>
The soft sounds of her peaceful sleep echoed throughout the empty workshop…<br>
