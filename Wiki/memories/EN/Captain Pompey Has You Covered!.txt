Captain Pompey Has You Covered!<br>
<br>
1 The All-Capable Secretary<br>
As the morning sunlight peeked in through the office windows, there was a soft knock on the office door.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pompeo Magno：</span><br>
Captain Pompey the Great has arrived! I'll be serving as your secretary, moving forward.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Good morning. You came at just the right time.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pompeo Magno：</span><br>
Of course! So, what's on the schedule today? Not that it matters, I'll take care of it all!<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：If you're sure. It's all up to you!</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：Well, things will be a little different today...</span>'''''<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''And so, the Commander left the port to go on a one-day business trip.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Pompeo was left all by herself and, as the acting secretary, had to deal with each and every one of the port's issues for the day.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pompeo Magno：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''What?! Hey! W-wait, Commander!<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''In a panic, Pompeo hurried after the Commander.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pompeo Magno：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Meaning, there's much work to be done? Don't worry! With me by your side, it'll be done before you know it!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''While that's reassuring, by "things" I mean that I have to leave on a business trip today.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''I'll be away until tomorrow, and I need you to look after the port in my absence.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pompeo Magno：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Okay! I can do that!<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''......<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Wait, YOU'LL BE GONE A WHOLE DAY?!<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''I give Pompeo a series of encouraging pats on the shoulder.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''I've already made arrangements for almost everything, but it's possible I forgot something or made an error.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''If something urgent comes up, use your authority as the secretary to resolve it.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''You can message me if you absolutely need my approval on something, but I might not reply immediately if I'm in an important meeting.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pompeo Magno：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''B-but I'm just... I can't...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''You can. People say nothing but good things about you. You're reliable and capable.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pompeo Magno：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Really? They say that about me?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''You bet they do.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pompeo Magno：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Hah! Well, if it's my help you need, then you shall get it!<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Leave it all to me! I promise on my great name that I'll finish everything flawlessly!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Great. I'm counting on you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pompeo Magno：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''As you should! Rest assured, nothing will go awry on my watch!<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''(Though I wish I could have you by my side...)<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Hmm? Did you say something?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pompeo Magno：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''N-nope, nothing! When are you leaving?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''In just a minute. Could you get me my briefcase?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pompeo Magno：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Sure, here. Good luck, and I'll see you when you come back.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Thanks. Remember, you're in charge now. Don't let me down!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pompeo Magno：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Please don't put more pressure on me than there already is!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Hahah! Alright, it's time for me to go.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pompeo Magno：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Just a sec! Let me come along and see you off!<br>
<br>
A soft breeze fluttered a curtain as Pompeo left the office and closed the door behind her.<br>
Chatting casually, she and the Commander walked through the corridor, their voices growing more and more distant.<br>

<br>
2 Your Signature Here<br>
Port - Office<br>
Pompeo Magno sat behind the desk. Her arms crossed, she was brooding over something.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pompeo Magno：</span><br>
This is lousy.<br>
I thought "being in charge" and "looking after the port" meant doing something...<br>
All I'm doing is keeping the bench warm!<br>
No, no, I can't think like that. The Commander trusted me and asked me for help.<br>
Need to get it together... L-let's have a look at this paperwork to be done.<br>
<br>
There were two stacks of documents in front of her. One was a true pile of documents, with labels attached to them visible from the side.<br>
The other stack was much thinner, and the topmost paper had a sticky note attached to it that read, "Due today."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pompeo Magno：</span><br>
Here we are. Let's see here...<br>
Uhh... Um...<br>
What did the Commander say I should do with these, again?<br>
Right, I never asked about that...<br>
You know what? I'll leave this for later. In the meantime, there's the...<br>
..."Port Hygiene Inspection Report"?<br>
"Please sign here if the report's findings are satisfactory."<br>
That's all I have to do? Pfft, easy-peasy! Let me do that right awa–<br>
<br>
Pompeo's hand stopped abruptly before the pen touched the paper.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pompeo Magno：</span><br>
Hang on! Whose name am I supposed to write? My own? Or should I write, "Commander checked and approved"?<br>
Doesn't the document become invalid if I write my name on it? But it doesn't feel right to write, "The Commander says it's fine" either...<br>
I-I'll leave this one for later, too.<br>
Let's see what's next...<br>
<br>
Captain Pompey put her all into processing the paperwork due that day.<br>
And after all that effort, the pile had not shrunk even one bit.<br>

<br>
3 Way Over Budget<br>
*knock knock*<br>
There was a knock on the office door.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
Commander, you there? It's me, da Vinci!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pompeo Magno：</span><br>
Da Vinci?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
Hm? Is that you, Pompey?<br>
<br>
The door opened, and into the office stepped da Vinci, the local inventor.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
Hey, Comma– Huh? You're the only one here? Where's the Commander?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pompeo Magno：</span><br>
Out on a business trip. Left the port just this morning.<br>
If you need anything, it's Captain Pompey you should talk to!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
Ahh. You're the acting secretary today.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pompeo Magno：</span><br>
That I am! So, since you're here, what is it you need? Don't be shy, tell me and I'll have it done in a flash!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
Heheheh... The Commander's not here, eh...<br>
Ahem. See, there's actually a favor I wanna ask of you.<br>
It's about a grant. Remember the Doggo Cattron 3000 I made a while back?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pompeo Magno：</span><br>
You mean that cat toy that barks like a dog?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
Yeah, that one!<br>
But it's not a toy, you hear? It's the culmination of my hard work!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pompeo Magno：</span><br>
...So, what about it?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
Well, I wanna mass-produce it!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pompeo Magno：</span><br>
Okay...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
And to do that, I'm gonna need some money. I figure about this much...<br>
<br>
Using her index finger, da Vinci wrote out a number in the palm of Pompeo's hand.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pompeo Magno：</span><br>
......<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
Whaddya think? Can you do it?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pompeo Magno：</span><br>
Request rejected!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
Awww! Why?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pompeo Magno：</span><br>
That grant is the most insane ask I've ever heard!<br>
Do you even realize how many digits that is?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
You're only saying that because you don't see the genius of my invention.<br>
The Commander would say yes in a heartbeat!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pompeo Magno：</span><br>
The Commander would reject it before you were halfway done writing!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
You don't know that! Nothing is impossible! Anyone would approve it if they just knew what's so innovative about the Doggo Cattron 3000!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pompeo Magno：</span><br>
Doesn't matter, because the answer is no! Hell no!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
Come ooon, Pompeo! Don't be such a naysayer. All I need is one little seal of approval!<br>
Lend me an inkling of your time and I'll make you see why this project is so important!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pompeo Magno：</span><br>
Rejected, and that's my final answer!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
Pleeease, Captain Pompey the Great!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pompeo Magno：</span><br>
No, no, and again, NO!<br>
<br>
The "negotiation" between the two went on for quite some time.<br>

<br>
4 Why in the Library?<br>
Sometime later...<br>
Sat at the desk, coddled by the warm afternoon sunlight, Pompeo began drifting off to sleep.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pompeo Magno：</span><br>
Just a short break to rest my eyes...<br>
Mmh... I guess I dozed off.<br>
At least it's not even been an hour... It would've affected my work if I'd slept any longer.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">???：</span><br>
Zzz...<br>
<br>
Pompeo heard gentle snoring coming from somewhere. She bent forward over the desk and searched for the source.<br>
And there she was, on the couch, sound asleep.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pompeo Magno：</span><br>
...Impero?<br>
Hey. Impero. Wake up.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Impero：</span><br>
Mghh...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pompeo Magno：</span><br>
Come on, wake up. When did you even get here?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Impero：</span><br>
*yaaawn*... I heard you'd been appointed the secretary for today, so I came to have a look.<br>
I knocked several times to no response, so I came in and saw you sleeping like a baby at the desk.<br>
So I thought, "Screw it, I'll just have a nap too."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pompeo Magno：</span><br>
Makes sense... Wait, no! Why did you come here in the first place? What business did you have with me?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Impero：</span><br>
Oh, I remember now. I was gonna ask you to install beds in the library.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pompeo Magno：</span><br>
Excuse me? Beds?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Impero：</span><br>
Yup. I fall asleep when I read, and Littorio's always bugging me about how I'll catch a cold if I keep that up.<br>
So, if we put beds in the library, I could sleep under a warm blanket and not have to listen to any nagging.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pompeo Magno：</span><br>
......<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Impero：</span><br>
Is that a "no"?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pompeo Magno：</span><br>
It's not. First of all, though, please sleep in the Sardegnian dorm and not here. I'll write your request down and present it to the Commander.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Impero：</span><br>
*yawn*... Thanks. Then if you'll excuse me, I'm gonna resume my nap.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pompeo Magno：</span><br>
I just asked you not to...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Impero：</span><br>
Hey, this couch is comfy.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pompeo Magno：</span><br>
*sigh*... Fine, whatever. Let me get a blanket for you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Impero：</span><br>
Thanks. You're a good secretary.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pompeo Magno：</span><br>
Heheh...<br>

5 You're Not Alone!<br>
Sometime later again...<br>
Although at a snail's pace and with missteps along the way, Pompeo was chipping away at the pile of documents.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pompeo Magno：</span><br>
To think the Commander has to go through this much time-consuming work every single day...<br>
I never noticed just how much it was, despite working here for so long.<br>
Now that I'm processing it myself, the sheer volume of work to do is really sinking in.<br>
Whew... Let's see how much is left to do...<br>
<br>
Seeing how much remained, her morale took a nosedive.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pompeo Magno：</span><br>
I-I've not even made a dent in it!<br>
There is no way I can finish this by myself...<br>
The Commander said I'm reliable and capable, that people say good things about me...<br>
If the Commander finds out THIS is all I managed to do, I'm so done for... Everyone's going to hate me...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">???：</span><br>
Nobody is going to hate you, Pompeo.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pompeo Magno：</span><br>
Yeah, they will... I was expressly trusted with this job, and I'm failing fantastically...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">???：</span><br>
Think about it this way – the Commander doesn't work alone, so why should you have to?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pompeo Magno：</span><br>
What are you suggesting?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">???：</span><br>
It's quite simple...<br>
<br>
The source of the voice stepped forth and gently moved aside the documents obscuring Pompeo's view.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Aquila：</span><br>
That when something seems impossible on your own, you should ask someone for help in good time.<br>
That's right – I'm here to assist.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pompeo Magno：</span><br>
Aquila...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Aquila：</span><br>
I know you're in a bit of a pinch, and I'd like to ease your burden.<br>
Is there any work I can help with?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pompeo Magno：</span><br>
Thank god you're here...<br>
Yeah, there's tons! For a start, could you review these documents for me?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Aquila：</span><br>
These, you mean? Sure thing.<br>
By the way... Da Vinci said she'd stop by to help in a while.<br>
She had gone around claiming that you'll permit anything while the Commander is absent, which is why Impero came to visit you earlier. She shouldn't have done that.<br>
Don't worry, though. I've already nipped that rumor in the bud.<br>
And let's just say I "asked" da Vinci to come help as a way of atoning.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pompeo Magno：</span><br>
Thanks for doing that. Dealing with her was a pain because she just wouldn't back down.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Aquila：</span><br>
Think nothing of it. Also, shouldn't you be working now? I believe these documents are due today, so...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pompeo Magno：</span><br>
Ugh... We've got a long road ahead of us.<br>

<br>
6 Teamwork Makes the Dream Work<br>
Evening was drawing near. Though it took considerable effort, the girls eventually managed to escort the sleepyhead Impero to her dorm room.<br>
Now the three remaining Sardegnians were waging war on the hill of paperwork to be finished before the day.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pompeo Magno：</span><br>
Da Vinci, have we gotten inventory on the depot yet?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
Not yet. Akashi said there's just too much stuff in there, so it's gonna take a while longer.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pompeo Magno：</span><br>
It's been three days since the lights in the academy's corridor broke. Why haven't they been replaced yet?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Aquila：</span><br>
Oh, one of the documents mentioned that. Ingraham was in charge of maintenance that day, but then she got assigned an urgent mission.<br>
She missed the opportunity to replace them as a result.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pompeo Magno：</span><br>
Okay then. Da Vinci, do you reckon you could do it?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
Sure. I'm on it~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pompeo Magno：</span><br>
Wait, right! I need to issue you a certificate of supplies withdrawn. Where was that again...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Aquila：</span><br>
Here. I've already filled one out.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pompeo Magno：</span><br>
Oh! You're way ahead of me!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
Alrighty, I'd better head to the academy before it gets dark.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pompeo Magno：</span><br>
Take care!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
Will do!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pompeo Magno：</span><br>
Now for the next thing to deal with...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Aquila：</span><br>
Apropos of nothing, I heard from Veneto that when signing documents, the secretary may use either her name or simply write, "Request approved."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pompeo Magno：</span><br>
In that case, I'll write Captain Pompey the Great!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Aquila：</span><br>
Umm... I'm not sure that will fly with the admiralty.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pompeo Magno：</span><br>
Oh... Okay, I'll just write Pompeo Magno, then!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Aquila：</span><br>
There we go. Just sign here and you should be good.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pompeo Magno：</span><br>
Pompeo... Magno... There! Okay, next.<br>
<br>
Thanks to everyone's efforts, Captain Pompey the Great had evaded the fate of a forced all-nighter... or did she?<br>

7 It's Not a Toy!<br>
Office - The following day<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Pompey?<br>
Pompey, are you in there?<br>
<br>
No response. Time to go in and check.<br>
On the desk by the window, papers lie organized into neat stacks.<br>
Several cute little smiles have been drawn on the sticky note that reads, "Due today."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pompeo Magno：</span><br>
Zzzzz...<br>
<br>
Pompeo is asleep on the couch. I softly walk over and adjust her blanket for her.<br>
She looks so sweet, sleeping with her cap substituting for an eye mask. An urge to mess with her crosses my mind.<br>
I reach towards her hat, but before I can take it off...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pompeo Magno：</span><br>
Hey! My cap is not a toy!<br>
<br>
At just the right time, she wakes up and dexterously puts her cap back on.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pompeo Magno：</span><br>
Commander, you're back!<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Sure am.</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
What are you doing, sleeping in my office?<br>
Don't tell me you had to work late to finish everything.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pompeo Magno：</span><br>
Not at all! Getting it done was a piece of cake.<br>
Well, not really... In truth, I have Aquila and da Vinci to thank for helping me.<br>
Oh, sorry if I wasn't clear – we got the work done way ahead of time!<br>
The reason I slept in the office was so I could welcome you back as soon as possible!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I knew messaging Aquila was the right call.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pompeo Magno：</span><br>
Messaging Aquila? You mean...?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
A certain someone here did promise on her great name that she'd finish everything flawlessly.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pompeo Magno：</span><br>
Commander...<br>
<br>
A blush takes shape on her face.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Either way, you did a great job. What do you say we go get breakfast?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pompeo Magno：</span><br>
Sure!<br>
Wait, one thing! I can't go outside just like that. I need to wash my face first.<br>
I'll be done in 30 minutes... no, 20!<br>
<br>
She hurries out of the office to find a bathroom somewhere.<br>
I take a seat at my desk and pick up the note with the smiling faces drawn on it.<br>
The next time I get called on a sudden business trip, she'll manage to hold the fort even better.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pompeo Magno：</span><br>
Okay, I'm ready, Commander!<br>
<br>
She returns with a lightness in her gait.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
THAT was quick. Didn't you say you'd need 20 minutes?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pompeo Magno：</span><br>
Heehee... I'm always faster than the estimate!<br>
By the way, shouldn't Captain Pompey the Great expect something more than just breakfast as thanks for her hard work?<br>
I think I deserve something, you know... great.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Very well, Captain Pompey – what is your desire?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pompeo Magno：</span><br>
Ahem. I'm glad you asked! I don't ask for much. All I want is 24 hours by your side!<br>
Which is to say, I want to spend this shared day off together with you!<br>
And not just for breakfast, but for lunch, teatime, dinner... and whatever comes after that, too!<br>
Got it, Commander?<br>
If so, you need only present thy appendage! Come on, give me your hand~<br>
<br>
As she asks, I extend my hand.<br>
She extends her own as well, locking her fingers with mine. Our palms touch.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Uh...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pompeo Magno：</span><br>
This is a part of my reward, silly. Heehee~<br>
Now, let us set off on our magnificent date together!<br>
