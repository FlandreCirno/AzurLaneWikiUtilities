*bum bum bum!*<br>
With a powerful, rhythmic drum beat, the curtain rises, revealing a huge box on stage.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
Dazzling light, wavering dreams... How did the magic that allowed this one to appear before you in an instant look to your eyes?<br>
A shower of confetti bursts as a spotlight lights up the box and the girl inside. When we lock eyes, she smiles sweetly.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：It's awesome!</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：How did you do that?</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Very unique! I like it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''This one is glad that you enjoyed it... Welcome to the dreamscape this one has crafted just for us...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Help me figure this out. Did you come into my dreams again, or something?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Yes... This one entered your dream and created this magical stage for you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
Ah... Something very important nearly slipped my mind...<br>
Shinano slowly raises her hand and flashes a playful little peace sign.<br>
The destroyers taught me that this "peace sign" should convey joy to you...<br>
She tries to move inside the glass box, but her tail takes up so much space that it's hard for her to get anywhere.<br>
Alas... The box is a little more cramped than this one intended. Apologies...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
But aren't we in a dream? Can't you just make it bigger at will?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
The secrets of my magic are hidden in this box... If this one so readily adjusted it, the mystery would be gone...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
Hmm? So there is a mechanism, huh?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
If you wish to know... then come closer and look...<br>
I go up to the stage and look around the box, but I find no obvious mechanism.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
(Nothing around the box... Does that mean the mechanism is the glass itself?)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
After I finish investigating, I circle back and stand in front of Shinano, her drowsy yet still enchanting eyes never leaving me for a moment.<br>
Curious, I gently place my hand on the glass separating us.<br>
She does the same, her hand overlapping mine.<br>
She leans in closer, and her warm breath fogs up the glass...<br>
And her enigmatic ocean-blue eyes shimmer with tender affection.<br>
Did you find it now...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
No, not yet.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
Heehee... Then why not come inside...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
Inside the box? But how am I supposed to get it open if I don't know the trick?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shinano ：</span><br>
The glass in front of me suddenly turns into soft, dissipating particles of light.<br>
With her support gone, Shinano falls forward. Her soft, slender fingers intertwine with mine.<br>
I feel her warmth and softness through the sheer cloth.<br>
This is the true mechanism, Commander...<br>
The stage lights around us gradually dim, and her fluffy tail wraps around us.<br>
And our dream has only just begun...<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Napoli：</span><br>
I'll just lie here for a while. Thank you, Commander...<br>
I lend my shoulder to Napoli and help her lie down on the poker table.<br>
Her cheeks are delicately flushed a soft pink, and her eyes hold a hesitant, almost dreamy gaze as she looks intently at me.<br>
Sorry... I'm the one who asked you to teach me poker, and now I can't even focus...<br>
Why am I so dizzy all of a sudden?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
Are you actually a lightweight?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Napoli：</span><br>
Huh? A lightweight...?<br>
Napoli cocks her head and glances at the drink next to her.<br>
...Was that drink alcoholic?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
Oh. You didn't know?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Napoli：</span><br>
No... I've had drinks that tasted similar before, so I just thought it was one of those...<br>
But now that I'm looking at it, the packaging is a little different...<br>
I'm really sorry, Commander. Am I causing trouble for you again?<br>
Ugh, just like always...<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：I don't mind at all.</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：I like being relied on.</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''It's fine. I don't feel troubled in the slightest.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Not at all. I'm happy that you are willing to rely on me.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Besides, you're hardly causing me trouble to begin with.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Napoli：</span><br>
I appreciate that, but I can't rely on you forever...<br>
She puts a hand on the poker table and tries to support herself.<br>
But she loses balance and falls again. Then, she grabs my sleeve.<br>
I'm sorry... I'm still a little dizzy.<br>
You have work to attend to, don't you? Please, just go back. There's no need to waste all your time on me...<br>
There's some sadness in her voice.<br>
I'll be fine by myself. Just means I'll be stuck resting here for a while...<br>
She lets go of my sleeve, and then grabs my hand... Our palms share a quiet warmth.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：I'm staying with you.</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：I worry too much to do that.</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''I'll be right here. I'd be worried if I left you alone.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Who cares about work? Some overtime will fix that. Right now, my focus is solely on you.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Don't worry. I'm staying.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Napoli：</span><br>
The glaze in her eyes fades a little.<br>
Her long eyelashes flutter as she blinks, hiding the faint sparkle in her eyes.<br>
She presses her soft cheek against my palm and nuzzles it, like a bunny in need of pets.<br>
In that case... Please stay right by my side, Commander...<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Admiral Nakhimov：</span><br>
Commander, are my expression and pose adequate? If you have any advice, please tell me.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：(Suggest she adjust her pose.)</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：(Suggest she adjust her facial expression.)</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''If you lower your left leg a little, it should fit into the frame much better.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Try smiling a little more?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
Overall, I think you'd benefit from relaxing a bit.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Admiral Nakhimov：</span><br>
After the first round of filming, Nakhimov relaxes and stretches in place.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
You tired?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Admiral Nakhimov：</span><br>
I'm okay. I was more nervous, if anything.<br>
But it's a good thing you came, Commander.<br>
Before, I just couldn't get into the swing of things...<br>
Phew... Still, why did everyone choose me to be the star of this promo video?<br>
I'd think there are plenty of cuter, more appropriate girls for it.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：You're plenty appropriate.</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：You say that as if you're not cute.</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Admiral Nakhimov：</span><br>
Oh... Okay.<br>
Though she still has that collected expression, she looks away, as if to avoid my gaze. Her cat ears gently bounce with the movement.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
By the way, everyone else has bunny ears. Why did you get singled out with cat ears?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Admiral Nakhimov：</span><br>
These aren't cat ears. They're observation equipment.<br>
That aside...<br>
I picked them because I thought they suited me. You like how they look on me too, don't you?<br>
Her tone may be as calm as ever, yet I can't help but notice the faint blush painting her cheeks.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：I do love some cat ears.</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：Whatever you like, I like.</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Cat ears are perfectly fine. Want to try the bunny ears next time?<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Though I'm sure anything will look cute on you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''I have no preference. Wear whatever you want, really.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Because you're cute no matter what.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Admiral Nakhimov：</span><br>
Okay, I understand.<br>
In that case...<br>
Suddenly, something seems to wrap around my arm.<br>
Her "tails" have wriggled over and clung to me.<br>
Huh?! W-wait, my cables...!<br>
Don't get all grabby just because I feel happy, darn it!<br>
After her "tails" releases me, she becomes even more visibly nervous.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
(At this rate, I don't think she'll be able to focus on her next round of filming.)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Admiral Nakhimov：</span><br>
While I think about how I can calm her down, I notice her adjusting her "cat ears."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
That's it!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Admiral Nakhimov：</span><br>
What is it, Commander?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
(It's time to show off the ultimate petting skills I learned at the cat café!)<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：(Pet her head.)</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：(Scratch her chin.)</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Admiral Nakhimov：</span><br>
Mm...<br>
And it works – she seems to practically lose herself in the moment. Her eyes close with a look of pure contentment, and her eyelashes tremble ever so slightly...<br>
Thus, the petting session continues for quite a while...<br>
Commander... Meeeow♡<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Halford：</span><br>
Here is your seat, dear guest. I'll join you for a treat, a chat, or whatever you'd like~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
Hm?<br>
(Is it just me, or does she look dead inside?)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Halford：</span><br>
I look Halford up and down. Despite the sickly-sweet smile on her face, there isn't a sign of vigor in those eyes.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
(She loves work, though. That's odd.)<br>
(Is Akashi threatening her or something?)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Halford：</span><br>
...What are you staring at?<br>
She stops smiling and puffs out her cheeks unhappily, meeting my gaze.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
Just wondering what dirt Akashi has on you. Otherwise, you wouldn't be acting so weird.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Halford：</span><br>
None! Akashi has nothing to do with it. I just...<br>
She sighs, squeezes her plushie Dora, and hesitates for a moment.<br>
I'm just a little uneasy because of how easy this job is...<br>
I mean, all they want me to do is sit here and talk with you all sweetly.<br>
It hardly feels worthy of a reward...<br>
Besides, talking to you is already reward enough. Who considers this actual work?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：What if you just don't treat it as work?</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''If that's how you feel, then forget about the whole "work" thing entirely.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Just consider it a friendly chat with me, and maybe you'll be able to relax a little?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Halford：</span><br>
Hmm... That does sound like it would work...<br>
...Nuh-uh, no way! Work is work. I will not mix work with personal matters!<br>
I will have you know that I take my work very seriously!<br>
After learning what my job is about, I agonized over which plushies would be perfect for this occasion and even put hours into training them!<br>
She holds her plushie in front of her face in an effort to cover up her embarrassment.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
You were training your plushies? What, do they talk, too?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Halford：</span><br>
I didn't mean it literally! Of course they don't talk! I carefully dressed them up.<br>
Halford's Arts of Healing, Article 1: Soothe my servant with cute things.<br>
...So? Do you feel soothed by my adorable little Dora?<br>
If this isn't enough... th-then choose whatever you like instead!<br>
...Until you are healed and happy!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
So I can choose anything I want in here?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Halford：</span><br>
Of course!<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Then... can I choose you?</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
Does that mean I can choose you, Halford? I mean, you're on the couch too.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Halford：</span><br>
Huh?!<br>
She screams out of surprise. When she understands what I'm getting at, though, she gets even more embarrassed. Her cheeks turn a rosy red.<br>
I am no plushie! I'm the 127th lord of a bloodline who rides upon the night sea!<br>
And you are my servant! How... How dare you make such a request...!<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：I'm just kidding.</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：But you said I could.</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Sorry, sorry. I just wanted to tease you since you were talking about your job and your uneasiness.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Do you feel a little better now?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Halford：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''What? It was all a joke...?<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Hmph! Well, I'm going to take it seriously!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''You gave me permission, though.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Did you not say I could choose anything I wanted in here?<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''"Anything" does not mean "only plushies," as I recall.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Halford：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Commander, you little...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Halford：</span><br>
With her cheeks puffed angrily, Halford stands up... and plops down right into my lap.<br>
Her soft bunny ears graze my cheek, and she buries her beet-red face into my shoulder.<br>
Dear guest... Does this soothe and satisfy you?<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
(This should be the spot where the newly approved pop-up was constructed.)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Daisen：</span><br>
*CREEEAK!*<br>
An odd noise interrupts my train of thought. When I look to investigate...<br>
Oh, Commander? What brings you here?<br>
I see Daisen lying on the platform, her legs tangled in the red cord used in decorations.<br>
With every slight movement of her legs, the red cord tugs, causing the attached decorations to sway and emit a faint sound.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
Daisen? Uh, what's going on...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Daisen：</span><br>
Ah... I'm so sorry you had to see me in this weird state.<br>
I wanted to hang some decorations here to liven up the new construction, but I was... well, careless, in a word.<br>
Please forgive me for being too indisposed to show proper hospitality.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
Don't worry about it. I doubt you'll be able to get out of this bind yourself. Want some help?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Daisen：</span><br>
I'm so sorry to trouble you, Commander...<br>
She breathes a sigh of genuine relief.<br>
Who knows how long I would be tied up here if you hadn't arrived?<br>
As I approach the platform, it becomes evident that things are much worse than I'd expected.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
Is there anything I should watch out for? Like, am I going to bring the decorations crashing down?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Daisen：</span><br>
It's okay. I already made a mess of it, anyway...<br>
I can fix it all after.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
Got it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Daisen：</span><br>
I begin carefully untying the red cord.<br>
Her skin bears faint red marks, a subtle sign that she's been tied up for quite some time.<br>
The dark-red cords and the pinkish-red marks on her fair skin make for a striking contrast.<br>
Commander...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
Sorry. Did that hurt?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Daisen：</span><br>
No. It's just... that you don't have to be so gentle.<br>
Be rougher if you want... I'll be just fine.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：No, I think this needs a steady hand.</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：The last thing I want is for you to get hurt.</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Let me take it slow and steady. I'd feel awful if I ruined your decorations.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''You put your heart into this work, and it wouldn't be right to put that effort to waste.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Most of all, though, I don't want to see you hurt.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''I don't want to hurt you.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Besides, you worked really hard to get this done. Let's not put that to waste.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Daisen：</span><br>
Oh, my... Okay.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
Almost done. Lift your legs a little for me?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Daisen：</span><br>
Um... Like this?<br>
She lifts her legs higher for me, allowing me to untangle the last of the mess.<br>
Thank you so much, Commander.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
Don't mention it. By the way, the application paper called this the prayer space, right?<br>
Why did you think to add a prayer space in the shop?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Daisen：</span><br>
Well... Akashi said it was "trendy." And something about it being a "viral spot" for the shipgirls...?<br>
Also, she had some kind of plan to raffle off the opportunity of being the first to pray here...?<br>
Though I don't think she'll be able to do that ♪<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
Why's that?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Daisen：</span><br>
Because I already prayed while I was decorating.<br>
"May the Commander be safe and sound – and may I always be by your side."<br>
