...<br>
<br>
Upon entering Rumey's temporary office, my jaw hits the floor.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fritz Rumey：</span><br>
It is decked out with classical furnishings and decorative swords and rifles... And there are stacks of prop bills scattered on the floor.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
(She said she's been watching mafia movies... Seems she has seen one too many.)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fritz Rumey：</span><br>
Have a seat, Commander.<br>
As told, I sit down in the chair next to her.<br>
She picks up a folder from the small table nearby and hands it to me.<br>
I summoned you for one purpose – to interview you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
Uh, interview me?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fritz Rumey：</span><br>
This time around, I am the manager of our shop – the "boss bunny," in other words.<br>
It is therefore my duty to know the thoughts of our sole and most valued customer.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
So what's in the folder? A list of questions?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fritz Rumey：</span><br>
No, these are the shop's new rules that I came up with. The purpose of this interview is to hear your opinions.<br>
The rules should suffice, I think. If you feel anything is missing, I'll add it right away.<br>
Every little detail has to be perfectly tailor-made for you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
Alright then...<br>
Fritz Rumey：<br>
I open the folder and skim its contents.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
"Punch the clock when you start and finish work. 'I got lost' or 'I was tired' are not valid excuses for arriving late or leaving early"...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fritz Rumey：</span><br>
Performance reviews are fundamental to running a shop. If employees cannot arrive on time, they won't be able to provide you with proper service.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
"All activities outside of your job duties are prohibited during your shift"...<br>
Um, what does this "Whether intentional or not" note here mean?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fritz Rumey：</span><br>
It's possible to slack off even if you don't mean to. For instance, feeding the cats may result in non-work-related activities.<br>
Obviously, slacking off on purpose is prohibited. Unintentional distractions, however, can be prevented by asking others for help when needed.<br>
As if to punctuate her statement, she smacks the floor with the decorative sword in her hand.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
As rules go, strictly speaking, it all seems fine...<br>
But... I think a more relaxed, easy-to-work-in environment would be better for the shop.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fritz Rumey：</span><br>
Rejected. The staff cannot provide you with the best possible service under casual circumstances.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
Personally, I think you ought to take it easy.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fritz Rumey：</span><br>
Come again?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
I know you care about my feelings, but you should value your own, too.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fritz Rumey：</span><br>
She is left uncharacteristically at a loss for words.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
Don't let rules and conventions limit you.<br>
Just relax, enjoy, and do it your own way.<br>
Fritz Rumey：<br>
As her expression softens a tad, a faint tremble runs through her eyes.<br>
Are you saying the rules don't matter that much and I should try to just enjoy this?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
Yeah. Forget about the rules for now. Just keep things as they are and relish the moment.<br>
Fritz Rumey：<br>
She mulls it over for a moment, then breathes a deep sigh.<br>
Fine. I'll consider your feedback in earnest.<br>
In the meantime, however...<br>
What am I supposed to do? I'm no expert at "relishing the moment."<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Smile, I guess?</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：Let loose and do what you want!</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Let's see a smile first? You don't have to look so stern.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fritz Rumey：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Very well... I'll try.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Her lips curve into a somewhat forced smile. It seems a bit awkward but in a cute way.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''No need to think too much, just let yourself loose and do what you want!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fritz Rumey：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''I can do whatever I want?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''I was joking. Sorry if that wasn't clear.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
Ultimately, my feedback is just my opinion. It's up to you in the end.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fritz Rumey：</span><br>
Up to me, you say?<br>
She lowers her gaze slightly, and a touch of red colors her usually dignified face.<br>
She assumes a less on-edge posture and relaxes her hands. She softly touches my hand with her pinky finger.<br>
A moment of trembling hesitation passes for her, then she locks her fingers with mine.<br>
Then can I... forget about all the rules and just be with you for now?<br>

<br>
I head to the elevator corridor after getting a call from Z52. Just as I arrive, I see her leaping out.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z52：</span><br>
In one hand, she holds her smartphone – with the other, she pulls up a slipping leg of her tights.<br>
Okay, I just exited the eleva—<br>
Oh! You came to meet me!<br>
She hangs up the line and waves at me with a lively smile on her face.<br>
Without her hand holding it up, her tights start to slide again.<br>
Oh, shoot!<br>
Uh, gimme a minute! I'm just gonna put on some anti-slipping tape...<br>
Wait, where'd I put it? I arrived late specifically 'cause I bought it, so where is it?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
Need a hand there?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z52：</span><br>
No, no, I'm fine! I'm already keeping you waiting, and that's bad enough!<br>
These tights are a lot looser than I expected... I should've tried them on before I went out!<br>
They've been trying to slide off my leg ever since I put them on, and the wind was howling when I ran here...<br>
She starts recounting everything that happened up to now and stops looking for her tape.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：(Tell her to save the story for later.)</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：(Offer to hold her bag.)</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Easy there, speedster. You can tell me all about it after you find that tape to hold up your tights.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z52：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Oh, right! I just found it!<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Let me just put this on here...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''I'll hold your bag for you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Want me to hold your bag? Since you have your hands full.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''We can talk after you've found the tape and secured your tights.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z52：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Just found it! But since you're offering to hold the bag...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z52：</span><br>
Thanks!<br>
After handing her bag to me, she applies the tape and adjusts her clothes.<br>
They were hanging loosely around her before, and now they fit perfectly.<br>
There!<br>
With a skip and a hop, she makes sure that the tights won't affect her mobility, then she gives me a smile.<br>
Everything's in order now! Let's head inside the shop!<br>
I've gotta make up for being so late!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
Right. Oh, by the way, I ordered a cake and some drinks.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z52：</span><br>
Sweet! Come on, let's dash!<br>
She grabs my hand and breaks into a sprint.<br>
The shop's over here, right?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
No, it's over THAT way.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z52：</span><br>
What?! You're kidding!<br>

<br>
*knock knock*<br>
I knock on the door of the room where Duisburg is waiting.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Duisburg：</span><br>
Commander? You're here awfully early... Ah, did you want to see me that badly? Heehee.<br>
...<br>
W-wait... What's THIS?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
What's what?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Duisburg：</span><br>
Hearing her panic, I open the door without a second thought and step inside.<br>
Commander?! Why'd you barge in just like that?<br>
Somewhat awkwardly kneeling on the couch, she hurriedly lowers her gaze as soon as she sees me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
You okay? What happened?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Duisburg：</span><br>
Nothing at all. I just... dropped a cup of water.<br>
There is no cup nor water stain anywhere on the floor as far as I can see.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
(Alright then... I just pretend that's all it was.)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Duisburg：</span><br>
It's no big deal. Anyway, let's cut to the chase, shall we?<br>
Since you're here early, why don't we start our secret training right away?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
First, I have a question – what's this training actually about?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Duisburg：</span><br>
Well... It involves providing service to you, as my master.<br>
Remember, it would be my first time at this pop-up shop, and I'm not sure I'm cut out for it.<br>
If I get used to being around you ahead of time, maybe I'll handle it better in the shop.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
Ahh. I get it now.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Duisburg：</span><br>
...<br>
She takes a deep breath, but it doesn't look like it helps calm her down.<br>
W-welcome back, Master... How can I serve you today?<br>
Her typical confidence is all gone – her crossed arms are a sign of nervousness, as are her restless hands.<br>
A soft blush spreads across her cheeks, even coloring her ears pink.<br>
Th-this isn't working... I can't do it in these clothes!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
(The clothes are the problem? Now that she mentions it, what Duisburg is wearing indeed doesn't look like the pop-up shop's attire...)<br>
(Wait a second...)<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：(Did she get the wrong clothes?)</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
You're wearing the wrong clothes, aren't you? I don't think that's pop-up shop standard issue.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Duisburg：</span><br>
I should've known there would be no hiding it...<br>
Yes, you're right! These clothes are for a different occasion!<br>
They were in a box that looked so similar to the shop one, and I picked the wrong one.<br>
Even if it's just the two of us... it's still embarrassing to wear something like this... I mean, look at me!<br>
She averts her gaze to avoid meeting mine.<br>
And there's no mirror in this room either, so I can't even tell if I put it on right.<br>
I don't want you to see me in something that looks so off...<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：But you look great in it.</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：It looks cute on you.</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Not only great, but very cute as well.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''There's no reason for you to feel nervous about it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Super cute, in fact.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Duisburg：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Do you mean it?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''I mean it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
If it really bothers you, let's call off the training and get you into your regular clothes first.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Duisburg：</span><br>
No, it's fine. I'm relieved after what you just said.<br>
I don't feel so anxious now.<br>
Oh, right, the training...<br>
She pauses to think momentarily, then shakes her head to herself.<br>
As her nervousness fades, she finally relaxes her tightly crossed arms.<br>
Assuming you're not opposed to this, Master...<br>
She inches closer to me, her figure bathed in the warm, inviting light, making her look exceptionally enchanting.<br>
Please allow me to serve you in this attire. ♥<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Formidable：</span><br>
Mmgh... Finally got the scissors! Ugh... Can't reach... Huh?<br>
C-Commander?! Why are you here already?! You're not supposed to be here this soon!<br>
I'm met with a shocking sight immediately upon entering Formidable's so-called secret base.<br>
Her one leg is held high by a ribbon, and she's struggling to stay upright on the bed.<br>
She squirms about, holding a pair of scissors in her hand.<br>
L-look away! And please close the door!<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：(Stay.)</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：(Leave.)</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Formidable：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''As a compromise, I close the door behind me but remain in the room.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''What are you doing?! Come any closer only at your own risk, do you hear?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Ahahaha... I'm here to help you. Can I borrow your scissors? Wriggling like this might hurt you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Formidable：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Pardon? Do you just want to help?<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Very well... Here. Now please cut me loose.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''(I wouldn't want to be seen like this either if I were her. I'll just get out and leave her alone.)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Formidable：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''I turn around and step outside. Then, just as I'm about to close the door...<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''E-excuse me? Commander, where are you going?<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''I'd like it if you came to my assistance here! If you walk out now, don't expect me to listen to you again!<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''As a compromise, I close the door behind me but remain in the room.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''How could you think of abandoning me like that? Be a kind soul and help cut me loose!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Formidable：</span><br>
I take the scissors from her then gently hold her suspended leg.<br>
Her skin feels hot to the touch. She must be feeling rather embarrassed.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
Alright, try to relax. If you move suddenly, you might get hurt while I cut the ribbon.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Formidable：</span><br>
"Try to relax"... That's easy for you to say!<br>
Despite her objection, she does relax her leg.<br>
C-Commander... Come a little closer...<br>
Do me a favour and support my leg, please. I'll get a cramp holding it like this otherwise.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
Sure thing.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Formidable：</span><br>
I draw one step closer and kneel, letting her rest her leg on my shoulder.<br>
I can clearly hear her flustered breaths now that I'm this close.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
I'm going to cut it now. Hold still.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Formidable：</span><br>
Carefully snipping the ribbon that bound her, I support her ankle and gently lower her leg.<br>
Thank you kindly...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
What?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Formidable：</span><br>
I'm embarrassed as it is – I'd prefer not to repeat myself!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
Fair, fair... How did you end up like this, anyway?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Formidable：</span><br>
...<br>
*sigh*... Well, you did help me, so I shall tell you what happened.<br>
You see, I'd just got done decorating the room a bit, then I was in the mood for a solo performance. I got caught on a ribbon, and, well...<br>
This is too embarrassing to continue! You can't tell anyone about this! Erase what you just saw and heard from your memory!<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Don't worry, I won't.</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：How could I possibly forget this adorable side of you?</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''I'll take this with me to the grave.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Formidable：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Truly? Do you promise?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Not to tell anyone? Yes. Erasing this from my memory, though, that's a tall order...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Formidable：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Come again? Surely you can at least TRY to forget it!<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''You have far better things to dedicate to memory, no?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Formidable：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''I tease her for the heck of it. Her face turns red, if only for a moment.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''I-it's terribly embarrassing, you know! I implore you not to say anything like that again!<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''But... I suppose I could allow you to remember how adorable I looked. Nothing beyond that, however!<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Instead, you should commit THIS to memory!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Formidable：</span><br>
She gracefully picks up the nearby guitar and holds it in a cool pose.<br>
Never mind that little mishap... It's time for a one-on-one concert!<br>
Eyes on me, Commander! ♪<br>

<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
...Bismarck?<br>
<br>
The room should be empty, save for a load of presents from the girls. Should be.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck：</span><br>
Commander...?<br>
<br>
Yet, there is Bismarck, flustered and dressed in a festive Christmas outfit.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I, uh, came here to open my presents. Are you still getting yours ready? Should I wait outside?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck：</span><br>
No, no need...<br>
This is my fault for forgetting to tell you ahead of time. Apologies.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Oookay...<br>
(That's not like her. She would never "forget to tell me" anything.)<br>
(Maybe she tried to sneak in to leave her gift. If so, I might have ruined the surprise...)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck：</span><br>
You're thinking that my surprise has been spoiled, aren't you?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
You read my mind.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck：</span><br>
Ahaha. It's in fact what I was thinking, too.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Sorry. I imagine you worked hard on my present.<br>
Tell you what, how about you give it to me directly?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck：</span><br>
Give you... "it"?<br>
<br>
The word "it" makes her pause. Her cheeks turn red, and she hesitates to continue, casting an uncharacteristically shy and uncertain glance at me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck：</span><br>
Well, I AM your present, you see...<br>
<br>
Following her downcast gaze, I realize she's sitting on a sheet of wrapping paper.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
You mean... you're giving yourself to me?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck：</span><br>
Ahem... Per Eugen's suggestion.<br>
She said, "If you're bad at expressing your feelings with words, do it with actions instead." I simply did what she suggested.<br>
<br>
She shyly hangs her head, looking a little fidgety.<br>
Pushing the glass of wine on the floor further away from her, she again meets my gaze.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck：</span><br>
It's my first time doing something like this... I thought a drink might help me feel more at ease.<br>
I suppose it didn't work...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
No, it did.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck：</span><br>
Hm?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
The surprise might have been spoiled by my sudden appearance, but it turned out great in the end.<br>
Besides, it's the thought that counts, right? Thank you.<br>
Being able to spend this holiday together with you is already a fantastic gift.<br>
<br>
Her eyes light up, and a joyous, gentle smile appears on her lips.<br>
She leans in closer to me in her festive outfit.<br>
The fireworks bursting outside can't hold a candle to the sparkle in her eyes.<br>
Her warm breath graces my ear...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck：</span><br>
Merry Christmas, Commander.<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ägir：</span><br>
Oh, Commander, put on a record that sets the mood.<br>
No sooner than I set foot inside the room does Ägir issue an order to me from her single sofa.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
You got it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ägir：</span><br>
I pick a record and spin it on the phonograph, then head to the coffeemaker.<br>

(I've got work after this, so a cuppa joe would do me good.)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ägir：</span><br>
After the coffee finishes brewing, Ägir exclaims another order before I can even ask.<br>
Extra sugar. I can't drink it otherwise.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
Yes, ma'am.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ägir：</span><br>
I add a hefty spoonful to the coffee and place the cup on the table beside her.<br>
Commander.<br>
She speaks yet again, stretching her legs out toward me.<br>
She haphazardly flings her shoes off and teasingly pokes my knee with her toes.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
What is it?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ägir：</span><br>
Nothing. It just struck me how you know your place today.<br>
Have you finally bowed to my power as the god of the sea?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
Uhh...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ägir：</span><br>
Disappointed by my response, she lifts her foot higher and runs her toes along my thigh, moving further up.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：(Grab her ankle.)</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：(Make her stop.)</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ägir：</span><br>
I seize her foot by the ankle to stop her from going any further.<br>
Huh?!<br>
Hey! Let go!<br>
She starts kicking around and tries to pull her leg back.<br>
That's enough already! Stop it! ...Eek!<br>
In a bout of sudden guilt, I let go of her foot.<br>
Taken by surprise, a look of shock and embarrassment appears on her face.<br>
She tries to play it cool, taking a sip of her coffee before she speaks again.<br>
Isn't it tiring, standing like that? Take a seat!<br>
There's room right over here! Look!<br>
She pats the small clear space next to her.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Don't mind if I do.</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：I don't think there's room for two.</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''It's a single sofa. It'll be pretty cramped if I sit on it at the same time.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''So, you know...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ägir：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''I don't have an issue with that, so why should you?<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Stop dragging your feet already and come here!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ägir：</span><br>
I take her up on her offer and sit down beside her. She quickly blushes and averts her gaze.<br>
Even though she made more room, we are literally rubbing shoulders with how cramped it is.<br>
Bah, forget it! You've been toiling away for my sake, so you can have the sofa!<br>
She rises to her feet with such haste that she loses her balance.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
Careful!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ägir：</span><br>
She falls right onto me, her soft and warm body landing in my arms.<br>
The god of the sea's hair brushes against my nose. It gives off a faint fragrance.<br>
Whuh?!<br>
After fidgeting for a moment, she finally gives up and relaxes her body, leaning gently against me.<br>
Just this once... you hear?<br>
