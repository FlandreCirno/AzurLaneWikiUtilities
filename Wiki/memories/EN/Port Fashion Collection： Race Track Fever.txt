<br>
The circuit is abuzz with excitement. Engines roar while the sound of whooshing wind rings clear.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">New Jersey：</span><br>
As I'm on my way to my race car, I'm suddenly stopped by New Jersey's warm laughter.<br>
You're finally here, honey!<br>
She sits on the edge of the open trunk of a car, dangling her slender legs off of it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
New Jersey? Why are you in the pit stop?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">New Jersey：</span><br>
Heh! What do you think? To cheer you on, honey!<br>
We've got time before your race starts, so come over here!<br>
This spot is just heavenly. Really lets you take in the excitement in the circuit.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
You always manage to find the comfiest places.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">New Jersey：</span><br>
It's a skill of mine! The mood in this place is even hotter than the weather!<br>
What about you, honey? You feeling tense?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Not at all.</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：A bit.</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''With you cheering me on, I've got no reason to feel tense and every reason to win.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">New Jersey：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''She gently hops off the trunk. The sunlight glimmers off her hair.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Okay, then I wanna see you not just win, but win with style!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Can't deny it. It's kind of getting to me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">New Jersey：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''She gently hops off the trunk. The sunlight glimmers off her hair.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''You can't go getting nervous now, or it'll affect you on the track!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">New Jersey：</span><br>
So, your personal cheerleader is gonna give you a little something to help!<br>
Before I can say anything, she stands on tiptoes and grabs my cheeks with both hands.<br>
Close your eyes, honey. The Black Dragon's got a blessing for you!<br>
I shut my eyes, and then, a pair of soft, warm lips grace mine – and with them comes the sweet taste of ice cream.<br>
Heehee! Here's my sweet and blissful blessing of super speed!<br>
After a few seconds pass, she steps away and gives me a proud look.<br>
How's that? Feeling topped off now? This includes my– Whuah?!<br>
As she steps back, her heel gets caught in a hole in the ground.<br>
I try to catch her by wrapping my arms around her waist, only for us both to fall into the trunk.<br>
Wow, honey...<br>
Talk about launching a sneak attack!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
As if you didn't launch one first.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">New Jersey：</span><br>
That was no attack! That was basically a good-luck blessing!<br>
Ooh, I think I like this mood... Gets my heart racing♪<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
What mood?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">New Jersey：</span><br>
In response to this, she closes her eyes and brings her head up to me. Her lips hover under mine, and she whispers softly to me.<br>
This. This mood...<br>
Now, come on – give me a kiss as a promise of victory, honey.<br>
As we feel our breath on each other's faces, an announcement plays. She gently grabs my shoulder, a red dash of shyness still on her cheeks.<br>
Good luck out there, my champion! Show 'em who's boss, honey!<br>

<br>
I stop my car and open the door to thunderous applause and cheering.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Admiral Nakhimov：</span><br>
On my way to the winners' podium, the first thing I see is a fine girl glowing in the sunlight.<br>
Congratulations, Commander. You never disappoint.<br>
Did you hear me cheering for you over the engines?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
Yeah. It was wonderful, as were the modifications you did to my car. The corners and straight lines were both smooth.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Admiral Nakhimov：</span><br>
Oh. I'm really glad to hear you say that.<br>
Ah, right, we need to do your award ceremony...<br>
She takes the trophy, hands it to me, and then produces a bottle of champagne.<br>
You've got to open a bottle after such an intense race. Ready, Commander?<br>
Raise your trophy, and I'll pop the champagne!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
Alright, just be careful.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Admiral Nakhimov：</span><br>
R-right. I've got it. Raise your trophy!<br>
She brims with confidence as she shakes the bottle, until suddenly, there is a pop.<br>
The cork flies out like a bullet, and the champagne gushes out like water from a fountain.<br>
Eek! Um... Meow?<br>
Seemingly unconsciously, she licks up the sweet-smelling liquid that hit her lips. She then looks at me with a gaze that gradually turns blurrier.<br>
Smells nice... Odd – you smell pretty nice too, meow...<br>
W-wait, no! Step back, Commander! You don't want to get it on yourself, too!<br>
Uh-oh... Resistance check failed... You smell really, really good, Commander...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
You okay there, Nakhimov?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Admiral Nakhimov：</span><br>
After closely observing her, it dawns on me that it was pointless to ask.<br>
Now she spontaneously rubs her cheek against my neck, and even coils her tail-like cable around my leg.<br>
Ugh... Even I'm not sure why this is happening. I just...<br>
Have to get close to you... Meow...<br>
She looks up at me, her voice growing fainter. The cable wrapping around our bodies gets tighter and tighter.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
...Where'd you get this alcohol from?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Admiral Nakhimov：</span><br>
Oh, um... From next to the podium...<br>
Do you like how it smells?<br>
Mmh... Heehee... I suddenly don't feel tired at all anymore, meow...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
You must've really worked hard today.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Admiral Nakhimov：</span><br>
Yeah... I had to do both maintenance and cheerleading work, so I guess so...<br>
The special ingredients in the alcohol do affect my working efficiency, but...<br>
Sometimes, maybe that's okay, you know?<br>
I'm glad I get to spend this much time with you, meow...<br>
Amid the warm glow, she softly wraps a cable around my finger.<br>
I'll... come up with a more perfect plan for your next race...<br>
Also... I'll get a more proper victory drink next time...<br>
But right now, I just want to share in the joy of your victory with you... Meow...<br>

<br>
Pushing open the fence in front of the maintenance area, I step onto the sunbaked ground. The smells of engine oil and rubber fill the air.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Essex：</span><br>
Essex sits down on the hood of my race car, and uses the water hose in her hand to expertly and carefully clean every nook and cranny of the car.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
It's almost time, Essex. How's your progress?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Essex：</span><br>
Don't worry about that, Commander. I'm just about finished.<br>
Your car has been roasting in the sun. We need to cool it down somehow.<br>
Driving it while it's still this hot would negatively affect its performance.<br>
There is a tinge of red on her cheeks, and beads of sweat drip down her hair and land on the hood.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
Good point, actually.<br>
I'd say you need to cool off more than my car right now, though.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Essex：</span><br>
Saying that, I pull out a cold towel from the cooler and offer it to her.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
Gotta bring your temp down, too.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Essex：</span><br>
She takes the towel and presses it against her cheek. Her expression lightens up.<br>
Rest assured, I can handle a little heat. I want your car to run at its peak performance!<br>
Besides, if it's cooling off we're talking about...<br>
Her lips curve into a mischievous smile. She grips the hose again, and starts adjusting the water pressure.<br>
Then I know a better way!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
Oh boy...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Essex：</span><br>
She points the nozzle at me, and flashes a beaming smile.<br>
Let's both cool off a little!<br>
Contrary to her expectations, however, no water shoots out. She cocks her head in confusion, looks at the nozzle, and hits it.<br>
Huh? It was working just a second ago...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
Your leg. You're sitting on the hose.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Essex：</span><br>
As I say that, I reach out and pull out the part of the hose she's sitting on before she can fully move away.<br>
Oh! Wai–<br>
SPLASH!<br>
The backed-up water comes gushing out, making her sopping wet from head to toe.<br>
Commander, I wasn't ready! Why didn't you wait for...<br>
Actually, I guess this is a blessing in disguise. It did cool me down, after all.<br>
She looks at her soaked clothes, then shoots me a glance, and suddenly seems to remember something.<br>
Right! Let's get you cooled off as well!<br>
She grabs on to my racing suit as I'm trying to back off. Faintly cold drops of water fly off of her.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
Um... Essex?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Essex：</span><br>
Heehee! Doesn't it feel much better now?<br>
She raises a drippy hand, presses her index finger to my chest, and starts to draw something.<br>
A cool sensation penetrates my clothes, sending a slight shiver through my body.<br>
There we go.<br>
Okay, take this and aim for gold, Commander!<br>
She finally lifts her head, and puts her hand away. There is an embarrassed yet elated smile on her face.<br>
The symbol she just drew on me was a heart.<br>
Good luck out there, Commander! I'll be waiting for you at the finish line!<br>
If you win, I'll tell you about what this heart really means!<br>
