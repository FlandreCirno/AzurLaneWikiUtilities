<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
Vacation season has come again! Where should we go this time?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
That's a tricky question. Our list of destinations grows smaller with each year.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
As long as there's a place to sleep, I can vacation anywhere... Zzz...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
How about something special this time? Y'know, a place where you can experience something exciting and unique!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-31：</span><br>
Scuba diving is an option. Think about it – diving into the deep sea, uncovering mysteries...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bristol：</span><br>
Did someone say MYSTERIES? Where? Tell me now!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-31：</span><br>
I was just kidding... There are no mysteries in the deep sea, only danger.<br>
Our destination's gotta be something fun but also safe for the Commander's sake.<br>
<br>
Many shipgirls have gathered in one place to earnestly discuss vacation destinations.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
Hmm... Commander, it doesn't feel like this conversation is going anywhere.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
It really isn't. Like you said earlier, though, there aren't many destinations to choose from.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pittsburgh：</span><br>
Heehee. Unable to reach a consensus on where to go on vacation, are you?<br>
<br>
Pittsburgh walks in through the office door, holding an envelope between her index and middle finger. She waves it around to get my attention.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pittsburgh：</span><br>
Go on, open it. I think it'll solve your problem just like that.<br>
<br>
She hands me the envelope, and I open it. The first thing that jumps out at me is the familiar handwriting, simultaneously neat and yet casual.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
"At this point, you're presumably all having trouble deciding where to go on vacation."<br>
"We thought you'd like something different, something new, so you are all invited to the resort town of Parisek. Signed: Indiana and Enterprise."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
A resort town, eh? I wonder where it is!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
Sounds like it has comfy beds...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Casablanca：</span><br>
Parisek... That name sounds familiar.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Have you heard it somewhere before?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nevada：</span><br>
We came up with the name ourselves. If it sounds familiar, you're probably imaginin' it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Casablanca：</span><br>
Parisek... Palisade?<br>
Actually... Never mind.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pittsburgh：</span><br>
Let's get back on topic, shall we?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
I get the idea! The resort is in the Eagle Union, so we can expect to have soda, popcorn, and burgers hand-fed to us by robots!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pittsburgh：</span><br>
Err... No. As I was saying... You all liked that Sakuran hot spring resort, right? Well, there was the drama with the Youkai Troupe, but let's ignore that.<br>
Ever since then, we've been planning an opportunity for you to experience some good ol' Eagle Union culture.<br>
So we set up this resort town in secret, and now it's finally time to tell you all about it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Ooh! So we're DEFINITELY talking about a place with robots that'll hand-feed us soda, popcorn, and burgers!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">An Shan：</span><br>
Give it a rest, Fu Shun!<br>
Reinforcing stereotypes is very rude, whether or not they have any basis in reality!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
You said, "good old" Eagle Union culture. Are we talking about the Wild West?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pittsburgh：</span><br>
Ding-ding-ding. That's correct.<br>
Just like how the Sakura Empire is synonymous with hot springs, the Eagle Union is synonymous with the Wild West.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Téméraire：</span><br>
Ooh. Are we gonna get to see a real frontier town?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Liverpool：</span><br>
Brilliant! I'm gonna take SO many photos!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nevada：</span><br>
We've got Fargo to thank for mostly takin' care of the logistics. Without her, I doubt we'd have finished on schedule!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fargo：</span><br>
It is my mission and sincere desire to provide my clients with only the finest service.<br>
<br>
At the first sign of praise, Fargo takes out a business card and presents it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fargo：</span><br>
We're a new company, and I'm currently the owner and the sole employee. Still, please do consider becoming our business partner in the future.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
So your logistics company only just became incorporated, nya. Nyahaha... You should consider signing a long-term contract with me, nya.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Owari：</span><br>
Dammit, she got the first word in again! Fargo, I just wanna ask if you'd consider doin' delivery for seasonal fruits and veggies!<br>
<br>
The next moment, Fargo is surrounded by potential business partners.<br>
While I hope they can work out some sort of deal, I have more pertinent matters to talk about.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
So, how exactly do we get to this resort town?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nevada：</span><br>
Don't you worry 'bout that. Enterprise has reserved a plane that can come pick us up as early as tomorrow!<br>
If you're raring to go, I suggest you start packin'!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bristol：</span><br>
Yippee! I can't wait to see the western prairies, feel the cool winds... and explore mysterious gold mines and cursed estates!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pittsburgh：</span><br>
Heehee. Also, I'm going to be your tour guide this time.<br>
<br>
Pittsburgh comes closer to me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pittsburgh：</span><br>
I promise you it's gonna be an unforgettable adventure♪<br>
<br>
I accept the invitation, and the girls all start beaming with excitement at the idea of visiting a frontier town.<br>
Filled with anticipation, they return to their rooms and start packing their belongings.<br>
The following morning, we all board the plane together with Pittsburgh.<br>
Sometime later...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
So tired... I was so excited I barely got any sleep last night...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ayanami：</span><br>
Yes, but we're almost there. It's starting to look like the Wild West down there.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
You're right! I can already picture it. Wooden buildings, a saloon, and cowgirls! Soon!<br>
<br>
The girls chat about the upcoming adventure while the plane slowly descends.<br>
Once the door opens, however, the only thing we're greeted by is an endless, barren prairie.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Hey, where's the town? I don't see a dang thing!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pittsburgh：</span><br>
Oops... I, uh, might have had too much juice yesterday and I forgot to tell you...<br>
We wanted you to get the full Wild West experience, which means finding an unsettled stretch of land to colonize before the vacation can truly begin.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Malin：</span><br>
So you mean WE have to colonize it?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z43：</span><br>
You withheld information just so you could exploit us for free labor!<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Now we're talkin'!</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：(Stare silently at Pittsburgh.)</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Épée：</span><br>
I-it's okay... I'll work twice as hard for you, Commander...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fleuret：</span><br>
Come on, it's obvious she was joking. You're all so easily duped!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pittsburgh：</span><br>
Heehee. Yes, sorry if I upset anyone. In reality, this place is just a temporary airfield.<br>
The actual town is a short train ride away. Come with me.<br>
<br>
Following Pittsburgh's lead, we walk to the train tracks and board the resort express.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pittsburgh：</span><br>
Get ready, because the real vacation is about to start.<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=Suddenly, Gunshots|选项=2|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<br>
Aboard the express...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fargo：</span><br>
Readings indicate that everyone's collective happiness index is 67.11% higher than usual.<br>
I suppose the act of going on vacation has that effect on you.<br>
If I want to blend in, I should raise my own happiness index accordingly.<br>
At the same time, I'll also increase my pleasure index by an appropriate 23.64%.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alsace：</span><br>
No, no, Fargo, you're doing it all wrong!<br>
This one has ample vacation experience. You can use that for reference instead!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gascogne：</span><br>
Adjusting values does not equate with true understanding of emotions.<br>
Analysis: You must study emotions just as I did.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Admiral Nakhimov：</span><br>
If you want to go about it more efficiently, I think I can help you with that.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alsace：</span><br>
By overwriting her emotional understanding with a program? Hardly an ideal solution.<br>
No, Fargo, what you should do is study this one's emotion module. It is handy... even if it overheats easily.<br>
<br>
I gaze out the window at the Wild West scenery passing by while overhearing the girls chattering merrily amongst themselves.<br>
Some others, though, aren't in such a merry mood.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dupleix：</span><br>
Uggghhh... It makes me SO anxious when I remember that my workload is gonna INCREASE during this vacation...<br>
But at the same time, if I don't take my work with me, I'll never get to enjoy some time with the Commander...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
I can empathize to a painful degree. Still, you should just focus on enjoying the present.<br>
Trust me – the last thing you should do is let work spoil your vacation!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dupleix：</span><br>
Yeah... You're right.<br>
I can do overtime or all-nighters for weeks once I'm back at the port! Vacations are for relaxing!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Attagirl!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pittsburgh：</span><br>
Hey, folks, we're almost there now.<br>
<br>
Pittsburgh strolls down the train corridor and announces that we'll be arriving shortly.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Painlevé：</span><br>
Already? It feels like we only boarded a minute ago.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pittsburgh：</span><br>
This is a short-distance express train, so yeah.<br>
The reason why we boarded a train to begin with was so you could soak in the western mood for a while first.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Ah. It's no wonder the train was dressed in period-appropriate furnishings inside and out.<br>
It even has that classic steam whistle...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pittsburgh：</span><br>
Exactly. If you're gonna call something a Wild West vacation, you've got to go all out to make everything match the theme.<br>
Hey, is that why you've been sitting here all by yourself? Because you were taking in all the details?<br>
If so, I've got something way more interesting for you to look at.<br>
<br>
With a cheeky smile, Pittsburgh takes the empty seat next to me. I immediately pick up a sweet, fruity smell coming from her.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Is that juice I smell?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pittsburgh：</span><br>
Oopsies, I gave it away! Don't tell Indiana and Enterprise or they'll fry my bacon, okay?<br>
<br>
FWEEE! FWEEE!<br>
Before I can say anything else, the train's steam whistle cuts me off.<br>
I look out the window again. At the end of the black train tracks bisecting the wilderness, I see the outline of a small town sticking out in the night.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Looks like we'll be there any minute now.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pittsburgh：</span><br>
Yeah, but–<br>
<br>
BANG!<br>
BANG! BANG! POW!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Was that... gunshots?)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:416}：</span><br>
We're settling this right here, right now! Only one gang gets to rule this town, buddy!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Herring：</span><br>
Who went and made them the rules? Screw that, let's team up and squeeze the townsfolk dry instead!<br>
<br>
Two riders on horseback gallop by outside the window.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:416}：</span><br>
Hey, that's not a bad idea...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Herring：</span><br>
You, the Commander! Fork over your valuables now! Or else...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(This has got to be some kind of farce. No matter – I'll play along for now.)<br>
Or else... what?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Herring：</span><br>
Or else you're getting a li'l present from me! Mwah!<br>
<br>
The moment she blows me a kiss, the train starts to shake violently.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
What was that? Did you plant bombs on the train?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Herring：</span><br>
Hahaha! Who doesn't love a good explosion, right?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:416}：</span><br>
Hurry up! Leave your valuables behind then get off the train!<br>
<br>
Doing as told, I leave my baggage on the train, after which Herring escorts us to the town... for some reason.<br>
We pass through the smoke and dust raised by the explosions and the gunfight, and the town finally reveals itself in full.<br>
To little surprise, we find Indiana and friends waiting for us at the town's entrance, all with warm smiles on their faces.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Herring：</span><br>
Alright, that's the end of our bit. Welcome, folks, to the frontier resort town of Parisek!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Indiana：</span><br>
Hahaha! Good that you finally made it.<br>
So, how'd you like the act? It's as Wild West as it gets, right?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Not enough thrills.</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：It was pretty good.</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''While it's not as wild as I imagined the Wild West would be, it was still a decent opener.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''I've not had such a unique welcome in a while. My hat's off to whoever came up with that.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Essex：</span><br>
Hear that, Enterprise? I told you the Commander would be okay with it!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Hm? Was this your idea, Essex?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Essex：</span><br>
It was! Heeheee. I thought we should treat you to something special after flying all the way over here.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Indiana：</span><br>
Took a lot of rehearsals and a lot of fine-tuning the direction.<br>
In the end, we settled on this comparatively gentle one.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet：</span><br>
It's just a shame that we all had our hands full when we decided to do this.<br>
We were gonna have a bigger shootout, with more people robbing the train. As it is now, it didn't hit nearly as hard as it could have.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Essex：</span><br>
It really is a shame. It would've been so cool if we could've had dozens of masked bandits riding along both sides of the train, shooting at each other.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Guam：</span><br>
That's a good idea!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Essex：</span><br>
What is?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Guam：</span><br>
What you just said! Dozens of bandits riding side-by-side, having a huge shootout!<br>
That'd be like, THE clippable scene if it were in a movie! Right, Commander?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Let me guess – inspiration has struck you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Guam：</span><br>
Exactamundo! Let me paint you a picture...<br>
Wildnerness as far as the eye can see. The main character wanders through the lonesome lands, thirsty and hungry, and that's when they set foot in a remote frontier town...<br>
Then they get caught up in the town's trouble! Exciting hijinx ensues! Something like that!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Okay... Even assuming everyone's fine with using the town as an open set, you don't have the equipment to film a movie. Also, who's going to write the script?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Guam：</span><br>
I mean, we kinda DO have the equipment. Any presenter worth their salt always brings their gear with them!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
So you brought filming equipment with you on a vacation...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Guam：</span><br>
What about it? Everyone films their vacations! I want to capture those beautiful moments in time!<br>
Anyway, as I was gonna say – Hai Tien can be the scriptwriter.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hai Tien：</span><br>
M-me? Um, I'm not particularly well-versed in this genre...<br>
I COULD write it, but I'd need some of you to review it for changes and suggestions.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Guam：</span><br>
No problemo! That's easy to arrange.<br>
So, we've got film equipment and a writer, and that's all we need. Let's make a film!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Not so fast. I want to see the schedule for the next few days first.<br>
I don't want the film-making to collide with events that the others planned.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
Don't worry about that. We only have two special events planned for you.<br>
You'll have tons of free time to explore the town at your leisure, so the filming shouldn't collide with anything.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Indiana：</span><br>
As for the events themselves, well... You'll find out more tomorrow!<br>
If anyone's worried about their luggage, don't be. U-556 already brought it all to the town inn.<br>
You're now free to explore the town at your whim. Go and enjoy yourselves!<br>

{{折叠面板|标题=The Settler Experience|选项=3|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<br>
Early in the morning, I receive a message from Yorktown to come meet her outside the town.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yorktown：</span><br>
The event we have planned for you today is – the full settler experience.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Malin：</span><br>
Ugh. I'm getting tired just from hearing those words...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">L'Audacieux：</span><br>
Don't even think about sneaking away. A Chevalier does not shy away from hard work.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pompeo Magno：</span><br>
I can broadly guess what it's about from the name alone, but what, specifically, are we going to do?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yorktown：</span><br>
We're going to settle the wilds. Or, to put it another way, make this place feel more inhabitable.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">New Jersey：</span><br>
Yup! It's about growing the settlement into a village, then from a village into a town.<br>
That should give you an idea of what to expect.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yorktown：</span><br>
Yes. That means finding food and water and creating a place to live for yourselves.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">New Jersey：</span><br>
It takes luck, manpower, and a sense for community development! All of them are important!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
In essence, you want us to build a new town from scratch, yes?<br>
Magnificent!<br>
I like the sound of that! I will make a town that serves as a beacon for Sardegna's glory!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">New Jersey：</span><br>
Uhh... Sure? This is just to give you a taste of what it was like, though, so a small wooden hut will do just fine.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yorktown：</span><br>
While there are plenty of materials to build with, you will need some carpentry skills.<br>
Don't worry – we have prepared tools for you to work with.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Clemenceau：</span><br>
Isn't there more to it than this? This feels a little easy for a first-settler experience.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">New Jersey：</span><br>
Because there's more! You'll need to design and build your shelter as well as find food and water, and there's a time limit on all of them.<br>
You need to secure all the essentials you need to survive, and you only have so much time to do so.<br>
Only those who've obtained it all by the end can call themselves true pioneers!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Whoa, whoa, this is getting really hard really fast.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Herring：</span><br>
If it gets too hard, ya can always skip looking for food.<br>
I've got plenty of canned stuff to go around!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Clemenceau：</span><br>
It's the dreaded canned herring, isn't it?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Anchorage：</span><br>
Dred-dead... I don't know that word, but I wanna try it!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Herring：</span><br>
I'm just saying – if ya wanna lower the difficulty, come to me to get your can of food.<br>
Being a settler wasn't easy, and your options are limited!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Clemenceau：</span><br>
Fair enough... I'll keep it in mind as a last resort.<br>
One thing is clear to me now. Failing to finish your hut within the time limit will also leave you with less time to find water and food.<br>
Thus, your only option if you don't want to starve is to eat canned herring.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Sounds a lot like a punishment to me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Clemenceau：</span><br>
I'm only trying to motivate the rest of you. You should do like THEM and start designing your huts.<br>
<br>
Clemenceau points toward two shipgirls, pen and paper in hand.<br>
It's Dupleix and Strasbourg, frantically sketching up blueprints.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Strasbourg：</span><br>
No way in hell! I'd sooner die than eat canned herring!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dupleix：</span><br>
Well said! I fear no overtime – but that stuff? It scares me!<br>
<br>
Seeing them work springs the rest of the girls into designing their own huts.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Clemenceau：</span><br>
Heehee. THIS is how an event should be.<br>
Good luck to you, Commander.<br>
Well, personally, I would love to feed you some canned herring, but still.<br>
<br>
Clemenceau smiles at me, then takes a sheet of paper and starts drawing.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(I'd better get to it...)<br>
<br>
Sometime later...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
Uh, Laffey, why have you only drawn a single triangle?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
Because some planks glued together are good enough for me.<br>
As long as I can get inside and sleep, that's all I need... Zzz...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Implacable：</span><br>
Hmm... Perhaps I should convert the confessional into a prayer room.<br>
Then again, a confessional leads to much more fun scenarios. Heehee.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
This narrow plot of land isn't nearly big enough to demonstrate my creativity!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
It really isn't! How do they expect me to be content with some shabby shack?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">New Jersey：</span><br>
Sounds like you're all having fun, and we're still only in the design stage!<br>
<br>
New Jersey looks around at the girls, then walks up to me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">New Jersey：</span><br>
What've you sketched up, honey? Can I see?<br>
<br>
I give her my blueprint.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">New Jersey：</span><br>
Hang on... Isn't this layout just like your office?<br>
Don't tell me you're STILL in work mode. Are you not enjoying the vacay?<br>
<br>
She shoots me a concerned look.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
No, it's just that that's the only idea that came to mind as far as designs go.<br>
Look at it this way – you all come through my office at some point, right? That makes it a starting point, in a sense.<br>
So, without thinking about it, I just copied my office layout.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Poltava：</span><br>
Heehee. That sounds almost like cheating.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Now that you mention it... Royal Maids, help my servant build that Wild West office!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Belfast：</span><br>
As you wish, Your Majesty.<br>
<br>
With a lot of extra help, my wooden frontier office is now complete.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Clemenceau：</span><br>
Not bad. Not bad at all. However, we spent so long building it that we couldn't find any food or water...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Herring：</span><br>
You know what that means! Caaanned herring!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Wait! Let me try one last thing first!<br>
<br>
Fu Shun picks up bits of wood scattered on the ground and makes a stack of them.<br>
She constructs a very modest throne, then takes a seat on it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Upon the altar of the justiciar shall I sit; toward the heavens and the seven stars shall I raise my sword!<br>
Well, I don't have a sword, but still.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
What are you doing?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
What does it look like? I'm trying to borrow divine powers! Have you heard of the Empery expression, "borrow the east wind"? You can borrow food in the same way!<br>
Let there be wind! Let there be rain! Let there be food!<br>
...Hello?<br>
<br>
Crickets. No wind blew, no rain fell, and no food appeared from thin air.<br>
The tumbleweeds, however, heard her call and hit her directly.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Herring：</span><br>
C'mon, just accept the fact you'll be eating herring.<br>
<br>
Herring goes around and gives everyone a can of herring.<br>
We all gather on the floor of my frontier office and dig into our very modest meals.<br>
With my breath held, I open the can and find not herring inside, but rather ordinary combat rations.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Huh? Did you replace the contents of these cans with regular rations?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Herring：</span><br>
Heh, I sure did, since nobody else appreciates the greatness of canned herring.<br>
It was worth it to see the looks on your faces.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Hey! How come MINE has actual herring in it?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Herring：</span><br>
Oops, I forgot to mention some of them really are the real deal.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yorktown：</span><br>
Ahahaha... Well, this isn't exactly what I expected...<br>
But it did leave us with an unforgettable memory, wouldn't you say, Commander?<br>
<br>
I give Yorktown a small nod, then turn my eyes on Herring, chasing Fu Shun around the office.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Unforgettable being the keyword.<br>
<br>
And so, our trial of the settler experience concludes while the scent of canned herring hangs in the air.<br>

<br>
It's the next morning. I received a message from Hornet to come meet her at the plaza.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet：</span><br>
Hah! You're actually just in time, Commander! I thought you had a rep for arriving early.<br>
I'm guessing you must've overslept because your bed was too comfy.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Impero：</span><br>
Equating being on time with oversleeping... What a terrible thing to say to someone.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet：</span><br>
Anyway, let's move on!<br>
The event we have planned for you today iiis... gold scrounging! I've prepared some equipment to get you all started.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cleveland：</span><br>
"Equipment"... You mean pans and shovels? I asked Essex about this just yesterday.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet：</span><br>
Those are the go-to, but that's not all we have. Indiana wanted to make it a little more fun.<br>
See, if you want to look for valuables in the river, we've also got powerful magnets for you to use!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Huan Ch'ang & Kawakaze：</span><br>
Magnets?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bell：</span><br>
Yeah, it's called magnet fishing. Instead of a hook and fishing line, you use a nylon rope and a powerful magnet to pull up metallic stuff from the riverbed.<br>
Those who want to try magnet fishing, come to me to get your ropes and magnets.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet：</span><br>
And those who wanna do it the old-fashioned way, come get your shovels and pans here!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
Ooh! Magnet fishing sounds more fun than panning!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Huan Ch'ang：</span><br>
So... The magnet hooks onto anything even remotely magnetic, right?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Yeah. You're bound to catch SOMETHING. I think it's perfect for you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Huan Ch'ang：</span><br>
It is. At least I won't be going home empty-handed this way.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet：</span><br>
Pick whichever you feel suits you best!<br>
Once everyone's geared up, Bell and I will take you to the river.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Hmm... Which one...)<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：(Pick the old-school pan and shovel.)</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：(Try your hand at magnet fishing.)</span>'''''<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''If you want to experience the authentic Wild West, you've gotta stick with tradition!<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''The temptation of a guaranteed catch is hard to resist. Let's do it the new way!<br>
<br>
I take the equipment and follow the guides to a river not far from the resort town.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet：</span><br>
Y'know, it kind of dawned on me that scrounging for crumbs of metal isn't the most exciting thing...<br>
It's just menial work repeated over and over. Should we spice it up by creating two teams and see who gets the best haul?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Competing over who gets the most doesn't make the work itself any more interesting.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Richelieu：</span><br>
In that case, why don't we make the act of looking for gold more interesting?<br>
For instance, by letting everyone use whatever they have at hand to modify their tools. Within the spirit of gold-hunting, of course.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Ah. You mean allowing them to use their creativity to improve efficiency.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Richelieu：</span><br>
Exactly. That will make the work less repetitive, I believe.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
It's a good idea. Hornet, tell the others about it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet：</span><br>
On it!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Aoba：</span><br>
Testing, testing... Alright, our first-ever Wild West Gold-Hunting Competition is well underway!<br>
I'm Aoba, your on-the-scene commentator for this event!<br>
Looks like the contestants are making some solid progress out there... Oh? What have we here?<br>
It's da Vinci! She used her ingenuity and whatever was at hand to create a Fifty-Fifty Goldy Sifty Machine!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
Weird... How come there's nothing but pebbles left?<br>
Something must've gone wrong... Oh! That gives me another idea!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Aoba：</span><br>
Uh-oh! Looks like da Vinci has run into trouble with her impromptu invention!<br>
Let's go have a look at the other contestants!<br>
Over to you, Alfredo!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alfredo Oriani：</span><br>
Thanks, Aoba! Alfredo here, reporting to you live!<br>
Let's turn our attention over to the group of magnet fishers!<br>
Whoa, look at that speed! Baltimore found a spot and threw her magnet in so fast I could barely see it!<br>
Look at her expression! That look screams, "there's GOT to be good stuff down there"!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Baltimore：</span><br>
Uh, I just threw it in a random spot...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bremerton：</span><br>
Hey, over-the-top enthusiasm and exaggerations are the best part about live commentaries. Better get used to it!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Baltimore：</span><br>
Right...<br>
<br>
Aoba and Alfredo run back and forth along the river, delivering commentary as they go.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(It really is a shame Guam's been stuck in her room doing editing work for the past few days. She'd bring a whole nother level of excitement to this place.)<br>
<br>
I think idly to myself as I continue searching for valuables in the river.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Herring：</span><br>
Cut it out already! I'm only here to watch, not take part!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bell：</span><br>
Really? You seemed so excited about it earlier.<br>
And look, you've even got the equipment. I think you actually DO want to join in on the fund.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Herring：</span><br>
La la la, I can't hear you! I just happened to grab this stuff without any thought!<br>
I can't afford to work up a sweat. Not with the Commander right over there.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mogador：</span><br>
Heehee... Worried about sweating, huh? I know just the thing that would help...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Herring：</span><br>
Oh yeah? What?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mogador：</span><br>
Take off all your clothes, then it won't be that hot!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Joffre：</span><br>
Please stop being nudism's strongest soldier.<br>
Oh, and also please stop taking off your cloak when I'm not around.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mogador：</span><br>
But the thought of working up a sweat with the Commander makes me feel all hot and botheeered...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Joffre：</span><br>
That does not change the fact that it's public indecency.<br>
<br>
A while later, Hornet announces that time is up. It's time to check our total haul for the day.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-31：</span><br>
You know, I went into this knowing that anything could end up in a river...<br>
But a torpedo? How?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet：</span><br>
Don't ask me. I've got no clue.<br>
All I know is that this is a pretty good haul. Our efforts... panned out. Get it?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bell：</span><br>
Let's see, if we ignore the torpedo... A wrench... A safe... Some pebbles... A tire?<br>
Wait, did NOBODY find any gold?<br>
Did San Diego put it in the wrong place when we were setting things up?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Did she what when you were what?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet：</span><br>
Don't worry about it! A lot of gold mining ends up yielding absolutely nothing of value!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bell：</span><br>
Uh, yeah! Exactly!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet：</span><br>
Well, that's it for this event! Good work, y'all!<br>

<br>
Just as I'm about to return to my lodgings...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Indiana：</span><br>
Sup. You busy, Commander?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：(Tell her you were planning to sleep.)</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：(Tell her you're free.)</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''I was going to retire for the night, but if you need help with something, I'm all ears.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Not really. Do you need help with something?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Indiana：</span><br>
Kinda. I don't need your HELP so much as I want you to tag along.<br>
The moon looks banging tonight, and I thought I'd round up some people and we'd all gaze at it together.<br>
<br>
Indiana points to the moon.<br>
It hangs in the prairie sky, waxing. It feels like you could reach out and pluck it.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
You're right – the full moon is the best time to admire its beauty.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Indiana：</span><br>
Hahah. Sounds like you're on board, so I'll send out some texts to some people!<br>
Come along in the meanwhile. I'll show you the perfect spot for moon-gazing.<br>
<br>
Indiana leads me to an empty stretch of land.<br>
She quickly brushes up a spot on the ground then invites me to sit down with her.<br>
Usually she looks all cool and collected, but under the silvery moonlight, she almost looks like a reserved wallflower.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Indiana：</span><br>
Hey, Commander...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Yes?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Essex：</span><br>
Oh! There you two are!<br>
I've brought all the invitees! And some snacks and drinks!<br>
<br>
Before Indiana could finish her sentence, Essex interrupted her from afar.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Indiana：</span><br>
Er, I'll tell you another time!<br>
It wasn't anything important anyway. Ahem...<br>
<br>
Her eyes wander, and her tone sounds vaguely dejected.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">San Diego：</span><br>
C'mon, you two! That's enough hush-hush talk between you!<br>
Get over here and grab a snack that Essex got us!<br>
<br>
Joining the others, we start a campfire and sit down around it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
Wooow, the moon is so pretty tonight! And look at all those stars!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z43：</span><br>
Hrmh. The night sky shines brilliantly... Aha! This must be some sort of ploy by the Dark Requiem to get us to lower our guards!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
Dark Requiem? What's that?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z43：</span><br>
There, my companion! Do you see it? The brightest pair of stars in the sky – those are the eyes of the Specter Knight!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-31：</span><br>
Are you really gonna do this bit when we're just trying to enjoy the view?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z43：</span><br>
Heheheh... It's no bit. It's my identit– I mean, the truth as seen by my demon eye!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
Hahah. You have an interesting way with words.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Essex：</span><br>
Wait, are you the kind of person who buys into this nonsense?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
If it livens up the mood or if it makes you think, I can get down with it once in a while.<br>
Don't you think so, too, Commander?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：(Nod.)</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：Yeah. And that shooting star – that's a Specter Carriage!</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Essex：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Oh no, the infection is spreading...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Essex：</span><br>
Okay, and what "deep lore" does the Milky Way have?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet：</span><br>
The Milky Way? That's a space ranch!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Essex：</span><br>
That's not even on the same wavelength as what she said a minute ago.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet：</span><br>
I mean, the Milky Way is milky, so a ranch makes sense! It's about the bigger picture!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yorktown：</span><br>
Heehee. Isn't it nice, shooting the breeze with friends under the moon?<br>
I'd even go so far as to say it's romantic, in a way.<br>
<br>
The fire crackles while the girls munch on their snacks and talk about the vacation.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pittsburgh：</span><br>
We've been on this subject long enough. Change of topic – what's the most memorable thing you've done on this vacation?<br>
Oh, and nobody say, "help make a movie."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Indiana：</span><br>
What's wrong with that?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pittsburgh：</span><br>
It's what you'll all say. Let's hear something different.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Indiana：</span><br>
True. What order do we go in? From U-556 on the left and to the right? Let's do that.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-556：</span><br>
Hmm... Most memorable thing...<br>
Maybe... ride a horse? I tried really hard to look cool outside of my natural element!<br>
Did you like my acting during the train robbery scene? Wasn't it cool? Heehee!<br>
The saddle was so firm and hard, though... Next time I ride a horse, I think I'll get a soft saddle.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Herring：</span><br>
Uh, do I have to be as specific as she just was?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pittsburgh：</span><br>
You don't HAVE to be, but you DO need to give us some deets.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Herring：</span><br>
That's the annoying part...<br>
I think the most memorable thing is this! This night under the moonlight, shared with you all!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pittsburgh：</span><br>
Aww, listen to you, you big softie♪<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Herring：</span><br>
Whatever! What's YOUR most memorable moment, huh?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pittsburgh：</span><br>
Mine? I think every moment of this vacation has been unforgettable.<br>
<br>
As she says that, she leans her body against mine.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Herring：</span><br>
HEY! That's cheating! Call the ref!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pittsburgh：</span><br>
I dunno, is this cheating? I'd say it's all pretty memorable.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Herring：</span><br>
I swear...<br>
<br>
And so it goes as we talk and mess around well into the night.<br>
The moon gazing party is about to wrap up, but then someone raises their voice.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Indiana：</span><br>
Hey, how about one more memorable thing for the road, eh?<br>
<br>
Indiana unholsters the revolver at her waist, spins it around her finger, then fires two shots into the air.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Whoooa! That looks even more fun than setting off fireworks!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">L'Audacieux：</span><br>
What about those who don't have a revolver on hand?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Indiana：</span><br>
Fire your cannons instead! Just mind your fire so the Commander doesn't get hurt!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Everyone：</span><br>
Okay!<br>
<br>
The girls deploy their riggings, load dummy rounds, and point their cannons skyward.<br>
Well, some load Type 3 shells instead of dummy rounds. At any rate...<br>
They all turn to me with excitement in their eyes, awaiting my order.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：On my command!</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：Fire!</span>'''''<br>
<br>
KABOOOM!<br>
KABOOOOOOOM!<br>
The night is lit up by cannon fire amidst a symphony of thunderous booms.<br>
A little gunpowder smoke fills the air – but it's to celebrate the moment, not to make war.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Everyone：</span><br>
Let's all do this again next year, Commander! We'll get together, watch the moon, and... No, let's just enjoy whatever comes our way!<br>
<br>
Their delightful shouts echo into the Wild West sky.<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Guam：</span><br>
There you have it! Quick, what'd you all think?<br>
<br>
As soon as the premiere at the town's movie theater ends, Guam starts asking people for their thoughts on the movie.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Indiana：</span><br>
The final cut came together a lot better than I expected!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
It really did. For that last scene, was Laffey really sleeping on the set, though?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
Mhm. I thought it'd get cut out. Guess they kept it in the final release...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Guam：</span><br>
Pretty good, huh? Editing skills are just one of my many, many talents!<br>
We should totally establish a movie award show when we get back to the port!<br>
After all, there'll be no motivation to make a movie if you don't dangle an award in front of–<br>
<br>
GRUMBLE...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
Guam? Did you skip lunch?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Guam：</span><br>
Shoot... Yeah. I've been doing nothing but crunching and editing in my room, so I totally forgot to eat.<br>
How embarrassing, having my tummy grumble so loud in public... My reputation will never recover!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Indiana：</span><br>
Ahahahah. I don't reckon the Commander cares much about a little grumble.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Nope. But since you're starving, Guam, you should come have lunch with us.<br>
<br>
Sometime later...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
Whew... That should do it. Let's call the others over.<br>
Man, it's so sunny today... Are you sure you want to eat outdoors?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Indiana：</span><br>
Why not? This weather is peak Wild West! Am I right or am I right, Hornet?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet：</span><br>
You're damn right! If you want the prime Wild West experience, you've gotta keep it authentic 'til the very end!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck：</span><br>
I agree with them both.<br>
I think people will welcome this weather rather than complain about it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Richelieu：</span><br>
As do I. Just look at this kitty – it's already enjoying the sunshine.<br>
<br>
Richelieu looked at the Meowfficer in her lap.<br>
Behind her, Shimakaze is running forward with a tray in her hands.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimakaze：</span><br>
Oh no! The hamburger! I shouldn't have run so fast!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
Careful!<br>
Hold on a second. I'll help you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Harbin：</span><br>
Yeehaw! You girls go ahead and start eating without me! I've gotta bring this horse back to the stables!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
Oh dear... A little slower, please, or my hat will fly off...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Attilio Regolo：</span><br>
That looks fun. I wanna ride a horse, too!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Harbin：</span><br>
Oops, hahaha! My bad!<br>
<br>
Harbin's yelling and the clopping of her horse's hooves grow increasingly distant.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Now this is a sight for sore eyes.)<br>
<br>
I relish the warm feelings, then Guam suddenly gets up and passes by me as though she'd remembered something.<br>
She walks up to Fargo – who's sitting next to me – and whispers to her before facing me with a smile.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Guam：</span><br>
Shh. Just watch. Don't say anything.<br>
<br>
Guam puts her index finger to her lips and urges me to stay quiet.<br>
Then, one of Fargo's drones takes to the air and starts circling above us.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
What is it doing? Filming the feast?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Guam：</span><br>
Half-correct.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Only half?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Guam：</span><br>
You got the filming part right, but you haven't figured out WHY it's filming.<br>
This is one of those precious moments, and precious moments deserve to be remembered.<br>
And not just in our heads – you want to have something tangible!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pittsburgh：</span><br>
Heehee. You're right about that.<br>
Memories will fade with time, but films and pictures let us relive the moment at any time.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Guam：</span><br>
Finally, someone who sees things the way I do!<br>
Oh, right! Commander, look up and smile!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Huh?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Guam：</span><br>
I want to capture the moment you smiled with the rest of us, duh!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Well, it might look a bit forced.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Guam：</span><br>
Hmm... Alright, then I'll start filming you in your day-to-day life instead.<br>
If I were you, I'd get used to having a camera pointed at me♪<br>
There'll be other moments like this that I wanna preserve, and there'll only be more and more as time goes on!<br>

<br>
When I enter the tavern at the arranged time, I find Pittsburgh already sitting at a table.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pittsburgh：</span><br>
Heheheh. You're late, bounty hunter.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
She crosses her legs and smiles.<br>
(Hm? Isn't that a line from Act 3? She's already gotten into her role...)<br>
Not quite. The one I'm waiting for isn't here yet.<br>
<br>
I reply with my line and approach her.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pittsburgh：</span><br>
Really? In that case...<br>
How's about you and I pass the time together 'till then?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(She's improvising now?)<br>
<br>
She takes me by the sleeve and leans in.<br>
Her breath hits my neck. It feels like the room is getting hotter.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pittsburgh：</span><br>
Say, bounty hunter... Cat got your tongue? Not sure what to say or do now?<br>
<br>
She presses her prop gun's muzzle against my collar and then lowers it down to my chest.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(This is going a little far for improv... I mean, this isn't even part of the story, is it?)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pittsburgh：</span><br>
Then let me tell you... how we can kill some time♡<br>
<br>
Flushed cheeks, eyes burning with passion.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Wait a second. Is she...)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pittsburgh：</span><br>
Heehee♡ Your heart's just pounding, isn't it?<br>
Is it because the window's open, and people can look in and see us? Did that excite you?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Pittsburgh...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pittsburgh：</span><br>
Go on, I'm listening. What do you wanna do to me? I'm ready to satisfy♡<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：How much juice have you drank?</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：Consider cooling down a little...?</span>'''''<br>
<br>
I grab the barrel of her prop gun before it can touch any... inappropriate places.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pittsburgh：</span><br>
Commander, this is a rehearsal. Get into an acting mood already~<br>
<br>
She huffs unhappily.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
You're drunk, Pittsburgh.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pittsburgh：</span><br>
I'm not drunk~<br>
<br>
While we struggle over the gun, a wooden cask next to me falls over.<br>
An orange liquid spills out of it.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Is that orange juice?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pittsburgh：</span><br>
Yep~ It's too hot, so I drank a little between shoots...<br>
It's still just a rehearsal... If you're thirsty, have a drink~<br>
Oh... Did I drink it all already?<br>
<br>
She tries to look inside the cask, but as soon as she leans forward, she falls toward me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pittsburgh：</span><br>
Such sweet, refreshing orange juice... It's a shame you didn't get some~<br>
There might be a taste of it still on my lips... Wanna try?<br>
Oh my, bounty hunter... I mean, Commander. You're awfully hot...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(I think she's the one who's heating up... Not that she'd listen when she's in this state.)<br>
This won't be a very useful rehearsal at this rate. Let's get you somewhere you can rest...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pittsburgh：</span><br>
Like where? There are rooms upstairs, but...<br>
Just going back to my room and sleeping... That's boring. I'll pass on that.<br>
Except...<br>
<br>
Her crimson eyes look up at me. There's a gleam behind that glaze of intoxication.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pittsburgh：</span><br>
If you do something fun with me... I might change my mind♡<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Indiana：</span><br>
Phew! That part is finally over... I never thought filming a movie could be so exhausting.<br>
<br>
Indiana casually sits on a wooden box and heaves a big sigh.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Good work!</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
You did have to film that scene where you come down from above, after all. That takes stamina.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Indiana：</span><br>
Yeah... You're right. And we did so many takes!<br>
I'd better amp up my exercise routine. I can't be getting exhausted from something as simple as filming a movie!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
The next shoot starts tonight. Want to go home and reset a bit?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Indiana：</span><br>
About that... I think I'll wait for the prop runners to get here and help them clean up the wood debris.<br>
Yeah. The wood from the broken ceiling.<br>
If we don't keep the set clean, someone might trip and get hurt.<br>
But I can't do it all myself, so I let them know in advance.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Let me help, too.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Indiana：</span><br>
Ooh, thanks! Then let's wait for them together!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I'm surprised though, Indiana. I didn't think you the kind of person to worry about such little things.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Indiana：</span><br>
Hm? Well, YOU pay a lot more attention to me than I thought you would.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：I'm the Commander, after all.</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：Well, before I knew it, y'know...</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Indiana：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Oh. Y'know, here I thought...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Indiana：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Actually, Commander, I feel the same...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Indiana：</span><br>
Never mind!<br>
Forget I said anything! Let's get back on topic!<br>
You said I worry about little things, right?<br>
That's a habit I picked up in combat. I only win because I don't miss the details.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
So even when you use your fists to communicate, you still need to watch for openings.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Indiana：</span><br>
Well, yeah. Having the power to knock someone out in one blow is important, but you need wisdom, too.<br>
Otherwise, you'll lose someone who's an even match for you.<br>
<br>
Indiana flashes a fearless smirk.<br>
At the same time, sunlight shines through the hole in the ceiling.<br>
It lands perfectly on her.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Indiana：</span><br>
...Hm? Sun's out, huh?<br>
<br>
After looking up once, she turns back to me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Indiana：</span><br>
The sun's shining right on you, Commander... I like this vibe.<br>
You in the sun's light, the smell of drink... My mind full of pent-up feelings... Umm...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Hmm? Did you say something?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Indiana：</span><br>
*cough!* *cough!* N-nothing! Just thinking of stuff that doesn't really matter!<br>
I'll write about it and tell you later...<br>
O-oh, the prop runners just texted me saying they'll be here soon.<br>
Y'know what? Go home and rest, Commander. We'll do this.<br>
We've got that nighttime scene later. It won't be easy!<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fargo：</span><br>
I'd better clean this up...<br>
<br>
I spot a certain someone cleaning up spilled milk.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Fargo? Anything I can help you with?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fargo：</span><br>
Commander...?<br>
In this situation, I should raise my surprise index by 12.5%...<br>
Commander?! Why are YOU here?!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
...<br>
Umm, well, you didn't come back when I thought you would. I got worried.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fargo：</span><br>
I apologize for the inconvenience caused by my overtime work.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Don't worry about it.</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：I was worried about you.</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fargo：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Okay, understood.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fargo：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Okay, understood. Thank you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fargo：</span><br>
I'm recording your emotional index to sample "concern."<br>
As for your previous question, whether there's anything you can help with...<br>
I would like your help cleaning up this spilled milk.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Sure. I can do that.<br>
<br>
I take a cloth, squat down next to her, and start wiping up milk.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fargo：</span><br>
At such a time, should I smile and display my "gratitude" emotion?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Normally, yeah.<br>
<br>
Fargo smiles. It's a gentle, warm smile reminiscent of the sun itself.<br>
However, her lovely smile fades in no time.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fargo：</span><br>
Data recorded. This is a rare emotional sample.<br>
Thank you, Commander. Before I rest, I have another request...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
What is it?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fargo：</span><br>
Yesterday's overwork has left my arms sore. I can't reach the milk that splashed onto me.<br>
I need you to help wipe it off. Please?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：(Nod.)</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：I'd be happy to.</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fargo：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''I must raise my joy index by 1.2% and express my gratitude.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Big thankies, Commander!<br>
<br>
I grab a towel this time and help wipe the milk off of her.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fargo：</span><br>
Mm... Right there is...<br>
...C-Commander...<br>
<br>
It's just the two of us. Fargo's blushing – a rare sight.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
What is it?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fargo：</span><br>
My heart rate is rising, and I'm heating up in the places you're touching me...<br>
Hmm. Based on my data so far, I believe this emotion may be... embarrassment?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Do you want me to stop?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fargo：</span><br>
...<br>
No. I never said that...<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kersaint!：</span><br>
Eeeek! S-stoooop!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Is that Kersaint?!)<br>
<br>
I rush over to the source of the scream and find a temporary fence. Inside of it is...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Kersaint!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kersaint：</span><br>
C-Commander?! Aaah...!<br>
R-run away while you still can! I-if you were... Hyah?!<br>
If you were hurt... i-it would be horrendous... Pleeease, stop!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(There's no time to call for help!)<br>
Kersaint, you need to control yourself!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kersaint：</span><br>
Aah...! C-Commander!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Keep yourself balanced so you don't accidentally kick the cow!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kersaint：</span><br>
O-okay! I'll try...<br>
<br>
While she does her best to follow my instructions, the cow's rampage gradually comes to an end.<br>
Using this opportunity, I lift up the hay bale in the corner and slowly approach the cow.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kersaint：</span><br>
C-Commander! It's calming down a little... but...!<br>
Please be careful...<br>
<br>
I nod quietly in response, continue to approach, and put the hay down in front of the cow.<br>
Then, I step back and reach my hand out...<br>
After a several-minute-long confrontation, the cow finally starts eating.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kersaint：</span><br>
*pant*... *pant*... Thank you, Commander, and the Holy Iris...<br>
<br>
I walk over to its side and offer my hand to the exhausted Kersaint.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
It's okay now.<br>
Let go of the reins and slowly get off of it. Try not to startle it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kersaint：</span><br>
Okay...<br>
<br>
She takes my hand, but she's still trembling. It doesn't seem like she'll be able to get off yet.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kersaint：</span><br>
C-Commander, I'm still scared... What if I startle it and set it off again...?<br>
Aah... I never knew dealing with animals could be so difficult... I-is this another trial given to me by the Iris?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：I'm here. Don't be afraid.</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：It's okay. Take it slow, and you'll be just fine.</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kersaint：</span><br>
Okay... *siiigh*...<br>
<br>
After a big sigh, she starts to move.<br>
But as soon as she turns...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kersaint：</span><br>
I'm all... dizzy...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Kersaint!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kersaint：</span><br>
I'm so sorry, Commander... But I really can't move anymore...<br>
<br>
She slips off of the cow's back and falls into my arms.<br>
The poor girl is shaking so much from the shock. When she reaches out, she clings tightly to my clothes.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I'm glad you're not hurt. Can you stand up?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kersaint：</span><br>
Umm... Well...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
No worries. I'll carry you back to your room.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kersaint：</span><br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Painlevé：</span><br>
Commander, this way~!<br>
<br>
I turn around and see a familiar friend lying on a pool air mattress, waving at me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Painlevé：</span><br>
I was just praying that I'd get to see you, and here you are...<br>
Heehee, wishes come true quickly on lucky days.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Is today your lucky day?</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：It's my lucky day, too, you know.</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Painlevé：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Yes, it is. My fortune says that today is perfect for a date, too...<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Painlevé：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''N-nothing... I'm sorry you had to hear that...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Painlevé：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Huh? Are you saying... that you feel lucky to see me...?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Sure am. Especially since my plans changed and gave me an unexpected moment to rest.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''That's lucky, and even more so that I got to see you here.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Painlevé：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''I see...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Painlevé：</span><br>
Come to think of it, you've been busy with the filming, no?<br>
If you'd like, you could come relax in the pool with me.<br>
<br>
I step into the pool on her suggestion. The chilly water quickly overwhelms the heat.<br>
Then, I lie on the air mattress and scoot over next to her.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Painlevé：</span><br>
U-umm... Commander, could you hold this parfait for a moment?<br>
I've been so focused on you that I ended up spilling it... Eep...<br>
<br>
Holding the parfait in one hand, she tries to wipe the cream off of her chest with the other.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Sure. Clean yourself up, okay?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Painlevé：</span><br>
Thank you. Oh, and be careful you don't spill it on yourself.<br>
<br>
She hands me the parfait and focuses her attention back on her chest.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Painlevé：</span><br>
It's a little embarrassing... Oh, not that I'd ask you to look away for me...<br>
Ooh, it's a little sticky...<br>
<br>
To make it easier to get off, she scoops water out of the pool and wets the affected area.<br>
The dripping water wets her swimsuit. The thin, white fabric sticks to her skin, becoming semi-transparent.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Painlevé：</span><br>
Phew... That's better.<br>
<br>
After she sits back up, I return her parfait.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Painlevé：</span><br>
This parfait is actually my lucky item for today.<br>
<br>
Painlevé smiles bashfully and blushes.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Painlevé：</span><br>
Umm... I'd like to share my fortune with you...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
You wanna share?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Painlevé：</span><br>
Yes. Basically... What I mean to say is, I'd like to feed you...<br>
It's a little melted... but I just know you'll like it.<br>
<br>
She gives me a spoonful of it. The sweetness of strawberry and cream blesses my tongue.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Painlevé：</span><br>
H-how do you like it?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：(Compliment the taste.)</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：(Ask for another spoonful.)</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''That is tasty.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Painlevé：</span><br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Painlevé：</span><br>

I visit the pool and find Friedrich der Große in the midst of relaxation.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
What a time for us to meet, my child. Could this be fate?<br>
Or did you come specifically to find me?<br>

Lying down on a pool air mattress, she languidly stirs the water with her fingers.<br>

Eat cherries, have a drink, and relax.<br>
<br>
Red liquid ripples in her glass. On closer inspection, her golden eyes look a tiny bit hazy.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Is she tipsy, or...?)<br>
(I don't know if I want to leave her alone in the pool right now...)<br>
Umm, may I take you to your room?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
Aww. Are you worried about me? Heehee...<br>
It's okay. I'm not drunk at all.<br>
Now, the fireworks have started. Come, my child, and watch by my side.<br>
<br>
I walk over to her as directed.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
You're just standing... Are you anxious?<br>
Then have a drink. The alcohol by volume is low.<br>
<br>
Friedrich passes me a goblet. I can still see the outlines of her lips on it.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：(Disregard and drink.)</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：(Avoid the lip marks.)</span>'''''<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''I accept and take a sip from the side her lips touched.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''There are simpler ways to sate your desires, my child.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''I spin the goblet around and drink from the untouched side.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Is someone feeling shy? Heehee.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Hmm. Yeah, you're not getting drunk off of this. I saw your face was red, so I assumed...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
The sunlight is dazzling today, and the wind and sand batter me so... My skin may just be sensitive from the weather here.<br>
<br>
She sits up. The translucent black veil she's wearing gives a glimpse of her bare skin.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
You're staring... Do you want another cherry?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
...<br>
<br>
Before I can answer, she feeds me a cherry.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
Sweet, isn't it?<br>
<br>
I open my mouth and accept the refreshing sweetness.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I was just going to warn you not to catch a cold...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
Heehee. Now that you're mentioning it, I do feel a little chilly.<br>
<br>
Instead of fixing her "clothes," though, she pats the empty space next to her.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
Lie down with me. Share your warmth, my child.<br>
<br>
Fireworks burst in the sky above, reflecting gloriously in the pool below.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
Now, my child, until this summer night's end...<br>
Indulge yourself in my arms...<br>

<br>
A town once prospered in these wastes.<br>
Its tavern was always filled with the rich smell of juice, and the pineapple pizza baked by the chef was said to be sublime.<br>
They say that the town was cursed.<br>
But if you ask me, that wasn't a curse. It was a story.<br>
After all, that's where I met the legendary Commander.<br>
– Excerpt from Hornet's "Memoirs of the West: Prologue"<br>
A tumbleweed rolls by my feet, blown by the wind. The horse next to me leans close and snorts once before resuming its listless demeanor.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Are you tired?<br>
<br>
Of course, the horse doesn't answer. The only sound continues to be the howling of the wind.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">???：</span><br>
Hornet, you'll be dead in the sand by today's end.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet：</span><br>
Heh, is that so? I hope your will's up to date, Herring.<br>
I'll show you the real quick-draw champion around these parts!<br>
<br>
Two voices break the silence of the wilderness.<br>
I follow the voices. Two cowgirls are facing each other, clearly in the midst of a duel.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：(Try approaching.)</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：(Mind your own business and leave.)</span>'''''<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''One mustn't lose their sense of adventure, even in unknown lands.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Besides, I won't know if they're friend or foe until I talk to them.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Approaching two people in the middle of a duel is hardly a wise decision.<br>
<br>
I steel myself and pull the reins of my tired steed–<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet & Herring：</span><br>
Hold it right there!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Herring：</span><br>
Don't make any sudden moves~ Unless you want a hole blown through your chest!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet：</span><br>
Yeah, yeah, put those hands up~ Don't even think of reaching for your gun, either. I'm faster than you'll ever be.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(No point in fighting right now. Let's just obey orders for now.)<br>
<br>
After seeing that I've put my hands up, the two of them nod to each other and approach me.<br>
Herring reaches for my waist, takes my revolver, and hands it to Hornet.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Herring：</span><br>
Sorry, but I'd rather be safe than sorry.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I understand how you feel, but that gun and I have come a long way.<br>
After you realize I'm clearly not a threat, I'd really like it back.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">大黄蜂：</span><br>
Now settle down a moment, stranger. First, let's empty that cylinder...<br>
Hm? That's... the mark of the Van der Light Gang!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Herring：</span><br>
What? Is this person with them?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">大黄蜂：</span><br>
There's no doubt about it. The mark on the gun proves it.<br>
But the rumors say only the founder of the gang, the Commander, has a gun with that mark...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Herring：</span><br>
A-are you saying... that this is the Commander in front of us? Able to traverse the most dangerous places with just brain and brawn?<br>
The one who disappeared right after becoming a legend? THAT Commander?!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(This wasn't in the script, but I guess that was my backstory.)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Herring：</span><br>
Ahem. Hey, are you really the Commander?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Depends on who's asking.</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：Want an autograph, or something?</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Herring：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Don't bother refusing, because I won't believe it!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">大黄蜂：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''That's right! This is definitely the real deal!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Herring：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''You mean it? Okay–wait, I don't even have pen or paper!<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''We'll have to wait 'til we're back in town...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">大黄蜂：</span><br>
Hmm... What brings you around to these parts anyway, Commander?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Before I answer that, can you two tell me why you're dueling?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Herring：</span><br>
Ah, that was nothing. We just wanted to see who could draw their gun faster.<br>
Not that it matters now. Isn't that right, Hornet?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">大黄蜂：</span><br>
Heheh, yep! What's more important is... Commander, how's about you join us?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
When I started my journey, I vowed never to join another gang. I'm not interested in any more fighting.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">大黄蜂：</span><br>
Ahaha! Don't worry about that! We're not inviting you to a gang!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Herring：</span><br>
Look over there, Commander. There's a small town up ahead.<br>
<br>
She points in a direction. The silhouettes of buildings are barely visible through the dust.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Herring：</span><br>
Heheh. The stuff going on there is a hundred times more interesting than any gang war.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
What would that be?<br>
<br>
While we talk, the cloudless sky suddenly darkens.<br>
The wind roars chillingly. Sand whips up in the distance and begins closing in on the town.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">大黄蜂：</span><br>
Oh, no... Another sandstorm.<br>
They've been so common lately... Forget it. Commander, can that horse still run?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Sure can.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Herring：</span><br>
Then get on that horse, ride into town as fast as you can, and take shelter!<br>
We'll catch up with you later, Commander!<br>
<br>
The girls wave, jump onto their own horses, and ride bravely into the rising sand.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I shouldn't hesitate, either.<br>
<br>
I climb on, stroke my horse's mane, and plant my feet firmly on the stirrups.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Yah!<br>
<br>
Then, we rush toward the sand-mired town without a second thought.<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=Rabbits, Gold Mines, and Curses|选项=14|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<br>
We manage to reach town before the sandstorm can consume us.<br>
However, every door is locked, and every window is shuttered. Beneath the dark sky, it's impossible to find a hotel.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I might be better off asking a resident to shelter me for now.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：(Try the house to the left.)</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：(Try the house to the right.)</span>'''''<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Before I can knock, the door opens a crack.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''No matter how much I knock, nobody answers.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''But I can just barely hear the sound of a music box inside.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Just then, the door of the house to the left opens a crack.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">???：</span><br>
You, stranger... Come in.<br>
<br>
The house is dark, its only source of illumination being the lamp in its owner's hand.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bristol：</span><br>
Ahem... Know me as Bristol. Stranger, have you too been drawn by the allure of bounty?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Bounty?<br>
(Is this what Herring meant when she said things here were more interesting than gang wars?)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bristol：</span><br>
Your reaction tells me that you know something is happening in this town... but not what. Is that right?<br>
Allow me to tell you – about this town, the bounty, and the curse...<br>
<br>
Many decades ago, in the town mine...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Malin：</span><br>
Do we really need to blast it? I'm tired.<br>
Sure, the gold mine is blocked by rocks, but just let someone else do it...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Impero：</span><br>
All we have to do is fill it with explosives, right? There... Done. I'm going to sleep now.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dupleix：</span><br>
Part of me feels like the cast is all wrong... Anyway, it's dangerous here. No sleeping!<br>
Wake up! I'm about to detonate the explosives!<br>
Counting down!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Malin：</span><br>
Dupleix... W-wait! Impero put too many–<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dupleix：</span><br>
Three, two, one...<br>
<br>
*BOOOOOOOOOOOM!*<br>
The overly packaged explosives cause a cave-in, catching the miners in the wreckage.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Impero：</span><br>
Aah. I curse you. A curse upon gold mines and hard work.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Malin：</span><br>
I'm cursing it, too... Anyone who touches this gold mine will turn into a bunny...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dupleix：</span><br>
Why a bunny?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Malin：</span><br>
...Because they're cute?<br>
Okay, is our scene done now? Yaaay, break time.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
That's a pretty... random curse.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bristol：</span><br>
Ahem... Well, ever since the cave-in, the town's curse has spread.<br>
<br>
Bristol shows me to another part of the building.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bristol：</span><br>
Behold, stranger! That bunny right there is proof of the curse!<br>
<br>
The feeble light of the lamp barely illuminates the inside of a closet.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
I like this role...<br>
Zzzzz....<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Um?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bristol：</span><br>
This sleeping bunny was once Laffey, niece of Mayor San Diego.<br>
She didn't believe in the curse. So she went to the mine, and this is how she came out...<br>
Ever since, the mayor has promised a bounty to anyone who can put the spirits of that mine to rest.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Hmm... A gold mine cursed by spirits, huh?<br>
<br>
I ponder it for a moment. Bristol seems to mistake this for interest in the bounty.<br>
After shooting a quick glance out the window, she pushes me out of her home.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bristol：</span><br>
Farewell. Hopefully you can display your value amidst this chaos... Commander.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Wait!<br>
<br>
Ignoring my calls, Bristol slams the door shut in my face.<br>
A harsh gust of wind blows, making it hard to keep my eyes open. Afterward, the sandstorm passes.<br>
I look around again and find that the buildings have changed.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Hm? That house just turned into a tavern. It's like I'm in a whole new place...<br>
<br>
My horse absentmindedly chews on some hay in the stable behind the tavern.<br>
(When did I stable you? I don't remember doing that.)<br>
The lamp-wielding Bristol and mysterious sleeping rabbit are gone, too.<br>
Was that all just an illusion?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Well... Let's see if the tavern has any clues.<br>

<br>
When I go into the bar, I get a warm welcome.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bell：</span><br>
Welcome~ I'm Bell, your server today!<br>
Come in, sit down, order a drink~ Here's your menu! When you're ready, just give me a shout!<br>
<br>
After pushing a tattered, handwritten menu into my hands, Bell runs off while balancing a tray.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">大黄蜂：</span><br>
Hey there! Took you long enough, Commander. We've been waiting for ages.<br>
C'mon, get over here!<br>
<br>
When I notice Hornet trying to get my attention, I get up and walk–<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">???：</span><br>
Hm? Hornet, did you just call this person... Commander?<br>
Commander? Heheh... It looks like that bounty hooked one hell of a big fish.<br>
Pleasure to meet you. I'm Indiana, a bounty hunter.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Indiana：</span><br>
I came here to lift the curse on that mine. Commander, how about working with me?<br>
The two of us can split the bounty, 40-60. You get the 60, of course. What do you say?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">???：</span><br>
So eager to win over the Commander... Are you just going to ignore me~?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Indiana：</span><br>
I thought you weren't interested in the bounty, Pittsburgh.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pittsburgh：</span><br>
Weeell, I know I said I wasn't interested in any curses. But the Commander? That's a different story.<br>
<br>
She sits on the edge of the table, casually twirling her revolver around.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Herring：</span><br>
Hey, read the room!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">大黄蜂：</span><br>
We already got dibs on the Commander! Isn't that right?!<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Yeah!</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：Who are you, exactly?</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Herring：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''See? Straight from the horse's mouth! Now give up the ghost~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Herring：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''What?! You already forgot about us?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Herring：</span><br>
Anyway, we got to the Commander first! If you need to recruit, there are plenty of other candidates here.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">大黄蜂：</span><br>
Yeah. That nun drinking tea over there would be a good fit.<br>
<br>
Hornet points at a corner of the tavern.<br>
It's then that I realize that this tavern isn't just packed – it's full of ferocious fighters.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(A nun, a maid, and a witch...?)<br>
(What an odd breadth of occupations.)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pittsburgh：</span><br>
Heheh♪ At this point, I'm happy to let the Commander choose... What do you think, Indiana?<br>
Our plan's already failed~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Indiana：</span><br>
Too bad. If you won't join us, then we'll just have to treat you as a rival!<br>
I'm confident we can win that bounty first. Curse, spirit, whatever it is – I'd like to see it stand up to my gun!<br>
<br>
With a hearty laugh, Indiana swaggers over and claps a hand on my shoulder.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Indiana：</span><br>
We might be rivals now, but I'd love to work with you sometime, Commander.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pittsburgh：</span><br>
Heheh~ Now, now. Give these girls back their partner, please.<br>
I'd like our relationship to remain a little amicable, wouldn't you?<br>
<br>
Pittsburgh hops off the table, grabs me by the arm, and pushes me over to Hornet.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Herring：</span><br>
Whoa... She's even worse than the first one...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pittsburgh：</span><br>
Heheh, don't worry. I'm not interested in the curse. All I want is to observe your little trio's work, that's all.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">大黄蜂：</span><br>
That's cool and all, but we don't even know where to begin.<br>
Can't exactly stray too far from town, either, given how often the sandstorms are these days.<br>
Only the pizza from this tavern can make me feel better... Mm! Yeah, every pizza needs pineapples on top!<br>
<br>
When Hornet takes a big, happy bite of her slice of pizza, people in the tavern angrily protest her claim.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
You can praise the pizza, but maybe pick better phrasing...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">大黄蜂：</span><br>
Huh? Why? If you say so, Commander... *munch*... I'll be more careful!<br>
Anyway, I'm running short on cash. Fast.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Herring：</span><br>
Same here. If I can't get that bounty, I might have to resort to robbery...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Have you been here for a long time?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bell：</span><br>
Thanks for waiting~ Five cups of Pittsburgh's mixed juice. That'll be one thousand gold coins, please~!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pittsburgh：</span><br>
We'll pay at the counter after.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bell：</span><br>
Okaaay!<br>
<br>
Bell's conveniently-timed entrance answers my questions.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Herring：</span><br>
See? These prices are way too much for any normal person to afford!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Has it always been this expensive?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">大黄蜂：</span><br>
How should I know? It's been like this since we got here, at least!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pittsburgh：</span><br>
Heehee♥ It's okay, Commander. If money is what you need...<br>
<br>
Pittsburgh gulps down her drink and sidles over to me, seemingly tipsy.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Ahem. Uh, I appreciate the thought.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pittsburgh：</span><br>
Are you shy~? How cute...<br>
Sorry. That's enough teasing. I'll have you know that once upon a time, prices here were normal.<br>
It was only after the mayor issued her bounty and sandstorms ramped up that prices started to rise.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Hm? Another person saying that the sandstorms suddenly ramped up...)<br>
By the way, is Laffey – the mayor's niece – the only one cursed to be a rabbit?<br>
Or are there others?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bell：</span><br>
Ooh! Now that you mention it, Bristol ended up that way when she investigated the accident decades ago!<br>
<br>
The tavern's waitress was apparently next to me for a while now.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Bristol?<br>
(The person who let me in during the sandstorm was named Bristol. Is this a coincidence, or...?)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bell：</span><br>
Yep! She went missing at the mine. When someone finally mustered the courage to go looking for her, they just saw a single bunny nearby.<br>
Ever since then, the townspeople have kept their distance from the mine. The loss of its gold led to a gradual decline...<br>
Laffey wanted to prove that it wasn't cursed, for the sake of the town's future. And... Well, we know how that ended.<br>
But I heard all of this from U-556! I only moved into this town recently, so...<br>
If you're curious... Oh, she should be coming with a delivery soon. Ask her when she comes!<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=The Clues at Hand|选项=16|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<br>
The spirits' curse, Bristol contradiction, high prices, and growing frequency of sandstorms.<br>
Several different key phrases are involved in this mystery. But just when a vague idea comes to mind, something new comes to throw me into disarray again.<br>
While we wait for U-556 to come with her delivery, I tell Bell that I'm going for a walk and exit the tavern.<br>
During said walk, I find a flyer regarding the curse bounty. I take it off the wall and try to glean some valuable information from it.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
"We are offering 20% of all gold mine proceeds to whoever can rid us of this curse."<br>
So the bounty isn't even a set sum. It's just the promise of a new revenue stream.<br>
(If they really wanted to get rid of this curse, then they'd offer some advantage to people who came seeking the bounty.)<br>
(Like discounts on facilities... or at least not charging exorbitant prices.)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">???：</span><br>
W-watch out! Get out of the waaay!<br>
<br>
A girl's panicked voice interrupts my train of thought.<br>
I realize that I've wandered close to a pasture. The cows around me quietly munch on hay, save for...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">???：</span><br>
Waaaah... P-please help meee...<br>
<br>
The girl, riding one cow, desperately tries to keep her balance.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：(Glare intimidatingly at the beast.)</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：(Threaten it with your gun.)</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''...!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kersaint：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''W-wow...! You stopped it with just your eyes!<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''I whip out my revolver and fire a few shots at the grass in front of it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kersaint：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Whoa... It stopped because it sensed the danger...<br>
<br>
With her crisis resolved, Kersaint alights and thanks me.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
It was no big deal. By the way, why were you riding a cow...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kersaint：</span><br>
O-oh! When I was changing their hay, this one suddenly got rowdy...<br>
I tried to calm it down, but it threw me onto its back, and... Ooh...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Hay? The same that they normally eat?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kersaint：</span><br>
I don't know... I was just told to change it. Fargo's the one who knows this stuff...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Hmm. Where is this Fargo, then?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kersaint：</span><br>
She's right over there.<br>
<br>
Kersaint shows me to a nearby cowshed.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fargo：</span><br>
Commander approach confirmed. Happiness index increasing by 25.22%.<br>
Changing mode to "super friendly."<br>
Good morning, Commandeeer!<br>
You look like you're wondering how I know who you are! Haha☆ I've got secrets to keep, sowwy!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Okay... I won't ask. Can you tell me if the hay you're using in the pasture is the same as usual?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fargo：</span><br>
Sure is. Ever since the sandstorms started, we've had to rely on U-556 for all of our supplies.<br>
She delivered the hay, too.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
U-556 again, huh...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fargo：</span><br>
Oh, but there wasn't enough hay yesterday, so I went and harvested some myself.<br>
From the mine, that is.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
*gasp*<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Indiana：</span><br>
Commander, why are you here?<br>
<br>
I hear a familiar voice behind me.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Indiana?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Indiana：</span><br>
I was wondering why Pittsburgh suddenly asked me to look for you... So Fargo's been keeping you, huh?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fargo：</span><br>
I haven't done anything wrong. I'm simply answering the Commander's questions.<br>
<br>
Fargo's voice is emotionless again. Apparently, her "super friendly" mode has been disengaged.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Hm?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Indiana：</span><br>
Don't worry about it. She's harmless for now.<br>
Pittsburgh and the others are waiting. Let's hurry back.<br>
<br>
When we return to the tavern, Hornet quickly starts a lively conversation with Indiana and Pittsburgh.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Weren't you rivals before?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">大黄蜂：</span><br>
We still are, yep!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Indiana：</span><br>
Yeah. Being rivals doesn't mean we have to hate each other.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pittsburgh：</span><br>
That's right~ Things are a lot more relaxed now than when you left.<br>
<br>
While everyone chats, I hear the sound of approaching hooves.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-556：</span><br>
Prairie Knight U-556 has arrived with a delivery!<br>
<br>
While the townspeople unload the goods, I jump on the opportunity to approach her.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Courier duty, huh? You must be like a hero to the townsfolk.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-556：</span><br>
Heheh~ This is nothing, nothing~ Did you just come into town recently?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
You could tell I was an outsider?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-556：</span><br>
Yeah. Almost everyone's left this place, except for the ones moving in recently.<br>
Anyone else is sure to be a bounty hunter.<br>
But that's fine. It helps the economy here, after all.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Herring：</span><br>
Excuse you. This economy is beyond helping!<br>
And with all the sandstorms, nobody can ever leave!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-556：</span><br>
Don't act like it's our fault.<br>
These sandstorms weren't a problem before. They only started because you outsiders came and angered the spirits!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Hold on. You're saying there weren't any sandstorms before?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-556：</span><br>
Yeah. They started popping up after the first batch of bounty hunters blew in!<br>
And the more people came in, the more frequent they became! It's definitely because the spirits are mad!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
.........<br>
<br>
She's just given me an important piece of information without realizing – and it puts an idea in my head.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I think it's time I go see this so-called curse in person...<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=The Spirits' Revenge?|选项=17|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<br>
With a decision made, we decided to go back to the tavern on Indiana's suggestion.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">大黄蜂：</span><br>
Wait a second. Why are you acting like you're part of the team now?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Indiana：</span><br>
Following you all seems like fun. Besides, I had a feeling this bounty business was a little fishy, too.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Agreed. Apparently, there were other bounty hunters who came before you all.<br>
Where did they go? And... why have you made no gains whatsoever despite being here for so long?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Herring：</span><br>
Huh? You're right... I never even noticed.<br>
I guess because something weird would happen every time we tried to investigate...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Indiana：</span><br>
Now that you mention it, it is weird.<br>
Every time we tried to do something, some other idea would come up at a weirdly convenient time and wash that away.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pittsburgh：</span><br>
Heehee... Maybe that's why I have so little interest in the bounty.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
The way you're talking makes it sound like you know something, Pittsburgh. Mind sharing?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pittsburgh：</span><br>
Unfortunately, I don't know any more than you. I've just felt vague suspicion here and there.<br>
Spirits living in the gold mine, people turning into rabbits, being distracted from our plans, sandstorms whipping up whenever we try to leave...<br>
What do YOU think the curse is, honey?<br>
Or... do you think all of those coincidences are real?<br>
<br>
She lowers her voice. There's a strange, seductive glint in her ruby eyes.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pittsburgh：</span><br>
It's a mystery how you're unaffected, though...<br>
Would you mind telling us your little plan? Com-man-der?♪<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Indiana：</span><br>
Got it. Pittsburgh and I will stand by here.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pittsburgh：</span><br>
Geez. Here I thought I'd get to come along... Leaving me to bring up the rear is just rude.<br>
But it's fine. I'll just pray that all goes well tonight.<br>
<br>
Night falls, and Herring, Hornet, and I spring into action.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">大黄蜂：</span><br>
Weird. It's not like it's hard to find the mine, so why haven't we bothered trying yet?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Herring：</span><br>
I just realized something... We haven't met Mayor San Diego since we came to this town, have we?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">大黄蜂：</span><br>
Yeah! How'd I forget something so important?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Hush. We're almost there.<br>
<br>
While they talk, we approach the mine.<br>
There's an overgrowth of wild grass, but there are definite traces of it being culled by a sickle.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(So Fargo wasn't lying. The problem is the grass here... What makes it different?)<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：(Get a closer look.)</span>'''''<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Upon careful investigation, I find blackish marks on the grass near the entrance to the mine.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''(Are these black marks related to the curse?)<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''(Well, nothing to do but go in.)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Herring：</span><br>
Ahem! Commander... Uh, a-are you really planning to go in there?<br>
If the curse is real, and we're turned into rabbits...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">大黄蜂：</span><br>
Calm down, Herring! The Commander knows there's no curse. That's how we got this far, right?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Damn right!</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：I dunno...</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项3：Let's become bunnies and live a lazy life!</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">大黄蜂：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Yeah! The Commander's words fill me with determination!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">大黄蜂：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Huh? You're getting cold feet NOW?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">大黄蜂：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项3）</span>'''''Commander? Are you serious right now?!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Leaving the veracity of the curse aside, there must be other secrets hiding in here.<br>
You don't want to be stuck in this town forever, do you?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Herring：</span><br>
No, but...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Then let's go.<br>
<br>
The dark, cramped, and damp cavern winds on for seemingly forever.<br>
Hornet leads the way with a small kerosene lamp in hand.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Herring：</span><br>
Well... We've been walking for a long time now, and nothing has happened. It's almost as if there's nothing going on in here.<br>
<br>
Herring grumbles. Just then, we hear conversation in the distance ahead.<br>
Hornet quickly turns the lamp off, and we all slowly approach.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">???：</span><br>
Uh... Are you sure this is fine?<br>
Of course, nya. You don't have to worry about a thing, Mayor, nya!<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">San Diego：</span><br>
But Laffey... Akashi, are you REALLY sure this is fine? Really, really sure?<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">Akashi：</span><br>
Trust me, nya~ Laffey became a bunny because she wanted to, and business is better than ever, nya!<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">San Diego：</span><br>
That's true! It's growing like never before! Someday, it'll be as brilliant as the good old days!<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">Akashi：</span><br>
Nyahahaha... There you have it, nya! And I'm gonna make bank, nya!<br>
Let's ramp up the output, nya~ Increase the fake sandstorm frequency, and make it so nobody can ever leave again, nya~<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">San Diego：</span><br>
By the way, Akashi... Sandstorms are one thing, but that stuff you're putting into the food and water doesn't have any weird side effects, does it?<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">Akashi：</span><br>
Of course it's fine, nya~ The Akashi brand has a reliable track record~<br>
It's harmless – it just makes people dream based on simple suggestions, nya~ That's why the curse rumor spread so easily, nya!<br>
Rest assured that you're in good hands, nya. Stay here, and I'll use your title to make this town flourish like never before, nya!<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">San Diego：</span><br>
Thanks, Akashi! I'm such a genius for letting you do business here!♪<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">Akashi：</span><br>
Nyahahaha... I didn't think it'd be this easy to fool... I mean, I didn't think you'd be so trusting, nya!<br>
<br>
The tunnel up ahead has been rearranged like a workshop.<br>
One green cat skillfully operates the many mysterious machines within.<br>
There's also a single cage mixed in with the machines.<br>
The red-haired girl in the cage, Mayor San Diego herself, happily hums a tune.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(That's the mayor! Why is she in here?)<br>
(And Akashi, too... Are those machines and whatever she's putting in the food the real "curse"?)<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">San Diego：</span><br>
Hmm? I feel like I'm being watched... Staaare!<br>
<br>
San Diego suddenly stands up inside the cage and turns toward us. We make eye contact.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">San Diego：</span><br>
Akashi! We've got visitors!<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">Akashi：</span><br>
Nya?!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Oh, no!)<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=New Journeys|选项=18|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<br>
We run through the damp, narrow tunnel as fast as we can, but we can't shake off Akashi's pursuers.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">大黄蜂：</span><br>
*pant*... *pant*... So does that mean...<br>
The sandstorms, the curse, and our memory loss... Akashi was behind it all?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Herring：</span><br>
Yeah! The gold mine was just a trap to lure us here and squeeze us for all we have!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">大黄蜂：</span><br>
If we ran out of money, we'd have no choice but to stay here and live in this town!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Herring：</span><br>
What a scheme...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
But if those sandstorms are an illusion made by Akashi's machines... that means we don't have to worry about them at all, right?<br>
<br>
As the light of the exit comes into view, we finally manage to escape the pursuit.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Herring：</span><br>
Let's just get out of here for now! We need to go tell everyone the truth!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Right!<br>
<br>
We make it back to the bar safely and tell our rivals what we learned about the mine.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Now that the secret of this town's been exposed, there's no reason for us to stay any longer.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">Akashi：</span><br>
Damn right, nya! 'Cause I'm gonna get rid of all of ya, nya!<br>
<br>
The green cat appears out of nowhere – with her lackeys from the mine in tow.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">Akashi：</span><br>
Akashi's always got a backup plan, nya!<br>
I built a tunnel under this town just to keep people like YOU from getting away with my secrets, nya!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Indiana：</span><br>
Heh. So you wanna fight? Right here, right now?<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">Akashi：</span><br>
Sure do, nya!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Indiana：</span><br>
Music to my ears. Bring it on!<br>
<br>
On Indiana's words, the sound of gunfire rattles the tavern.<br>
Pittsburgh and Indiana whip out their guns at lightning speed.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pittsburgh & Indiana：</span><br>
You ready, Commander?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Any time!<br>
<br>
*BANG!* *BANG!*<br>
After two gunshots, two of Akashi's pursuers fall to the floor.<br>
The tavern descends into chaos almost instantly. Tables and chairs go flying.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bell：</span><br>
Ooh, I hope the tavern can handle replacing all this stuff...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fargo：</span><br>
I recommend invoicing Pittsburgh for recompense.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet：</span><br>
Tch, Indiana's stealing my spotlight... Don't underestimate me, dammit!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Herring：</span><br>
Time to prove which one of us is faster!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet：</span><br>
Hell yeah!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Littorio：</span><br>
I've had ENOUGH of pineapple on pizza!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
Yeah! I'm fighting for real, authentic pizza!<br>
<br>
Seemingly ignited by the gunfire, the other people in the tavern gradually join in the mad melee.<br>
Bullets fly in all directions. The sounds of chairs and tables flying, and the tavern being destroyed, are ceaseless.<br>
At the end of it all, when dawn finally came, the tavern had finally calmed down. After that last gunshot, silence had returned.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">Akashi：</span><br>
Uugh... I lost, nya...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Indiana：</span><br>
Town rules dictate that we'd hand you over to the mayor, but...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pittsburgh：</span><br>
The mayor's in cahoots with her, anyway. Though I guess it did look more like she was getting tricked than anything...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Indiana：</span><br>
Not sure what to do here...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Herring：</span><br>
This is a big scandal. I think we need to elect a new mayor~<br>
What if we just lock her up until a new mayor takes office and then hand her over then?<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">Akashi：</span><br>
I can fix all this! Just don't lock me up, nyaaa!<br>
So many business opportunities still await, nya!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pittsburgh：</span><br>
Save it for the new mayor, please~<br>
<br>
Pittsburgh tightens the rope around Akashi's wrist.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">大黄蜂：</span><br>
What will you do now, Commander?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pittsburgh：</span><br>
Why even ask? Our only option is to make the Commander our new mayor~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">大黄蜂：</span><br>
You as the mayor, huh... Now that would make this town legendary!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
That's exactly why I need to leave.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">大黄蜂：</span><br>
Commander?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
You'll understand someday, Hornet.<br>
<br>
I gaze into the distance. The dilapidated town has taken on a more lively air under the dawn sun.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pittsburgh：</span><br>
Are you really going to leave us?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Yeah. New journeys await me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pittsburgh：</span><br>
Heehee. Of course... Then I'll pray for your good fortune.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Indiana：</span><br>
Goodbye, Commander.<br>
<br>
I take the reins from Indiana and climb onto my horse.<br>
After a gentle kick, it begins to walk.<br>
As the town gradually fades in the distance behind me, I realize the adventure ahead of me is long and perilous.<br>
(But that's just fine by me.)<br>
