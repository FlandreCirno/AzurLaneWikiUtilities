<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Belfast：</span><br>
It is my pleasure to inform you that we've successfully completed the first part of Her Majesty's supply delivery.<br>
The second convoy is expected to arrive later this day. Please make the necessary preparations for its arrival.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Avrora：</span><br>
We greatly appreciate your support. These supplies will surely be a great help in our battle against the Red Axis.<br>
Please inform Her Majesty that she has our gratitude and our blessings. God Save the Queen.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Belfast：</span><br>
Certainly. We are eagerly awaiting your future participation in the war. God Save the Queen!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Norfolk：</span><br>
Thank goodness... We've finally finished our last convoy mission... Now we can go home...<br>
Just the thought of getting to drink Belfast's tea again is helping me warm up inside~!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Belfast：</span><br>
We cannot let our guard down just yet. We may still encounter danger on our way back.<br>
Be it these freezing temperatures, or threats lurking beneath the surface...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sheffield：</span><br>
......<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Belfast：</span><br>
Sheffield, is something the matter? You haven't spoken much for some time now.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sheffield：</span><br>
That girl, Avrora... her smile didn't seem sincere to me.<br>
I don't believe we should trust the Northern Union.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Belfast：</span><br>
You're overthinking the matter. We have formed an alliance with them so we have every reason to mutually trust one another.<br>
Do you not agree that it is our duty as Royal Maids to have faith in Her Majesty's and the Commander's judgement?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sheffield：</span><br>
... Let's hope I'm simply being paranoid.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Belfast：</span><br>
... Now, according to our intel, there is a chance that we will encounter moderate Siren opposition on our way home, therefore I urge everyone to remain vigilant! Now, let us set sail!<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Belfast：</span><br>
(My sister once sailed across this same ocean... It must have been just as freezing back then...)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sheffield：</span><br>
... Vessels of an unknown identification signal detected at 12 o'clock. They are rapidly approaching.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Norfolk：</span><br>
T-they're enemies we've never encounter before?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Belfast：</span><br>
They must be the new models the Eagle Union warned us about. They indiscriminately open fire on any passing vessel... They are extremely troublesome, indeed.<br>
With the second convoy en route, we cannot simply ignore this threat.<br>
All units, enter battle formations! Let us show our enemies the courage of the Royal Navy!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sheffield：</span><br>
... Roger that!<br>

Glory to the Royal Family, and demise to all those that opposite it. God Save the Queen!<br>
<br>
...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Belfast：</span><br>
Your performance was splendid, everyone. It seems they were not so troublesome after all.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Norfolk：</span><br>
Thank goodness... Those new Siren models aren't all that scary. Or maybe we're just really strong...?<br>
Anyway, now we should hopefully be able to go home...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sheffield：</span><br>
Wait just a moment, please, Norfolk. I'm receiving an urgent message from headquarters...<br>
... Hmm...<br>
...<br>
... It seems we will have to take a detour.<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=Hunting Grounds|选项=4|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Belfast：</span><br>
We just received a message informing us that the second convoy has been attacked by Iron Blood forces.<br>
We had already anticipated this, and it would seem that we have a shark on the hook.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sheffield：</span><br>
One of the "ugly" ones?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Belfast：</span><br>
Correct. We have fought her in the past, but it seems this time we'll be able to settle things for good.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Norfolk：</span><br>
But we don't stand a chance if we go up against a battleship with our firepower...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Belfast：</span><br>
There is no need to worry. Headquarters has already taken precautions against the enemy. Duke of York should be en route to provide support.<br>
Our mission is simply to pursue and pester the supporting Iron Blood forces until Duke of York has arrived.<br>
Matchless, Musketeer, may I ask you to provide reconnaissance?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Matchless&Musketeer：</span><br>
Of course!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Belfast：</span><br>
Now then, ladies... It's time to reel in the catch!<br>

<span style="color:#ff0000;">Scharnhorst：</span><br>
We meet again, my Royal adversaries. Or should I call you a royal pain in my ass?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Belfast：</span><br>
I am Belfast, chief of the Royal Maids. The pleasure is all mine.<br>
Had it not been for your fleet's sudden visit, I could have been in Scapa Flow by now, brewing the afternoon tea for the young mistress...<br>
If you'll pardon my request, would you kindly scuttle yourself to make this easier for all parties involved?<br>
<span style="color:#ff0000;">Scharnhorst：</span><br>
Just as full of yourselves as ever, huh... I knew this battle would come one day.<br>
Good timing, too! My cannons have been aching for some target practice to warm up in this freezing weather!<br>
En garde, you pompous, tea-swigging bastards!<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Norfolk：</span><br>
Eek! My radar and engine have been hit... I can't continue fighting... I'm sorry...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Scharnhorst：</span><br>
Tsk... I don't have time for you little worms! I have more important things to do!<br>
Starboard, 150 degrees! Full speed retreat!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Belfast：</span><br>
Oh, are you going to run away once more? How unfortunate, I had just started enjoying myself...<br>
Sheffield, what's your current status? Will you be able to pursue her?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sheffield：</span><br>
I'm sorry, I'm having trouble with my engine... I won't be able to pursue at maximum speed.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Belfast：</span><br>
Understood. But, I would wager that she's bluffing and will turn to attack the convoy soon enough. How soon do you think you can affect repairs?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sheffield：</span><br>
A reasonable assumption. But if we can't repair quickly, you're intent upon going after her... alone?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Belfast：</span><br>
Those sisters have caused the Royal Navy far too much trouble... We have been given a chance to make them pay, and I will not let it slip by!<br>

You saw through my trick, huh... What do you think you, a lone light cruiser, can do to a battleship like me?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Belfast：</span><br>
I am prepared to fight tooth and nail for Her Majesty's and the Royal Family's glory and reputation.<br>
All guns, train sights on the enemy! Prepare to fire!<br>
<span style="color:#ff0000;">Scharnhorst：</span><br>
I was wrong to call you pompous. If you're going all out, then I too will treat you with respect and fight you with all my strength.<br>
Come at me! I hope you're prepared to be chewed into pieces!<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Belfast：</span><br>
... Gah!<br>
<span style="color:#ff0000;">Scharnhorst：</span><br>
Pretty good, for a maid. But I can tell you don't have much strength left, and soon the sharks will be nibbling at your feet...<br>
I will grant you a soldier's demise. All guns, train sights on...<br>
<br>
...<br>
<span style="color:#ff0000;">Scharnhorst：</span><br>
... What the?! Anton's been hit...?! Who did that?! Who the hell did that?! Who's the slimy little crumpet-munching island ape bastard out there who just signed her own death warrant?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Belfast：</span><br>
... I know very well that my 6-inch guns cannot penetrate your armour. However...<br>
My mission was simply to create a more favourable situation for my allies...<br>
Even if I were to perish here, I have already assured our victory... I hope you will enjoy having the Duke for company...<br>
My Majesty... I'm afraid it seems... I will no longer be able to brew tea for you... Ugh...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Duke of York：</span><br>
Sorry, but it is not thy time yet, housekeeper. The shark shall be mine to hunt.<br>
Destroyers, protect Belfast and evacuate right now!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Matchless & Musketeer：</span><br>
Roger! Deploying smokescreen!<br>
<span style="color:#ff0000;">Scharnhorst：</span><br>
Looks like the damn cavalry has arrived... You little rats managed to sneak up on me...<br>
That maid knew she couldn't pierce my armor, so she went for my radar, huh...<br>
Hmph. I guess this is it for me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Duke of York：</span><br>
Heheh, my sincerest apologies for interrupting thy duel. But now, thine opponent is me.<br>
Warm regards from the fifth ship of the George V-class, Duke of York.<br>
Fiiiiire!!<br>

Command, this is Scharnhorst! I will fight on until the last shell is fired!<br>
Caesar! Lock sights on Duke of York!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Duke of York：</span><br>
Thou tires me with thy prattle. Thy role here is over... Sink!<br>
<br>
...<br>
<span style="color:#ff0000;">Scharnhorst：</span><br>
... Ahahaha... My sister and I caused so much havoc in the North Sea that people started calling us "the Ugly Sisters"...<br>
Countless times I've managed to flee from danger, and yet, this is where it ends for me...<br>
By the hand of a bunch of arrogant Royal Navy ships, no less...<br>
<br>
……————<br>
<span style="color:#ff0000;">Scharnhorst：</span><br>
But that's what's so charming about you...<br>
... Auf Wiedersehen, servants of the Royal Family.<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Duke of York：</span><br>
Though her struggle was futile from the beginning, she was a warrior who fought until the very end.<br>
Sisters of the Royal Navy! The battle against Scharnhorst has ended in victory for us! However...<br>
I hope that any of thee who are ever called upon to fight against an opponent many times superior, will fight as gallantly as Scharnhorst fought today!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Belfast：</span><br>
......<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Duke of York：</span><br>
All right, girls. 'tis time to go home... There are still combat operations to be carried out.<br>
<span style="color:#ff0000;">Tester：</span><br>
I'm no longer receiving Scharnhorst's identification signal from the testing area.<br>
<span style="color:#ff0000;">Observer：</span><br>
Hmm, so it's just like back then with the Z Fleet... Giving her even more power doesn't affect the outcome.<br>
<span style="color:#ff0000;">Tester：</span><br>
But there's one thing that caught my interest.<br>
The second Royal Navy convoy heading for the Northern Union was sunk by planes.<br>
On the current settings, Iron Blood shouldn't have the strength to launch an aerial attack... So how could this happen...<br>
<span style="color:#ff0000;">Observer：</span><br>
According to the script... Next up, the Royal Navy should be the ones launching a large-scale aerial attack.<br>
In light of this information, we will have to observe them even more closely.<br>
We're leaving the North Sea in your hands, Purifier.<br>
<span style="color:#ff0000;">Purifier：</span><br>
Ahahahaha! Yay, it's finally my turn!<br>
<span style="color:#ff0000;">Observer：</span><br>
And if "she" gets in the way... Ahaha, well, you already know what to do.<br>
<span style="color:#ff0000;">Purifier：</span><br>
Of course! Oh, I'm going to have so much fun out there! Ahahahahahaha!<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Victorious：</span><br>
Special Task Force One has arrived at the objective. Rendezvous complete.<br>
Victorious of the Royal Navy has arrived!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Duke of York：</span><br>
Thou have cometh from far away. Dost thou still remember the Northern Sea?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Victorious：</span><br>
I may have always been fighting on the other side of the world, but... how could I possibly forget my birthplace and its nostalgic sea breeze?<br>
Oh, right, I've brought some fighter planes with me from the Eagle Union!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Duke of York：</span><br>
Is that so?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Victorious：</span><br>
Have a look! This little darling is known as a "Corsair"! It has specs comparable to our Seafires! And you wouldn't believe how many bombs it can carry!<br>
The Eagle Union's fighters are just so marvelous! And look at this, this is a Wildcat! It can...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Duke of York：</span><br>
Ahem... Returning to the topic at hand, what of the target?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Victorious：</span><br>
Ah, you'll have to excuse me. I can't help myself when I get excited...<br>
Ahem! My recon planes have already spotted the target. She hasn't moved an inch. Perhaps she can't even move at all?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Duke of York：</span><br>
The lone wolf of the north... Though struck by X-boats, she managed to survive. Truly, a defence most formidable.<br>
In any case, this is an opportunity for the Royal Navy to solve the threat in the Northern Sea once and for all.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Victorious：</span><br>
Indeed. As soon as this fog has cleared up, I'll send out my little darlings to attack!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Duke of York：</span><br>
...How reliable. Well then, all ships participating in this operation, standby! "Operation Tungsten" shall begin in one hour's time as planned!<br>
Our prey is Tirpitz! What meaningless resistance will she be able to mount? Fleet-<br>
<br>
……————<br>
……————<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Duke of York：</span><br>
What?! An attack from a new enemy? Report the damages, hurry!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Victorious：</span><br>
Is the ocean... falling apart...?!<br>
......<br>
N-no, it's something else... The ocean itself is being sucked up into the sky!<br>
<span style="color:#ff0000;">Purifier：</span><br>
Ahahaha~! What an interesting choice to create a singularity here!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Duke of York：</span><br>
Accursed Sirens, is this thy witchcraft?<br>
<span style="color:#ff0000;">Purifier：</span><br>
Huh? How exactly am I supposed to create a singularity of this size?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Duke of York：</span><br>
We have an emergency situation. Adjusting strategic operations. Prepare all forces for combat!<br>
Target the Siren! Fire at will!<br>
<span style="color:#ff0000;">Purifier：</span><br>
Hey! Didn't your momma teach you about listening to what people have to say? ...Fine, have it your way. Let's have some fun!<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Duke of York：</span><br>
Report to Headquarters: "30 minutes ago, Special Task Force One encountered the Siren and an unidentified superweapon... Our formation was broken."<br>
"Though we have managed to regroup, our fleet has already sustained over 40% damage. There is significant risk in continuing 'Operation Tungsten.'"<br>
"Requesting additional mission directives..."<br>
......<br>
...<br>
Bastards... the communications are jammed!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Victorious：</span><br>
I can't connect either... The situation is the same as in the Mirror Sea... We'll need to make do on our own...<br>
Fortunately, thanks to my armour, my little darlings went mostly unscathed.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Duke of York：</span><br>
As expected of the Royal Navy's armoured carriers. Does this mean that combat can continue?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Victorious：</span><br>
It does. We've already gotten this far, so we should pay a visit to this "Lone Queen in the North."<br>
I've even prepared something special, just for her.<br>
<span style="color:#ff0000;">Purifier：</span><br>
That's odd... Little Ms. Sunshine created such a massive singularity here, yet she's nowhere to be seen...<br>
Shame, I've always wanted to meet a Prototype, at least once~<br>
Oh well. I'd better send a message to the Observer~!<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Duke of York：</span><br>
Attention, members of Special Task Force One. Though we may have suffered a setback and lost communication with headquarters...<br>
The attack from the unidentified superweapon has parted the fog of war, the biggest uncertainty factor in our operation so far. Make use of this opportunity and attack!<br>
From here, we shall continue "Operation Tungsten!"<br>
Mobilise all usable carrier-based aircraft, and prepare to launch in 20 minutes time!<br>

Why, hello! There you are, Tirpitz!<br>
<span style="color:#ff0000;">Tirpitz：</span><br>
... Hmm...<br>
It's been long since anyone last came here. Especially someone as garish as you...<br>
First I hear a strange explosion, now a Royal Navy carrier has appeared before me...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Victorious：</span><br>
I am the armoured carrier Victorious, assigned to Special Task Force One. Greetings!<br>
You might be delighted to know that you're rather famous even on the other side of the world!<br>
And how long I've anticipated this mission! It's my chance to fight the Lone Queen in the North!<br>
Have a look at this souvenir from the Eagle Union! It's a specially constructed 1,600 lb armour-piercing bomb!<br>
<span style="color:#ff0000;">Tirpitz：</span><br>
...<br>
..."Lone Queen in the North," huh... I like the sound of that.<br>
I've lost count of how many battles I've had like this... But I will still fight with everything I have!<br>

<span style="color:#ff0000;">Tirpitz：</span><br>
... Was that all...? It seems the only thing special about that bomb was its name.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Victorious：</span><br>
You've nearly been bombed to pieces, yet you won't surrender?! You're going to sink if you let this continue!<br>
<span style="color:#ff0000;">Tirpitz：</span><br>
So you want me to surrender, huh...<br>
... Sorry, that's not happening. As a battleship, it's my wish to continue fighting till the very end.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Victorious：</span><br>
Just how obstinate can you Iron Blood ships be?! Your sister said the same thing!<br>
<span style="color:#ff0000;">Tirpitz：</span><br>
Bismarck...?! You've... met my sister...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Victorious：</span><br>
I have! We had almost the entire Royal Navy fighting your sister, me included. All I did was monitor her from a long distance with my planes, though...<br>
Still, it's true, Bismarck said those very same words!<br>
<span style="color:#ff0000;">Tirpitz：</span><br>
......<br>
... I see... Thank you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Victorious：</span><br>
Huh? Thanks for what...?<br>
<span style="color:#ff0000;">Tirpitz：</span><br>
She upheld her own beliefs, even till the very end, and sunk with the greatest service record ever seen.<br>
Even in our world, her name will long remain in the memory of many people...<br>
To us Iron Blood battleships, there's nothing more tragic than leaving your fate in the hands of others and being forgotten, having achieved nothing...<br>
And I have you to thank for coming here and giving me one more chance to fire my cannons...<br>
If I must trade my existence for one last honorable battle... then that's fine.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Victorious：</span><br>
......<br>
What are you saying?! This is no honourable way to go!<br>
What are you, the Drama Queen in the North?! Or do you just want to look cool?! I'm offering you the chance to live, and you refuse...?!<br>
<span style="color:#ff0000;">Tirpitz：</span><br>
......<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Victorious：</span><br>
You're making ME out to be the villain here...<br>
... Fine. I give up. Task Force One, we're pulling out. Turn 180 degrees and advance at half speed.<br>
<span style="color:#ff0000;">Tirpitz：</span><br>
... You're leaving? This is your chance to earn glory, your chance to make glorious history...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Victorious：</span><br>
Of course honour and glory are appealing... But I can't stand to earn them this way...<br>
W-what I mean is... my planes are out of fuel, that's all! ...My word, how lucky for you! Hmph!<br>
Message to flagship Duke of York...<br>
"The 'Queen in the North' has been seriously damaged, but could not be sunk. Operation Tungsten has ended in failure..."<br>
<span style="color:#ff0000;">Tirpitz：</span><br>
... What an unpredictable lady...<br>
... I doubt we will ever meet again...<br>
……<br>
I wonder how far your compassion will get you... I hope to one day find out...<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Duke of York：</span><br>
Members of Special Task Force One, we have inflicted devastating damage upon Tirpitz. Our combat objectives have nearly been accomplished.<br>
Due to the intervention of the Sirens, "Operation Tungsten" will conclude prematurely out of safety considerations. All members, prepare to return!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Victorious：</span><br>
……<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Duke of York：</span><br>
However, for her to not sink despite all that... is her armour impenetrable?<br>
Thou need not be so depressed. We miscalculated the strength of the enemy, but there will still be other opportunities in the future.<br>
<br>
……————<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Victorious：</span><br>
Alert! We've shot down enemy fighters! We're detecting something at 3 o'clock!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Duke of York：</span><br>
3 o'clock...! That must be the "singularity" that the Sirens mentioned?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Victorious：</span><br>
Yes! I haven't confirmed the enemy's position yet, but I've ordered my recon planes to investigate...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Duke of York：</span><br>
……<br>
Allowing the Sirens to run rampant in our waters is a disgrace to the Queen's name.<br>
Attention, all members of Special Task Force One! There has been a change in plans. Investigate these unknown waters and prepare for a Siren attack!<br>
By the way, Victorious...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Victorious：</span><br>
Yes?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Duke of York：</span><br>
The shape of that "singularity..."<br>
Does it not resemble the shape of a Queen's crown?<br>

<span style="color:#ff0000;">Purifier：</span><br>
Aha, I knew from the very beginning that this is where you'd be~!<br>
You've caused a lot of trouble for us, you know~ What are even you hoping to achieve, Ms. Prototype? ...Or should I say "Code G"?<br>
<span style="color:#d6341d;">Enterprise：</span><br>
... This has nothing to do with you.<br>
<span style="color:#ff0000;">Purifier：</span><br>
Now now, don't go anywhere! I just did the calculations, and if this massive singularity were to collapse, half of the entire Northern Union would go poof!<br>
And should that happen, it'd REALLY throw a wrench into our plans for this time period! So... could you be nice and just stop?<br>
<span style="color:#d6341d;">Enterprise：</span><br>
...  (The mysterious character silently turned her head the other way.)<br>
<span style="color:#ff0000;">Purifier：</span><br>
If you insist on continuing anyway... then I will use all the tools I have available to me as a subprogram to stop you!<br>
<br>
……————<br>

Target confirmed! All hands, continue to fire!<br>

Ahahaha! I knew you'd come here!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Victorious：</span><br>
Barracuda Unit, spread your wings! Target that powerful Siren...<br>
Wait, what's this other identification signal? She hasn't even appeared on the radar yet!<br>
<span style="color:#d6341d;">Enterprise：</span><br>
……<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Victorious：</span><br>
Corsair Unit, change target! Go for the unidentified enemy unit!<br>
<br>
……————<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Victorious：</span><br>
She... shot down all my Corsairs?!<br>
With her own Corsairs, at that?! ...Who are you?!<br>
<span style="color:#d6341d;">Enterprise：</span><br>
... So it's you, Victorious...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Victorious：</span><br>
Um... have we met before? More importantly: are you friend or foe?<br>
<span style="color:#d6341d;">Enterprise：</span><br>
Seems there was an error in our calculations...<br>
Purifier, go tell your damned computer terminal to never drag uninvolved people into your experiments again.<br>
<span style="color:#ff0000;">Purifier：</span><br>
Wow, that was easy~ I should've just called on these guys to stop you instead of trying it myself!<br>
<span style="color:#d6341d;">Enterprise：</span><br>
... Victorious...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Victorious：</span><br>
Y-yes?<br>
<span style="color:#d6341d;">Enterprise：</span><br>
I'm glad I got to see you again.<br>
You might not believe it, but... in the future... you were an outstanding warrior.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Victorious：</span><br>
Uhh... thanks?<br>
Wait... Hold on! Are you just going to run away after telling me that random nonsense?!<br>
<span style="color:#ff0000;">Purifier：</span><br>
Ahaha~ Calm down, lady. There's no point chasing after her anyway. And in case you forgot: I'm your opponent here!<br>
Still, I have you guys to thank for fixing that little problem for me~<br>
To reward you, I'll beam you full of energy with my little toy here!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Duke of York：</span><br>
Those are... lasers?! Everyone, watch out!<br>

<span style="color:#ff0000;">Purifier：</span><br>
Hahahahaha~! It's been ages since I've had this much fun! The sky really is the limit for the potential of your Wisdom Cubes!<br>
Listen here! We, the Sirens, are your enemy! We are the big bad meanies who take your oceans as our own! We are the ones who cause all the wars in the world! And don't you forget it!<br>
Next time we meet, I'll have an even more powerful weapon for you guys! Until then, stay alive and get stronger for me! Hahahaha~!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Duke of York：</span><br>
By the glory of the Royal Family, spill thy blood before us! Return to the icy abyss that you crawled from!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Victorious：</span><br>
Phew... We did it... Our connection to HQ has been restored, so the ocean should soon return to normal, too...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Duke of York：</span><br>
Good grief, I never expected such a situation to develop...<br>
But luckily, we managed to seize an unexpected victory as well as gather valuable intelligence on the Sirens.<br>
O valiant one, thy performance was pivotal to our outcome today. Victorious, it was an honour to fight at thy side.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Victorious：</span><br>
Why, thank you!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Duke of York：</span><br>
There's another communication from headquarters. They suggested to leave Tirpitz to the base's air squadron.<br>
That settles it then. We can go home now!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Victorious：</span><br>
……<br>
So the Queen in the North has been deprived of her crown... But I suppose that's what she wanted...<br>
... Oh, dear me, I'm getting distracted again...<br>
<span style="color:#ff0000;">Tester：</span><br>
So you had Victorious' planes shot down to lure her in... Well planned.<br>
<span style="color:#ff0000;">Observer：</span><br>
It was my only choice for dealing with Code G. Fortunately, it didn't cause a major discrepancy in the end.<br>
And our only loss was a single Purifier model. Wouldn't you agree this was the best possible outcome?<br>
<span style="color:#ff0000;">Tester：</span><br>
I suppose... So, have you gotten used to your new body yet, Purifier?<br>
<span style="color:#ff0000;">Purifier：</span><br>
Pheeew! I had the time of my life! I even gained tons of combat experience!<br>
Those Royal Navy girls should experience their awakening soon, so the North Sea should be good for a while.<br>
Anyway, c'mon, send me out on my next mission already~<br>
<span style="color:#ff0000;">Observer：</span><br>
Ah, yes, your next mission...<br>
How would you like to see cherry trees in full bloom?<br>
