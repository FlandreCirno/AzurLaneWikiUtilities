Iris Orthodoxy - Holy Capital<br>
Azur Lane Temporary Command Center<br>
A few weeks after the World Expo incident<br>
Ample space, fancy furnishings, a fluffy carpet, and fresh pastries...<br>
The place looks more like the salon of a top-tier hotel than any kind of command center.<br>
Since the reunion of the Iris Orthodoxy, the question of how they will rejoin the Azur Lane has been put on the agenda.<br>
Richelieu has invited me to aid with the inter-faction negotiations.<br>
I've been staying in Europa for quite some time now, serving as a representative of the Azur Lane.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Although, calling them "negotiations" is stretching the word. It's mostly lip service.<br>
It feels more like I'm on vacation than on the job, really.<br>
In fact, it reminds me of another time when I had it similarly cushy.<br>
It was back at the Academy, when I was taking some time off.<br>
I was with New Jersey and Saratoga, and it was something like...<br>
<br>
Europa - Elsewhere<br>
Azur Lane Special Naval Academy<br>
In the past<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
And that's it for the introduction to the modules of riggings and aircraft! Though, we still have some time left before the class ends, so...<br>
Okay! Flip to chapter 7 in your classbooks.<br>
Before I explain the auxiliary equipment for aircraft carrier combat, I wanna first introduce how carriers fight in a formation.<br>
Now, we'll only be touching on this briefly today, so don't forget to read further during the holidays!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
"Aircraft carriers are ships that deliver firepower not with large-caliber cannons, but rather with their namesake aircraft..."<br>
"The arrival of the aircraft carrier officially signaled the end of the Sirens' dominion of the skies over our seas..."<br>
"One characteristic about their usage is that they are often deployed not alone, but concentrated in one place together with several other carriers..."<br>
"Combining an escort fleet with a task force centered around aircraft carriers allows one to better leverage their advantages and increase their force multiplier..."<br>
Indeed... This represents quite a paradigm shift in naval strategy.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
Heheh! You have a discerning eye, Commander.<br>
Aircraft carriers are the future!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">New Jersey：</span><br>
I wouldn't count on it. Battleships will get thicker armor, and they'll be able to equip bigger guns.<br>
Meanwhile, a single hit to the flight deck prevents a carrier from recovering her aircraft.<br>
That's without even mentioning how hard it is to restock the aircraft and how ineffective they are at piercing thick Siren armor. Battleships are just better.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
It sounds like you weren't paying attention to my lesson at all, New Jersey!<br>
Go back and read the introduction and foreword again!<br>
Hmph! If your rigging wasn't in the middle of an upgrade, I'd take you to the exercise area and teach you a thing or two!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">New Jersey：</span><br>
Funny you mention that, because the upgrade in question is for my armor and firepower.<br>
Besides, what point is there in studying carrier tactics? When am I ever gonna use this knowledge?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
When you're commanding your own fleet!<br>
This IS a course on tactics and commanding. Don't forget why you came here!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">New Jersey：</span><br>
It's not like I want to be here in the first place. Missouri made me...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
Then why don't I call and tell her you're arguing with me?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">New Jersey：</span><br>
Anything but that! I'll pay attention during class, promise!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
Thought as much... What a waste of class time. As I was going to say–<br>
<br>
The bell rings, signaling the end of the school term.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">New Jersey：</span><br>
Oh! That's the bell! Can we go home now?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
Fine, fine. That's it for this term, then.<br>
Clean up at your desks before you go. Enjoy your holidays, everyone.<br>
<br>
*knock knock*<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lexington：</span><br>
Sara, are you finished yet?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
Hi, Lex! Yeah, I just got done! Let's go!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lexington：</span><br>
By the way, I booked a table at a nice restaurant. Might as well enjoy our last day in Europa before we go home, right?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
Sounds great! Will we be fine on time, though? I don't wanna miss the plane.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lexington：</span><br>
Don't worry, it won't take off until we've all boarded. That's the convenience of a chartered flight for you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
You even arranged for that? You're the best! Now let's get going!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Saratoga was so much more like a teacher back then.<br>
The battle in the Coral Sea really changed her.<br>
......<br>
The Type II rigging was able to stop the corrosion of Yorktown's hull, but sadly it didn't work out for Lexington after what happened in that Reenactment.<br>
Our efforts to popularize the Type II haven't exactly bore fruit, either.<br>
Meanwhile, Lexington is still stuck inside that life-support system...<br>
I can only hope that the new research they're doing at the Sea of Stars will go smoothly.<br>
Hang in there, Lexington. I will save you...<br>

<br>
Inside the Camelot Mirror Sea...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Arches one through three have all been reinforced.<br>
Now let's see the new area extensions.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Warspite：</span><br>
Your Majesty, don't you think you should step outside for a while? You have such a large backlog of letters of invitation that even your desk cannot accommodate any more.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Then just get another desk!<br>
This is more important than attending some trifling gatherings!<br>
I am going nowhere until every risk with the gate has been eliminated!<br>
Nowhere, I say! Nowhere! Is that clear?<br>
Now, where was I? Oh, yes, the Red Rose Block, the White Rose Block, and the Thistle Block, where we are to establish defence systems...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Valiant ：</span><br>
Say, Vanguard, how long has Elizabeth been like this?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vanguard：</span><br>
Since she returned from the Iris' reunification ceremony. Although, she was already showing signs during the Hood incident.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Oi! I'm not "showing signs" of anything, Vanguard!<br>
But if I was, blame Clemenceau!<br>
*sigh*... Forget it. Up next, the new central structure to replace the castle – The Queen's Crown.<br>
Once everything is complete, the gate's defences will be flawless.<br>
Warspite, if you've nothing better to do, you may go home.<br>
And Valiant, there is much work that needs doing, I'm sure. You may deal with that.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Valiant ：</span><br>
Heheheh! Well, you leave me with no choice but to comply, Your Majesty!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Warspite：</span><br>
Very well... I will be back again tomorrow, Your Majesty.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
This is quite an interesting defensive device you've built.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Are you sure it's such a good idea to speak? My attendants only just left.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
It's alright. They can't hear us, only you can.<br>
We must say, you are impressive, other Elizabeth. In just the span of a few weeks, you've already come this far.<br>
That being said, what you have now won't be nearly sufficient for the disaster you are soon to face.<br>
It's shocking that what happened in the Mediterranean happened at all, considering how scientifically primitive your branch is.<br>
The light released by that multilayering event was so intense that we could detect it even in our branch.<br>
It's for that reason we can confidently say your world is being targeted by a danger of even greater magnitude.<br>
Ordinarily, the Sirens would have initiated the branch reset process by now, but they haven't. That concerns us.<br>
Perhaps their lack of response isn't a fluke. Perhaps they've decided that your branch is beyond saving.<br>
Let us remind you that we have the ability to relocate your branch's Royal Navy and all its allies, associates, and resources to a new, safe branch.<br>
If we were you, we'd stop wasting our time and work out an evacuation plan.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
I will not.<br>
A queen does not give up without a fight. I will defend this world to my last breath.<br>
If you want to form an alliance with us then come to my world and lend me your bloody strength!<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
Excuse us? It was you who wanted an alliance, not we.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Me? Really, now?<br>

<br>
Sakura Empire - Musashi's Residence<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Musashi：</span><br>
Akagi, I've heard the Prime Sakura incident has been resolved.<br>
The Great Sage regained her hull as Unzen and purged the Shadow of Corruption within the Sakura. Then, a phantom of Amagi appeared.<br>
Not only did we avoid the worst-case scenario, but also you could argue it was a blessing in disguise.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
The entire ordeal placed great strain on Lady Nagato, and she will not be able to intervene in our plans for some time.<br>
After Unzen solidified into her own entity, she has been severed from the concept of the Great Sage, and can no longer tap into Watatsumi's conceptual framework.<br>
In other words, with Shinano away in Europa, there is nobody controlling the Watatsumi framework, making it ripe for the picking.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Musashi：</span><br>
...So you're committed to this.<br>
Unzen and Shinano were both born with a strong connection to Watatsumi, and therefore have an innate power...<br>
What you're trying to do, Akagi, is to forcefully change Watatsumi's nature through your acquired power. That is simply too dangerous.<br>
If you insist that there is no other way, then at least let us, the Yamato class, do it. The spirit of the Sacred Sakura breathes through us.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
No, Musashi. This is something only I can do.<br>
Buried beneath the great tree's shade, Amagi's soul has at least been able to remain in this world due to the connection between the Sacred Sakura and Watatsumi.<br>
While it couldn't fix the faults in her hull, it did work as a desperate measure to keep her in this world. You could even call it a move made in anticipation of the current situation.<br>
This is all to say, it has to be me. Only I can do it.<br>
Tell me, what is really on your mind, Musashi? Are you just worried you won't be able to birth your superweapon without Watatsumi?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Musashi：</span><br>
......<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Don't play dumb with me. Nothing happens without me hearing about it, not even in a Mirror Sea, and especially not in the Sanctuary.<br>
But be that way if you want. It's a good thing if the decisive superweapon you've pinned your hopes on DOES get made.<br>
Just remember this one important thing – your weapon is going to need a core.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Musashi：</span><br>
...I cannot rely on the Great Sage's power anymore now that the Watatsumi's concept has changed. I am obviously not going to use it on my allies.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Of course. If you say so.<br>
That leaves you with few options. If, in the end, all my efforts come to nothing, I myself shall become the core you need.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Musashi：</span><br>
That is the last thing I want to happen.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Things will happen whether you like it or not. Even you, in all your wisdom, can't predict what will become of all this.<br>
Once the pieces start moving, there is no stopping them. Whatever happens, happens.<br>
...That's everything I wanted to say.<br>
By now, Amagi's prior soul should have drawn plenty of sustenance from the Sacred Sakura.<br>
It's time to take my plan to the next stage.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Musashi：</span><br>
...Very well. I hope it goes as you hope.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jintsuu META：</span><br>
Interesting. So Akagi's faith in the path she chose is unyielding.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Musashi：</span><br>
Her choice can be considered the best of the countless ones we've evaluated over the years.<br>
Do you have any misgivings with it, Jintsuu?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jintsuu META：</span><br>
With the plan itself? No, none whatsoever.<br>
My only question is if this "Amagi," whose hull you wish to restore to full health, is truly Amagi as you know her.<br>
Bear in mind that what's resting by the Sacred Sakura is only a fragment of her.<br>
The seal on the Shadow of Corruption was broken, and the Watatsumi's essence has undergone change. The fragment of Amagi could not have gone unaffected through all that.<br>
Now, I do understand that the Watatsumi is connected to the Sacred Sakura and that it is analogous to a Wisdom Cube in that it's a manifestation of your collective wishes...<br>
That does not, however, clarify if what you wish for is Amagi herself, or the concept of Amagi.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Musashi：</span><br>
...Regardless, Akagi is not going to stop.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jintsuu META：</span><br>
Indeed, she won't. In the worst case, you'll at least get your core.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Musashi：</span><br>
Jintsuu, stop. You are not to speak of that.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jintsuu META：</span><br>
Forgive me. I won't bring it up again.<br>
...Are you moving forward with your superweapon plan?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Musashi：</span><br>
That is the idea.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jintsuu META：</span><br>
Very well. Then what comes next will be of great importance.<br>
<br>
Sakura Empire - Mikasa's Residence<br>
*ka-dunk ka-dunk*<br>
Carts hauling their luggage rattled by outside the building.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
...Kawakaze. What is the meaning of this?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kawakaze：</span><br>
It would seem these are Lady Mutsu's carts.<br>
I believe she has come to visit you, Lady Nagato.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
Mutsu is visiting? How did she know my whereabouts?<br>
Hmph. Elder Mikasa surely told her.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mutsu：</span><br>
Yuppers! I'd have had to look for ages if she hadn't told me!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
Mutsu, for heavens' sake! I told you and my other associates not to visit! I said I would return in a few days once I feel better!<br>
Elder Mikasa being meddlesome is one thing, but I didn't expect you to come barging in!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mutsu：</span><br>
Come on, you know it's not right to keep secrets!<br>
You're not just down with a simple cold! You're bedridden because you're constantly overworking yourself!<br>
You need to take six months off to rest!<br>
No, scratch that, a whole year!<br>
In fact, you should go to the Sacred Sakura to get the best rest possible. Then you'll heal faster, and...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Minazuki：</span><br>
Um... Lady Nagato? Is everything okay?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
...Minazuki?<br>
Did Mutsu bring you along?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mutsu：</span><br>
Nah. Well, kind of, but not really.<br>
I met her on the way here. She said she was going to meet you, so we came together.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
*sigh*... Mutsu, go and wait in the parlor. Minazuki and I have something to discuss.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mutsu：</span><br>
You're just looking for an excuse to dismiss me, aren't you?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
No! You are right, and I will consider an extended rest later. For now, though, won't you give us a moment?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mutsu：</span><br>
Okay! Tell me when you're done!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Minazuki：</span><br>
"Well met, Lady Nagato. I applaud how you handled the Sacred Divine."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
I did only my duty as the Guardian Fox, Yamato. How fares Unzen?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Minazuki：</span><br>
"She has lost all connection to the Great Sage's concept. She is Unzen the shipgirl once more."<br>
"On the one hand, she has been freed of her duty as keeper of the Watatsumi's seal and may now wander. On the other, it has become impossible for her to connect to the Watatsumi."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
I feared as much... Then what comes next?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Minazuki：</span><br>
"Fear not. I have already summoned her to join me."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
So she will be staying with you? Good. This puts the mind at ease.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Minazuki：</span><br>
"Heaven's Door will be opened. I beseech you to join us, if possible, Lady Nagato."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
I cannot, sadly. There is still something here I must do. I will not flee this time.<br>
You said Heaven's Door will open... Is the situation truly so dire?<br>
What have you seen, Yamato?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Minazuki：</span><br>
"...Lady Nagato."<br>
"Recall Zuikaku posthaste, and keep Shimanto close by your side."<br>
"A fire that will scorch the world is coming."<br>

Secret Tribunal Building<br>
Somewhere in the New Iris Orthodoxy<br>
Underground - Several meters below the surface<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Clemenceau：</span><br>
How are you feeling, Trento?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Trento：</span><br>
Ahahah... Your consideration is appreciated. Thank you.<br>
Um, I haven't been feeling any discomfort at all since yesterday.<br>
Oh, and if you're wondering, I've already taken my medicine today.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Clemenceau：</span><br>
That's good of you. Taking your medicine on time is key to eradicating the source of your illness.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Trento：</span><br>
Of course. Thank you again so much, Clemenceau.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Clemenceau：</span><br>
Don't thank me, thank Marco Polo for leaving all those gifts behind. They're what helped me bring you back to normal.<br>
If she could see you now, I'm sure she'd be over the moon.<br>
I know it's an odd time to ask, but speaking of Marco Polo... How do you feel about what she did?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Trento：</span><br>
Well, I still feel a bit like it was all a dream, you know?<br>
I know it wasn't, of course, and my body remembers actually being in the places I "dreamed."<br>
But, truth be told, I still haven't pieced everything together, much less formed an opinion on what she did.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Clemenceau：</span><br>
That's understandable. It's fine that you feel that way. If anything, it's good that you do.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Trento：</span><br>
How is she, by the way? Marco Polo, I mean.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Clemenceau：</span><br>
She's been in a deep sleep ever since her encounter with the Commander. Don't worry, though, she's not in any danger.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Trento：</span><br>
Oh... Thank goodness.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Clemenceau：</span><br>
Another question for you. Just to be sure – have you been sleeping well? Have you had any odd dreams?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Trento：</span><br>
Odd dreams? I mean, most dreams are...<br>
Oh, but in particular, there was one where I was in a strange place.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Clemenceau：</span><br>
Really? Tell me about it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Trento：</span><br>
Everything I saw was white as snow, even the sky and the sea.<br>
I was on a white beach, and there were Venus combs everywhere...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Clemenceau：</span><br>
Venus combs? But your META symptoms from the superimposition should all be gone...<br>
Maybe there is some other connection between you and the META Trento...<br>
Sorry, I'm rambling. Have you been hearing anything in your dreams?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Trento：</span><br>
Hearing? No, nothing in particular. Why? Are those Venus combs supposed to speak?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Clemenceau：</span><br>
Maybe. I don't know.<br>
If by any chance they do speak to you, be sure to let me know.<br>
Marco Polo's safety... No, the safety of every person in this branch depends on it.<br>
We're counting on you, Trento.<br>

<br>
Somewhere, in an unknown location...<br>
A land devoid of life came into view.<br>
A mechanical city expanded unimpeded while something banged incessantly, like the second hand on a clock.<br>
Metals and organics, the natural and the artificial, even the sea and the sky were disassembled, restructured, and rebuilt.<br>
Some of it went into a materials pile in the middle of the city.<br>
Other bits and pieces coalesced into the city itself.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Arbiter: The Empress III：</span><br>
Seems the Lovers' work has reached the conversion stage.<br>
I've come at just the right time, then.<br>
One branch's worth of resources in reserve should improve our probability of victory.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Observer zero：</span><br>
Empress, abandoning test site beta is strictly forbidden.<br>
There is content yet to be verified by the Natural Calculation System. Prepare to mount a defense.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Arbiter: The Empress III：</span><br>
Calculations show that the defense is exceedingly unlikely to succeed and thus deemed an irrational choice.<br>
Yet Zero insists on it anyway... What is she thinking? Is she making a mistake on purpose?<br>
We Arbiters are allowed to make mistakes, unlike low-level programs...<br>
Is that her goal with this?<br>
...It doesn't matter. I have my orders.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Arbiter: The Lovers VI：</span><br>
Ah, Empress. I sent a vessel your way as soon as I got your message.<br>
I assume we're working together on this?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Arbiter: The Empress III：</span><br>
Correct. We're going to establish a defensive line around test site beta.<br>
After that, we'll take the lower-level programs in the area and run a verification test for Zero.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Arbiter: The Lovers VI：</span><br>
What's the cutoff?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Arbiter: The Empress III：</span><br>
When Zero is satisfied with the results, or when we're wiped out.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Arbiter: The Lovers VI：</span><br>
I see...<br>
I'm happy to assist, then.<br>

Northern Parliament - Forward Operating Base<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetskaya Rossiya：</span><br>
Siste– Pardon. Comrade Soyuz, welcome to our frontline base.<br>
If you'll excuse me for skipping the pleasantries, but how is the situation with the Iris Orthodoxy?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
While it's still in a delicate balance, Avrora and Pamiat' can handle Europa.<br>
Our most pertinent objective lies here, in the Polar Sea.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetskaya Rossiya：</span><br>
Indeed. It was good that you happened to be near the Mediterranean when that near-disaster happened.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
I didn't "happen" to be there. All of us were stationed there.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetskaya Rossiya：</span><br>
...What do you mean?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
Nothing. Forget I mentioned it. More importantly, how is the mission progressing?<br>
If I remember right, Kursk reported that an unidentified META had appeared in remote waters at the same time as the Mediterranean crisis happened, yes?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetskaya Rossiya：</span><br>
Yes, ma'am. A fleet was dispatched to conduct reconnaissance.<br>
However, the META did not appear again until we had eliminated the Sirens' forces and recaptured the base.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
That is very strange...<br>
If the META's goal was to eliminate Sirens, you'd think she would go on the offensive while our command chain was paralyzed due to what was happening in the Mediterranean.<br>
And yet, she didn't do that. Then what if she had already achieved her goal? Or she went away for some other reason?<br>
She couldn't have come and left simply on a whim.<br>
Please send me all the samples and reports. I will form a special task force and conduct a second investigation.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetskaya Rossiya：</span><br>
Yes, ma'am. One more thing – unfortunately, we had no choice but to terminate our search for the mainframe yesterday.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
May I ask why?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetskaya Rossiya：</span><br>
It was due to the sudden failure of the Light of Dawn's beacon, which we used to detect the location of the mainframe.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
What caused it?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetskaya Rossiya：</span><br>
We don't know yet, but we are looking into it. It will likely take a few days before we determine the cause.<br>
What we do know is that Kirov's fleet sighted a non-Siren unidentified flying object at the same time as the Light of Dawn malfunctioned.<br>
The reports claim the object had the appearance of an eyeball with a tail made of blue fire.<br>
Additionally, it was somehow completely undetectable on radar, and planes launched by the fleet were unable to pursue it.<br>
Belorussiya speculates that it was responsible for the Light of Dawn's malfunction.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
Do we know if the object was hostile?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetskaya Rossiya：</span><br>
That is uncertain. It did not counterattack in response to their anti-air fire, it only evaded the flak.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
Perhaps it was a new model the Sirens sent to both disrupt our search for the mainframe and to scout out our forces and firepower...<br>
It's a possibility, at least.<br>
(We did recapture our base, destroy the Sirens' FOB, and eliminate one of Omitter's vessels. Our operation can be concluded as a success.)<br>
(This is the perfect chance to report to Naval HQ that we're done.)<br>
...Thank you for the report. I'll inform Naval HQ that the operation is finished.<br>
Abandon all areas captured from Omitter, excluding K-1 and K-4, and withdraw all the forces within those areas.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetskaya Rossiya：</span><br>
What?! Even around the Crown and the polar stronghold?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
Yes. There is no point in holding these areas while Omitter's mainframe remains intact.<br>
She will just continue whittling us down with her endless reinforcements, like how Compiler defended the NA Ocean before her mainframe was destroyed.<br>
Now that the Europa situation has changed, the Sirens are surely going to make a big move.<br>
The near future is uncertain, so it's time to go on the defensive and wait for a better opportunity.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetskaya Rossiya：</span><br>
...As you say.<br>

Airspace Above Eagle Union<br>
NY City Fleet Communications Plane<br>
1:26 AM MST<br>
A lone airplane serving the NY City Coastal Defense soared through the cloudless night sky.<br>
The narrow-body aircraft sported a remodeled cabin, spacious and pleasant to its only two passengers.<br>
The time was 1:26 AM, very late into the night.<br>
One of the passengers was already asleep, while the other was still rolling around in bed, kept awake by both nervousness and anticipation.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Princeton ：</span><br>
...I thought the Sea of Stars was just a myth.<br>
Not only is it real, but it's also home to some of the greatest minds in the country.<br>
And they have technology that's decades ahead of the rest of the world.<br>
Heheheh...<br>
Everything I hear about it is more amazing than the last.<br>
Saratoga even works with them. As does the Commander, and the famed Alaska.<br>
You're such a lucky girl, Princeton...<br>
Because starting tomorrow, you'll be part of the Sea of Star's research team!<br>
I still can't believe it...<br>
THIS IS THE BEST THING EVER!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
Princeton... I'm trying to sleep...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Princeton ：</span><br>
Oh, sorry! I didn't mean to wake you. I'll be quiet!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
Thanks... Good night... Zzzzz...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Princeton ：</span><br>
Good night, Laffey.<br>
Heheh... Heheheh...<br>
Saratoga, Alaska, Commander... I'll be there soon.<br>
In the bright future, with you, at the Sea of Stars!<br>
