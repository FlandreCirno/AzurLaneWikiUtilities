Enterprise Troubles<br>
<br>
Chapter 1: The Strict Secretary<br>
Port - Office<br>
I stayed up way too late last night finishing up the paperwork, and ended up oversleeping.<br>
By the time I rushed over to the office, Essex had already begun working.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："H-Hey, Essex..."</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Essex：</span><br>
Oh, Commander. Good morning.<br>
You're rather late today. Did something come up?<br>
Explain the situation to her<br>
Hmm... so you were burning the candle at both ends...<br>
Commander, as the leader of the fleet and the port, it would be best if you took care of yourself, not just your work.<br>
In that regard, helping you manage your schedule is also one of my duties as secretary.<br>
You have nothing to worry about. From now on, I will monitor your daily routine from dawn 'till dusk.<br>
With that said, you should immediately attend to today's work.<br>
These are the documents that require your review. I've already sorted the majority of them for your convenience.<br>
Next, please pay attention to today's itinerary: conduct training exercises, take inventory on commission rewards, plan out the daily patrols, apply for new research and development projects, and then...<br>
There's a lot of stuff on the list, but just try to get through things one at a time.<br>
<br>
Looks like my daily routine from now on will be quite... strict.<br>

<br>
Chapter 2: A Gathering of Juniors<br>
Essex and I went on the scheduled port patrol, in accordance with her itinerary.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Essex：</span><br>
There's nothing out of the ordinary here. Moving on...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Centaur：</span><br>
Ah, is that... Commander! Elder Essex! Good day!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Essex：</span><br>
E-Elder?! You're that... Royal carrier, Centaur, aren't you...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Centaur：</span><br>
Yes ma'am! Elder Essex, are you in charge of patrols today? Thank you for your service!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Essex：</span><br>
I-I guess I am... Looking after the port is just part of my job. It's really no big deal.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Centaur：</span><br>
Mm... I see that you're as dedicated as they say you are, Elder Essex. Sorry for interrupting you then.<br>
<br>
After greeting us, Centaur left almost as suddenly as she showed up.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Essex：</span><br>
So that's the girl who calls everyone an Elder, huh...<br>
... as if I'd deserve a title like that anyway...<br>
<br>
Port - Sakura Dorms<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Essex：</span><br>
The Sakura Empire dorms, huh... this must be where that woman stays...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Yooo! Commander, doing your rounds? Oh, Essex is with you too! Congratulations on becoming the new secretary!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Essex：</span><br>
... Of course she's the first one out...<br>
A-ahem! Good day, Zuikaku of the Sakura Empire.<br>
(This is the woman that Enterprise has acknowledged as her rival!)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Good day to you too! H-huh? Why are you glaring at me? Is my hair messed up?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Essex：</span><br>
Sorry, it's nothing...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Ah, that reminds me! Essex, you're Enterprise's junior, aren't you?<br>
Heheh, perfect timing! When you have a chance, can you tell her that I'll be waiting for her in the exercise area over there tomorrow afternoon?<br>
Oh right, also gotta tell her, "I'm not gonna lose to you again!" Hehe!<br>
Anyway, I have to get going. See you later!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Essex：</span><br>
... Zuikaku, before you start thinking about beating Enterprise...<br>
... You should worry about getting through me first...!<br>

Chapter 3: Enterprise<br>
Port - Office<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Essex：</span><br>
All right. We're almost done with today's tasks. Commander, once you finish checking this report, we'll be done for the...<br>
<br>
*knock* *knock*<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
Pardon me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Essex：</span><br>
Huh? E-Enterprise?! I, I'll go get you some water!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
So you're the secretary now, Essex? Thanks for the hard work. I'm fine without the water.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Essex：</span><br>
H-how about tea?! Do you drink tea?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
You don't need to be so tense. I'm just here to give a status update.<br>
Anyway, that's the situation. The higher-ups at the Eagle Union have staged an individual mock battle tournament for the carriers.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Essex：</span><br>
Individual mock battles?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
Sorry, I guess nobody's briefed you about them before. To keep things short...<br>
That's pretty much how it goes. So, Essex, are you going to participate?<br>
It'd be a good opportunity to show off your specs as a state-of-the-art carrier.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Essex：</span><br>
(In other words, I'll finally have a chance to square off with Enterprise...)<br>
Please allow me to join!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
That's the spirit. I look forward to facing off against you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Essex：</span><br>
Same here. I won't go down without a fight!<br>
I... I said all that to sound tough, but I'm going to facing Enterprise for real...<br>
If I don't make the proper preparations, I'm just going to make a fool of myself.<br>
Starting tomorrow... no, today, I've got to plan things out!<br>
Sorry, Commander, but can I ask you to help me train?<br>
<br>
And with that, Essex's special training regimen began.<br>

<br>
Chapter 4: Essex Versus Enterprise<br>
Training Area<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
This is the last round! Congratulations for making it through all the competition. I'd expect nothing less from you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Essex：</span><br>
I would congratulate you too, but you don't seem to have broken a sweat.<br>
I'm not like the others though. I'm about to show you what I'm made of, so don't take me lightly!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
Don't worry, I always give it my all. Come!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Essex&Enterprise：</span><br>
Haaaaaah!!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet：</span><br>
Woah... things are getting intense~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yorktown：</span><br>
It's nice to see them go all out every now and then, hehe.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Essex：</span><br>
How's this!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
Not bad! But you've still got a long way to go!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Essex：</span><br>
I've already seen through your attacks! Now it's my turn!<br>
<br>
——！！<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yorktown：</span><br>
That's enough!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet：</span><br>
Woah, is this a double K.O.?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
So it's a draw, huh... I'm not sure how I feel about this result...<br>
But, your strength is undeniable, heh. Essex, you've really grown a lot.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Essex：</span><br>
...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
Essex? What's the matter?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Essex：</span><br>
(mutters) This... isn't the result I wanted...<br>
Sorry, I'm a bit worn out... I'm going to head back to rest first.<br>
<br>
Essex seemed to be acting strangely.<br>

Enterprise Troubles<br>
<br>
Chapter 5: Knots of the Heart, Pt. 1<br>
Port - Office<br>
Ever since the training exercise, Essex hadn't quite been herself.<br>
Perhaps it was time to do something about this...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Essex：</span><br>
Huh? You'd like to take me somewhere to thank me for my service?<br>
I'm just doing my job as secretary... there's no need to go out of the way to thank me...<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Ask her earnestly</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Essex：</span><br>
F-fine, since you're being so insistent...<br>
<br>
On our next day off, I took Essex into town not far from the port.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Essex：</span><br>
This doesn't feel much different from our usual patrols, just in a different location.<br>
Ah, surely you have some specific instructions in mind?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："How do you feel about Enterprise?"</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Essex：</span><br>
How I feel about Enterprise...<br>
Well, she's the legendary hero of the Eagle Union, after all. Everyone admires and respects her, and she's my role model.<br>
Even though everyone has always had high expectations for the Essex-class, our specifications are just numbers compared to Enterprise's countless battles.<br>
That's why I've always wanted to beat her - to prove my own worth and finally gain recognition.<br>
Though I managed to fight her to a draw during the mock battle, I still feel unsatisfied...<br>
Surely she was holding back because she still saw me as her junior and didn't want to hurt my pride.<br>
I'm not strong enough to earn the recognition of the others, after all...<br>
Mhm, that settles it! I'll just have to train harder when we get back!<br>
Then, one day, I'll pass up Enterprise and earn her - no, everyone's recognition...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
You're wrong about that.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Essex：</span><br>
E-Enterprise?!<br>

Enterprise Troubles<br>
<br>
Chapter 6: Knots of the Heart, Pt. 2<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
When you have these kinds of thoughts, you've already let your doubts get the better of you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Essex：</span><br>
W-why are you here, Enterprise?<br>
Commander... is this your doing?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
Indeed. Commander was concerned about the way you were behaving, so we came together.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Essex：</span><br>
Ugh...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
Whether in practice or in live combat, I always give it my all. That is a basic courtesy owed to all opponents.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Essex：</span><br>
Enterprise...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
Your growth has been evident to all of us. You could say that the result of the mock battle was within expectations.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Essex：</span><br>
B-but...!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
Let me pose you a question. Are you planning to renounce all the hard work you put in by telling yourself that I didn't try my hardest?<br>
Will your burning desire to beat me be quelled with this single draw?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Essex：</span><br>
Of course not!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
I already know. Remember, true strength does not come from the recognition of others, nor is it a marker on the side of the road for you to pass. True strength is in its pursuit, for your own sake.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Essex：</span><br>
For my own sake...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
Essex, I consider you one of my esteemed mentees, as well as one of my few rivals.<br>
But the person you must overcome is not me, or anyone else. Rather, it is yourself.<br>
Have more confidence in yourself. You still have a lot of untapped potential within you.<br>
Wouldn't you agree, Commander?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Acknowledge Essex's potential</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Essex：</span><br>
Commander...<br>
I understand now. Thank you again, Enterprise. Without your guidance, I surely would have continued to lose myself.<br>
Commander, thank you as well.<br>
However, I still haven't given up on my goal of beating you, Enterprise!<br>
"I'm not gonna lose to you again!" ... and I'll prove it before that lucky crane does!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
Heh. I'll be looking forward to that day.<br>
<br>
Essex's smile seemed gentler than usual. The knot in her heart seemed to finally be dissolving.<br>

Chapter 7: When We're Together<br>
Port - Office<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Essex：</span><br>
Commander, I've already confirmed the furniture purchase order. All I need now is your seal of approval.<br>
The research lab's expenses have been compiled? I'd like to check it against the list we have here, but...<br>
<br>
Although managing a fleet is quite complicated, many tasks have become much simpler thanks to Essex's assistance.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Essex：</span><br>
All right! We're in a great condition today!<br>
... Ah, someone's at the door! Come on in, it's unlocked!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
Pardon me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Essex：</span><br>
Enterprise! Do you need anything?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
Can you show me yesterday's commission logs? There's something I wanted to confirm.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Essex：</span><br>
Give me just a moment. Commander, the log should be in that stack by your hand.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Pass the papers to Enterprise.</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
Appreciate it.<br>
Essex, you seem to have changed. Your synergy with Commander has improved as well.<br>
Anyway, I'll be heading out now.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Essex：</span><br>
I've changed...?<br>
It's probably because of how much time I've spent with you, Commander. Since becoming secretary, I've learned a lot of things not just about myself, but also about how to deal with others.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：I feel the same way about you.</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Essex：</span><br>
Um, does that include, um...<br>
Our relationship...<br>
Actually, Commander...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
Sorry, I actually left something in here...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Essex：</span><br>
...!! (blushes profusely)<br>
Essex's expression was a strange mix of embarrassment and anger. Enterprise, who was in the process of pushing open the door, awkwardly stopped mid-way.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
Ah, um... I'm very sorry for the intrusion. I'll see you two later.<br>
<br>
Well, I guess stuff like this is bound to happen when we're together.<br>
