T=T-N<br>
My job-well-done reward from Tower expires, and I wake up to the warmth of gentle sunlight.<br>
It's just as she said – I've rewound to the morning of the day after I arrived at the Gate of Avalon.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
The date's correct... I'm back for real this time.<br>
I guess the next thing to do is "keep an eye out for news from the Sea of Stars."<br>
<br>
Based on Tower's obvious hints, Memphis' deliberate suspense, and what I saw and learned in that brighter world's Sea of Stars, a thought rises to my mind...<br>
That maybe Lexington's medical treatment really has made a breakthrough.<br>
But, unlike what happened in the brighter world, I think she's going to be caught in the eye of the storm along with the Sea of Stars.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
...I've got to go there at once.<br>
<br>
With a course of action in mind, I arranged a meeting with Elizabeth immediately, and asked her to charter a plane for Helena and me to the Sea of Stars.<br>
The META Elizabeth, who had now finished recovering, swiftly requested to come with us.<br>
One of Tower's goals in creating the brighter world was to give Elizabeth META enough time to heal and have her protect me when my time came to confront the next storm.<br>
As such, I had no reason to turn her down.<br>
In order for this Elizabeth to enter what is very much a top-secret Eagle Union base, she'd ordinarily need to go through a fairly lengthy review process.<br>
However, she told me that she had a unique method to meet me in the Galactic Core without formally entering the Sea of Stars.<br>
All it requires is for me to turn a blind eye to her blatant disregard of management regulations.<br>
The situation being what it was, I gave a nod to her proposal.<br>
Sometime later...<br>
Once my plane took off, I decided I'd use this time to look into something.<br>
Before Elizabeth and I parted ways, I told her and her attendants about the unbelievably long dream I had the night before.<br>
Their dreams were shockingly similar to mine. The complete victory over the Sirens, the successful reformation of the Azur Lane... Everything was exactly like I'd experienced in the brighter world.<br>
This spurred me to contact Richelieu and Bismarck, and conduct a wider investigation.<br>
After comparing our respective accounts, we concluded that there had indeed been an event known as a "collective dream" on a global scale. Seemingly not everyone in the world had been affected, however.<br>
More precisely, humanity hadn't been affected in the least – only shipgirls had. Furthermore, it was limited to only those who had been asleep between midnight and 7 AM.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
...Which lines up exactly with how long I slept.<br>
That means this collective dream began the moment I fell asleep, and ended as soon as I woke up.<br>
In theory, all of humanity should've been swept up in this collective dream that was essentially a possibility.<br>
If I had to guess, it's the Wisdom Cube network that's responsible for why only shipgirls who were asleep in this timeframe remember what happened.<br>
While I don't know the principle behind it, Tower was clearly not joking around...<br>
If I'd made the wrong choice, that brighter world wouldn't just have been a collective dream or a possibility.<br>
It would've become reality itself the instant that I made that critical decision.<br>
<br>
That thought sends chills down my spine. I decide to call Helena to hear her take on the subject and to calm myself down.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
Yeah... Right after I woke up, I remembered the dream vividly down to the details.<br>
But now, I've forgotten everything but the most memorable things, just like a regular dream.<br>
As strange a dream as it was, I didn't feel scared at all because everything that happened in it was good.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Alright, so what do you remember?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
A hot spring, a museum, a forest, a snowy mountain...<br>
I guess we went on loads and loads of vacations together. Heheh.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
You're right. I can hardly believe we went to so many places and relaxed for so long together while only a single night passed in reality.<br>
You know, if that kind of technology became widespread, everyone could get extra holidays when they sleep and come back to work rejuvenated.<br>
Heck... We might not even need holidays anymore with that!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
Shush, Commander!<br>

<br>
Eagle Union - Sea of Stars<br>
Accessway<br>
As I enter the accessway, I'm immediately greeted by Saratoga and Memphis, whom I'd contacted in advance.<br>
If they remember the events of the brighter world, then maybe...<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Do you have a "surprise" for me?</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
I mean, there IS a surprise, it's just not at the same level as the dream was.<br>
See, before you left the Sakura Empire, our researchers solved a problem that had plagued the team for months. By accident, too.<br>
Based on this, we managed to get the technology for a Type II Lexington-class rigging that's theoretically feasible and can probably even wake Lex up.<br>
And, umm, I swear I wasn't trying to keep you in the dark about it!<br>
It's just that it was only theoretical, so I first wanted to improve it and personally make sure it's safe before we started working on a rigging for Lex.<br>
Then, once all was said and done, we'd invite you over for a surprise! This way, we wouldn't get our hopes up for nothing.<br>
Anyway, I've sent you all the information. I can transfer authority over to you now if you wanna take over.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Absolutely. If I'm not mistaken, the Galactic Core can run simulations of rigging projections, right?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
Yep! We've been using it to fine-tune the details of the Type II for the past days.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
How far are you into the safety review for this technology?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
At the moment, all results point toward it being safe.<br>
Although, the fact that it wasn't mentioned at all in that brighter world does make me a little anxious...<br>
...Are you considering using what we have now directly on Lex?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
The brighter world was ultimately just one possibility. There's a new storm on the horizon, and we need to make decisions quickly before something else happens.<br>
But I digress. Can you show me to her?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Right! Come this way, Commander.<br>
<br>
Sea of Stars - Medical Bay "Dolphin" - Area U1M<br>
Upon entering Lexington's intensive care unit, I immediately feel a gust of cold air.<br>
At the center of the room stands her care pod, inside which she's soundly asleep.<br>
There are countless medical devices doing their tasks, all keeping the care pod running.<br>
The medical devices, in turn, are kept running by the cold temperature of the room.<br>
Despite all of my memories being intact, I seem to recall one of them very differently.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lexington：</span><br>
...I'm glad to be back, {playername} – my Commander...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
......<br>
<br>
I shake my head, brushing off the memories from the brighter world.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
...I need to push harder to make that scene a reality.<br>
(Elizabeth, do you copy?)<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
(We're all set. Take a breath and start the test.)<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(If anything goes wrong, you're my lifeline.)<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
(Rest assured.)<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Phew...<br>
TB, prepare for a test in the Galactic Core and get ready to move the care mod.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB ：</span><br>
Orders received.<br>
Confirmation: Commander, will you be partaking in the proceeding Type II rigging data overwrite test?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Yeah. I'll meet you in the Core.<br>
<br>
Sea of Stars - Galactic Core - Area X<br>
As the brains of the Sea of Stars, TB really is an expert at handling various tasks around its facilities.<br>
By the time I arrive at the Galactic Core, she has already finished setting up everything needed for the test.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB ：</span><br>
Beginning activation of the Galactic Core. Three...<br>
<br>
Lexington's care pod comes into view at such an angle that I see her smile when looking down.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB ：</span><br>
Two...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
It'll be fine... This is a simple verification test with no contact involved.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB ：</span><br>
One...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
If the work on your Type II is a success, we'll see each other again soon.<br>
<br>
After a brief flash of light, the world is suddenly enveloped in silence.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
...Huh? What's this? The Galactic Core doesn't seem to be working right.<br>
TB, do you hear me? What's going on?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB ：</span><br>
KRRSSHH... Ready... KRRSSHH... overwrite... KRRSSHH... test... KRRSSHH...<br>
<br>
KABOOOM!<br>
The space around me warps suddenly, and I can't hear TB's static-riddled voice anymore. At the same time, Lexington's care pod starts displaying abnormal values.<br>
A premonition within me grows and grows – that the "next episode" that Tower spoke of is about to begin.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
Don't worry, we're here with you.<br>
<br>
My field of view distorts horribly, and Elizabeth appears inside the space.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
How intriguing... This is not the Galactic Core. The two of you have been transported.<br>
This spatial distortion is caused by pressure generated while traversing the Singularity. Just keep an eye on the care pod while we work to stabilise the passage.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
The care pod? O–<br>
<br>
Hesitant, I turn my eyes back to the care pod. She is looking back at me from inside the glass.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
...Huh?<br>
<br>
KABOOOM!<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
External pressure is rising... Your spatial transfer has encountered some resistance.<br>
Servant, do you see anything unusual?!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Lexington! She's awake!<br>
Looks like the data overwriting process has started, too, but the pod is obstructing it!<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
Then wrench it open at once!<br>
She has no need for the pod anymore since she's already awake!<br>
We shall buy you some time! Hurry!<br>
<br>
KABOOOM!<br>
I rush through one security check after another, and then, space warps again as innumerable points of light appear out of thin air and converge around the care pod.<br>
The blinding light reaches its peak just as the pod opens.<br>
All of the light comes together into a cocoon.<br>
It envelops the pod, the Core of the Sea of Stars, and then the entire world.<br>
Finally, with a burst of blue flame...<br>
The Blue Ghost breaks through her cocoon.<br>

???<br>
Skyscrapers, rising tall like a forest of trees. Cars and people, going to and fro.<br>
A strangely familiar yet foreign scene leaps into my view as the light fades away.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
The city from the future... NY Harbor?<br>
<br>
The tension in my heart relaxes for a moment.<br>
It has to be said that this turn of events feels familiar.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Last time, it was in a simulation Helena ran using the Tower... Her goal was for us to get Yorktown's Type II rigging data.)<br>
(Could this be something similar?)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lexington II：</span><br>
...Huh?<br>
<br>
Just as I'm about to look around, I'm met with a puzzled look from a woman tilting her head.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lexington II：</span><br>
...Are we in NY Harbor?<br>
I'm... You're... And this gear, it's... Wait, what?!<br>
Did we... make it back?<br>
<br>
A realization seems to have hit her, her expression changes from confusion to joy, and she suddenly pulls me into a hug.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lexington II：</span><br>
...Commander!<br>
<br>
As she breaks down in tears, I hold her tightly in my arms.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lexington II：</span><br>
Thank god... It's really you...<br>
Finally... I finally get to see you again!<br>
I knew it back then – that you'd be arriving soon with reinforcements...<br>
I wanted to see you one more time...<br>
But it just wasn't possible...<br>
A Class IX would've been born if I'd just stood there...<br>
So I did what I had to...<br>
Say, was Helena saved? Are Sara and the others all okay?<br>
No, I'm sure they all are...<br>
After all, you managed to save even me...<br>
So, what was that strange care pod? Did you procure it for me?<br>
More importantly... How is the war going?<br>
Seeing how at peace NY Harbor is, I can only assume our coastal waters are as safe as can be, right?<br>
Hang on. Something's really not right here...<br>
We were in the base, weren't we? Why are we suddenly in the city?<br>
<br>
"Wait..."<br>
"There is a problem..."<br>
"A serious problem..."<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
...Lexington.<br>
What's the last thing you remember?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lexington II：</span><br>
Well... I sacrificed myself to stop the Class IX mimic beast from fully materializing.<br>
<br>
I have no idea what she's talking about.<br>
Actually, to put it more aptly, I have no idea what she's saying, and it's entirely because of what I saw in that recording Helena left for me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lexington II：</span><br>
What is the matter, Commander? You seem as confused as I am.<br>
<br>
She picks up on my confusion and the sense of distance between us.<br>
I want to reassure her, but my mind is a jumbled mess. I don't even know where to begin.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lexington II：</span><br>
Do you... not... remember me?<br>
<br>
Lexington, in her cleverness, immediately gets a broad idea of the situation from my hesitation.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lexington II：</span><br>
I see... You forgot everything.<br>
So this situation doesn't make sense to either one of us.<br>
I don't know how I'm alive, and you don't know why you've lost your memories.<br>
And that's not even mentioning the question of why we're in NY Harbor...<br>
Alright, what do you say we go and figure things out? Starting with your amnesia.<br>
If we take a walk around the city, you might remember something.<br>
Oh, wait, first I need to straighten my clothes, and put on new makeup.<br>
<br>
Not only has she instantly pulled herself together and analyzed the situation, but she has also given me a bit of reassurance.<br>
It's her. The Lexington I know. I'm sure of it beyond the shadow of a doubt.<br>
"However..."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lexington II：</span><br>
I'm ready now! Shall we set off, Commander?<br>
<br>
Although she puts on a smile, the faint trembling of her body betrays what's really on her mind.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
......<br>
<br>
The last thing I'd do is ignore her when she's like this.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Okay. Let's get going.</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：Yeah. Let's set off.</span>'''''<br>

Clouds of smoke still hung in the air, their embers still burning.<br>
As the light faded, an ocean in flames came into Elizabeth META's view.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
...What is this?<br>
Someone transported those two... right under our nose?<br>
No, they weren't the only ones... We got warped to another location as well, it seems.<br>
Hmph... It seems we and the servant alike have fallen for someone's trap.<br>
Is this what she was referring to when she said "the next episode"?<br>
We're certain that Lexington did wake up while inside the care pod...<br>
Meaning, whatever's happening now likely has something to do with Helena's plan.<br>
Yes. That makes sense. The Sea of Stars is practically her own backyard, after all.<br>
That being the case, we at least need not worry about our servant's well-being.<br>
That said...<br>
We entered the Sea of Stars to ensure our servant's safety, and then stabilised the passageway... Therefore, the two were able to leave safely.<br>
This was surely a part of her plan. Our recovery was essential to it, even.<br>
Perhaps Tower's actions were indeed meant to fill a hole in said plan.<br>
However, for what reason were we sent here, then?<br>
Was it so we could no longer interfere, our purpose having been served?<br>
Or is it because there is something here that she wants us to do?<br>
Ah, no matter. Standing here and thinking all day won't do us any good.<br>
Judging by the density of these coordinates, this world is quite a fascinating place...<br>
To start with, we should head to the nearest large city.<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=Mass Syncope|选项=5|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<br>
Pushing back the doubts in my mind, I went with Lexington on a railcar and headed for the city's central shopping area.<br>
On the way there, I was shocked by what I saw.<br>
I'd never seen NY Harbor this prosperous before, be it in a recording or a simulation or anything.<br>
What's more, it seemed that Helena's script (if there is one) did not have a next step until we arrived at our destination.<br>
There were no sudden phone calls, no chance encounters, nothing at all other than being with Lexington.<br>
She and I silently blended in with the city, like raindrops falling in an ocean.<br>
Later, after strolling around the area for a while...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lexington II：</span><br>
Commander, look. These top articles sound a bit odd.<br>
<br>
Lexington had bought a tablet while I wasn't looking. She shows me the news on it.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
"Another Mass Syncope Incident"... "The Second Mass Syncope"...<br>
It just keeps going... This "mass syncope incident" seems to be all they talk about.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lexington II：</span><br>
Do you remember the first one that happened?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
The first one?<br>
<br>
In an instant, I catch a small glimmer of light in the ocean of my thoughts.<br>
......<br>
...A phenomenon known as "Mass Syncope" has been having a profound impact around the world.<br>
This global outbreak began following the events of the Second Samos Standoff.<br>
While most affected patients have recovered with medical intervention, everyone affected by it claims to have lived through a five-year war while comatose.<br>
In reality, the conflict between the Revolutionary Front and Oceanic Federation did not escalate, resulting in no World War ■■■ breaking out.<br>
However, despite this, the recollections of Syncope sufferers all corroborate each other.<br>
Furthermore, by organizing the accounts of a large number of patients, we can reconstruct the full picture of what happened during this "World War."<br>
......<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
...I remember now. You mean the collective dream that people had of a World War?<br>
(That sounds really similar to the after-effects of Tower's brighter world...)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lexington II：</span><br>
Yes, that! Are your memories returning to you?!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I feel like... I've started remembering things little by little since we entered the city.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lexington II：</span><br>
Wonderful! That's wonderful news.<br>
<br>
She flashes a heartfelt smile one moment, only for her expression to turn serious the next moment.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lexington II：</span><br>
In that case... The situation we're in might be more puzzling than I thought.<br>
Did you see what date it is on the screen?<br>
We're back to before the Richard Incident took place.<br>
Isn't it bizarre that there's knowledge on the Second Samos Standoff and the First Mass Syncope before the Richard Incident has even happened?<br>
Also, look at this. The Council says this incident is under investigation.<br>
The Council is an organization that was established to consolidate all of humanity's resources against the X. How come it exists already?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Maybe this world's history just differs from ours.<br>
If we find what caused the divergence, we might be able to make better sense of this situation.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lexington II：</span><br>
Yes. A keen observation.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I say we try getting in touch with the Council directly.<br>
Do you know Anzeel's or Aoste's contact information?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lexington II：</span><br>
Of course I do. Just a moment.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Communicator：</span><br>
BEEP BEEP!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lexington II：</span><br>
What? It said "this number is not in use."<br>
I suppose they must use different numbers at the moment.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Yeah, I thought it wouldn't be that easy.<br>
At least we have a lead now. We just have to follow it to its end.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lexington II：</span><br>
Heehee. I knew you'd say that.<br>
"Since it's come to this, let's go grab a bite to eat first."<br>
<br>
All of a sudden, she straightens herself and adopts a different demeanor.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Was she imitating me just now?)<br>
(She's surprisingly... on point.)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lexington II：</span><br>
Well, what restaurant should we go to?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Hmm. Let me think...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lexington：</span><br>
Sara told me that a Dragon Empery restaurant has gotten popular in the central area.<br>
I think it's called "Yunxiang Sanwei."<br>
Shall we go there tomorrow after class?<br>
<br>
I pluck out another glimmer of light from the ocean of my thoughts.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername} & Lexington II：</span><br>
- How about Yunxiang Sanwei?  - Maybe Yunxiang Sanwei?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lexington II：</span><br>
Seems we have the same idea!<br>
I'll go ahead and book a table.<br>

<br>
Queen Elizabeth META boarded the Queen's Light and examined her surroundings.<br>
She found that she was in the Gulf of Alaska of this test site, and so made her way to the nearest big city, which was Anchorage.<br>
En route there, she spotted a fleet local to this test site, also on its way to Anchorage, and this sparked her curiosity.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cowpens：</span><br>
Attention, everyone: We have entered the Gulf of Alaska and are now under the control of Alaska Command.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pasadena：</span><br>
Nice, nice! I can't wait to meet those mysterious guests soon!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">William D. Porter：</span><br>
Heehee – I'm thinking we should give 'em a surprise of some sort!<br>
I've already got a few ideas, in fact!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Clarence K. Bronson：</span><br>
Please. This is Hornet's older sister we're talking about.<br>
She could singlehandedly match half of the Council's fleet. Specifically, the half with War Protocols in it.<br>
That's why they sent us with the full 7th Task Force to provide support.<br>
If you have ideas, then good luck to you. All I'm concerned with is the new gear.<br>
I'd love to test it out...<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Dewey META：</span><br>
Don't let your guards down just yet, please. We still haven't entered a safe sector.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Cleveland META：</span><br>
C'mon, Dewey, you're just overly cautious.<br>
This place is nowhere near the front line, and even the occasional enemy that shows up ain't no big deal.<br>
We even took down that mimic entity earlier without breaking a sweat.<br>
You're a member of the 7th Task Force! Have some confidence in yourself!<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Dewey META：</span><br>
You're right... I'll try to keep up with the rest of you!<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
Hm?<br>
A Council Fleet? War Protocols? Even mimic entities?<br>
How could that be? Did we get sent back to the alpha timeline or something?<br>
That place should've been decimated long ago...<br>
Such a thing should be impossible even in theory.<br>
Good lord – what if this is a test site with a Siren-made simulation of the alpha timeline?<br>
That would be sheer madness...<br>
Oh no! We must talk to those girls at once!<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Dewey META：</span><br>
Watch out! A long object is approaching us from above at high speed!<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Cleveland META：</span><br>
Wait, fast and from above?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cowpens：</span><br>
If my recon plane isn't mistaken, I think... it's a train?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
Ladies of the Council's 7th Task Force, it's a pleasure to meet you! We are Queen Elizabeth META!<br>
We are the third of the mysterious guests you're going to meet!<br>

<br>
The atmosphere inside Yunxiang Sanwei is graceful and refined, and its food is exceptional.<br>
As the flavors unravel on my tongue, I feel that I've closed the distance to this world by another step.<br>
Lexington is also thoroughly relaxed. She looked more like how I remembered her.<br>
This city, with its foreign yet familiar vibe and its people... It feels fantastical like a dream, and a sense that none of this is real hangs over it.<br>
And yet, all the information my body has taken in – from the things my eyes have seen, to the stuff my ears have heard – they speak of veritable truth.<br>
This intense clash between reality and unreality has left me dumbfounded.<br>
It's a sensation akin to being inside an overexposed photograph...<br>
It's like it's not the world that there's something wrong with – it's me, trying to interpret it.<br>
As I soak in these outlandish thoughts, time ticks away slowly.<br>
Lexington and I finish our meal, and we get down to the next order of business.<br>
Since we've decided to stay here for a while to investigate, we need a place to call our base.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lexington II：</span><br>
If the date is what I believe it is, there should be an apartment in the central area under my name.<br>
Shall we go there first and check it out?<br>
<br>
We get in a taxi. Through the windows, I continue carefully observing the scenery of this futuristic city.<br>
I keep my eyes peeled throughout the journey, looking for anything out of place.<br>
For instance, pedestrians moving unnaturally, buildings that look hazy, inconsistencies in regional changes, or invisible walls you cannot pass through.<br>
Whether it's the Sea of Stars or the Tower running this simulation, my prior experience shows that you'll find uncanny things hiding in the details if you look closely enough.<br>
This time, however, I couldn't find a single thing that looked wrong.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(...Is that even possible?)<br>
(A simulated world with nothing wrong about it?)<br>
(Did we... actually end up in some unique test site?)<br>
<br>
With several theories in my mind, Lexington and I arrive at the building where she should be living.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lexington II：</span><br>
It says "apartment for rent"...<br>
*sigh*... I suppose I should've known the finer details of this world wouldn't be like I remember.<br>
Of course the apartment I should own isn't the same...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Damn. Even the little things differ. Should we try our luck with a hotel?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lexington II：</span><br>
We don't need to. Just give me a minute.<br>
<br>
She takes out the tablet she bought on our way here and starts tapping and swiping on it swiftly.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lexington II：</span><br>
It IS there! I still have all the money I used to buy the apartment.<br>
In fact... I have MORE than I did then!<br>
Lucky us! I'll purchase it right now.<br>
There! Our little problem is solved.<br>
<br>
With a cheerful electronic sound, the door to the luxurious apartment in front of us opens.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Uh... Excuse me?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lexington II：</span><br>
I bought the apartment, silly! It's much more comfortable to stay in your own home than in a hotel room.<br>
<br>
She just bought a luxury apartment in under a minute, a fact that both impresses me and gives me a new image of this futuristic city.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lexington II：</span><br>
Well? Shall we go in?<br>
<br>
The instant I touch the door, I seize yet another spark of light from within the rushing currents.<br>
Inside a room in a warm apartment, a lively party is taking place.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
Congrats on your move, Sis!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bon Homme Richard：</span><br>
Congratulations, Lexington!<br>
Y'know, you buying this apartment represents a huge legal breakthrough for shipgirls owning real estate!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lexington：</span><br>
I never expected the approval process to go so smoothly.<br>
Of course, I couldn't have done it without all of you supporting me!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bon Homme Richard：</span><br>
Well, believe me, we're just getting started here.<br>
We live in a period of rapid change, and our future is only gonna get better from here!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(That must've been... from when Lexington first moved in.)<br>
(Bon Homme Richard was there, among the people who came to congratulate her.)<br>
(That's the first time she's shown up in my memories...)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lexington II：</span><br>
Hm? Something the matter, Commander?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Oh, it's nothing. Seeing your apartment just made me remember something again.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lexington II：</span><br>
Oh! Really?! Then take it nice and slow. I can stay right here, if you want.<br>
Who knows – maybe another memory will come back to you?<br>
<br>
She simply stands next to me, doing nothing but staring ahead.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Ahaha... I've already remembered most of it. Let's go in.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lexington II：</span><br>
Well, alright.<br>

<br>
Queen Elizabeth META made the right call by introducing herself along with the Queen's Light.<br>
Because, while the members of the Council's fleet had already seen most of the world's cutting-edge technologies...<br>
When they saw her "old-school" train soaring through the sky at speeds even higher than their latest aircraft, they could do nothing but stare with slack jaws.<br>
This also made her identity as a "mysterious guest" as clear as day.<br>
Thus, under the motive of meeting up with the other mysterious guests, she joined the Council's fleet and headed toward their destination of Anchorage.<br>
It was nearing winter, and sunsets in Alaska always came early in the day.<br>
They arrived in Anchorage by the evening, at which point the skies overhead had already gone completely dark.<br>
There, unfolding before Elizabeth's eyes, was a massive metropolis enveloped in colorful neon.<br>
Contrary to the small town she had envisioned, its prosperity was unlike anything she had seen in any other test site.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
(Rows upon rows of skyscrapers, a dense industrial area, a coastal defense system stretching on forever... There's even a fleet of floating battleships attached.)<br>
(What is this? Is this place truly the city of Anchorage?)<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Cleveland META：</span><br>
Whew. Elizabeth, we're here.<br>
We'll be heading to the naval station now, so you should stick close.<br>
Once you get through the formalities, we'll lead you to the other two mysterious guests!<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
There'll be no need for that. They're already there.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Cleveland META：</span><br>
Say what? Where? I don't see 'em anywhere.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
(...She's with the Council, but her technology is incapable of detecting the Ashes – who should be their allies?)<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Dewey META：</span><br>
Oh... Hornet sent me a message saying she's coming to meet us with Enterprise and Essex META.<br>
She says not to enter the harbor, but rather to go to a designated area and wait.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cowpens：</span><br>
She's coming to meet us? I believe that goes against our proper procedures.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pasadena：</span><br>
Sounds to me like the other two mysterious guests WANT to come and meet us.<br>
Reckon just the two of them could rival half of the Council's fleet?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
(Enterprise alone could devastate your entire fleet with only a half-arsed attempt...)<br>
(We are already concealing our full power. The Ashes do so to an even greater extent.)<br>
(That being said, this test site must be hiding some great secret if that Enterprise considers it worthwhile to stay here. Things are getting increasingly interesting...)<br>
(...There they are. We'd better go and make their acquaintance.)<br>
<br>
Sometime later,<br>
at the designated area in nearby waters,<br>
all the members of the 7th Task Force rendezvoused.<br>
For Elizabeth, this was her first meeting with the leader of the Ashes.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Enterprise META：</span><br>
You're not her. Who are you?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
Well, good day to you too, Enterprise of the Ashes.<br>
Indeed, we are not "her," and we've never entered the resculpting stage. Thus, we have to go great lengths to gather intel from all over the place.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Enterprise META：</span><br>
"Never entered the resculpting stage," huh... Okay.<br>
What are you here for?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
What if we told you that we simply got caught up in Helena's plan?<br>
Actually, what are YOU lot doing here?<br>
You must have noticed how strange this place is. HOW did you even get here?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Enterprise META：</span><br>
A Council beacon, but by the look of things, I'll bet that was also Helena's handiwork.<br>
I understand now.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
Understand what, pray tell?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Enterprise META：</span><br>
You don't need to know.<br>
You're not her, and you haven't even reached the resculpting stage. This is none of your business.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
Excuse us? We're here, right in this world. How is this "none of our business"?<br>
Never mind. Since you don't wish to say, we'll just find out on our own.<br>
Begin examination.<br>
What? There's... nothing?<br>
Our examination doesn't work on you?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Enterprise META：</span><br>
No.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
Well, then...<br>
PUZPNOA (Insight!)<br>
...That neither?<br>
Not even insight works on you?<br>
What makes you... so unique?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Enterprise META：</span><br>
......<br>
I wish I knew.<br>
I've been like this ever since that day...<br>
Okay, Queen Elizabeth. We've talked enough.<br>
Those people are gushing with curiosity for you. If it's intel you're looking for, go speak to them.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Hornet META：</span><br>
...A really long, really fast, and really old-school train?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pasadena：</span><br>
Yeah! I'm telling you, we saw it with our own eyes!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cowpens：</span><br>
Yes. It went even faster than my aircraft. It was truly a sight to behold.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Clarence K. Bronson：</span><br>
How I'd love to study its interior...<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Dewey META：</span><br>
Um... I'm also really curious about it. We should definitely ask Elizabeth about it later.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">William D. Porter：</span><br>
Wish she'd wrap things up over there already. Come on, hurry uuup!<br>
Oh, seems she's done. She's looking at us!<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
(She has a point... We should connect more with the locals and gather some useful information.)<br>

<br>
Throughout the day, groceries and daily necessities that Lexington had ordered online began to arrive. Bit by bit, the apartment was given touches of life.<br>
She let a robot called the RELAX-365 All-Purpose Chorebot care for the place while she went into the kitchen.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lexington II：</span><br>
Alas, robots still can't do the cooking for us. I guess I'll just have to treat you to my own home cooking!<br>
<br>
While she worked in the kitchen, I turned on the television and changed the channel to an evening news program.<br>
Most of the news coverage revolved around the Second Mass Syncope.<br>
This one had affected not just the Eagle Union, but the entire world at large.<br>
All of humanity exhibited symptoms, too, instead of just shipgirls – though they weren't affected for as long.<br>
This differed from Tower's brighter world, but it was similar to the First Mass Syncope.<br>
I say "similar" because it wasn't just for five years in this case.<br>
It had lasted multiple decades, stretching from the Richard Incident to the Final Magistration.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
All of the alpha timeline was a collective dream here.<br>
And this world must be another possible fate for the alpha timeline... One that came after averting so many catastrophes.<br>
<br>
Apart from the faintings, one other new item grabs my attention.<br>
The Anchorage National Observatory in Alaska is hosting a gathering of hobbyist astronomers, and the local government is preparing a major event to attract tourists.<br>
That would be mundane news on its own, but what strikes me is that it's being reported on alongside such a worldwide phenomenon.<br>
The incongruity only piques my interest further.<br>
Time passes slowly as I catch up with the news...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lexington II：</span><br>
Well? What do you think?<br>
<br>
Before I know it, Lexington has finished preparing a luxurious meal.<br>
Every dish is divided into small portions. It's such a vast array of foods that I don't even recognize some of them.<br>
All of it is so delicious that I can't stop myself from sampling every bit of it.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Wait a second...)<br>
Are these all dishes that the past me used to love?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lexington II：</span><br>
Aww, was it that easy to tell?<br>
The sense of taste can bring back old memories. I thought that I might be able to help you remember everything.<br>
Do you feel anything coming to the surface at all?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Hmm... Nothing except the realization that this is the best meal I've had all year.<br>
It's so delicious that I can't resist eating more and more.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lexington II：</span><br>
Heehee! Thank you for the compliments, Commander.<br>
I'd be happy to cook different dishes for you every day.<br>
By the way, do you have plans tomorrow?<br>
Now that I've bought this apartment, I'll still need to re-order all of that custom-made furniture I had.<br>
We'd better go pick out bedding at the store tomorrow, and then we'll need clothes...<br>
It's going to be a big shopping day for us!<br>
<br>
Now that she's back in a familiar environment, Lexington has made herself right at home.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
What about the investigation?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lexington II：</span><br>
Hmm... Is there any reason we can't just wait for the Council's findings?<br>
In a way, isn't this world like a beautiful little dream?<br>
We can't contact anybody, and they can't contact us, either.<br>
In other words... There's no real reason to worry about anything, is there?<br>
Would it be so wrong to just relax for a few days?<br>
Even after we wake up, it won't change the fact that we've experienced this together.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
......<br>
If this really is just a dream, then sure.<br>
But I think it's become clear that this is no mere dream.<br>
Let me tell you a story, Lexington.<br>
<br>
I told her the story of the Siren invasion, the Azur Lane, and its Commander.<br>
After listening to all of it, she thought deeply for a while. As it turned out, this story was nothing like the version of events that she knew.<br>
She told me her story, too.<br>
Her story's Commander had several other titles as well – general, politician, businessperson, teacher, assistant, and more.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lexington II：</span><br>
In this world, our stories are just stories. They're not real.<br>
Do you think... the stories we know could just be dreams brought on by mass delusions, too?<br>
What if all of our sadness and all of our losses... were just a dream?<br>
What if the world we're in now is the real one, after all?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I can tell that you won't be convinced that easily, and neither will I.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lexington II：</span><br>
*sigh*... Things have gotten so complicated.<br>
What's real, and what's fake? We'll never know until the very end.<br>
If this is what it's come to, then why don't we go with your old approach?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
...Old approach?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lexington II：</span><br>
You'd always say "one step at a time." Instead of fretting about the future, we have to take that first step.<br>
Even if you don't remember me now, I only need to take that first step... to make you love me again...<br>
<br>
She murmurs to herself quietly, but I hear every word of it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lexington II：</span><br>
In that case, shall we start investigating bright and early tomorrow?<br>
Our communications might be down, but as long as someone is in this world, we'll find a way to get in contact.<br>
For example... We could start with the Naval Department?<br>
Things aren't what I remember, but I should still have my authority.<br>
Nobody can stop me from going there to search for whoever I want.<br>
<br>
Lexington refocuses herself and proposes a plan that satisfies my wants.<br>
The investigation might shatter this sweet illusion, but she sides with me and tries to help without hesitation.<br>
Despite the fact that this is the dream that brought her and all she loves back to life...<br>
A torrent of memories surges up within me.<br>
In a messy apartment, Lexington sits alone on the floor.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lexington：</span><br>
Ah... Why are you here, too?<br>
It's okay. Even after what Richard did...<br>
I know that you did everything you could...<br>
It's just retiring me from service, relieving me of my rigging, and installing a limiter to my Wisdom Cube...<br>
Frankly, it's much better than the worst case I was expecting.<br>
I guess I'd better get ready to move out...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
......<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lexington II：</span><br>
Commandeeer, are you listening? Do you like my plan?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Umm... Well, I guess it isn't so urgent that we have to rush things.<br>
If we barged in and caused a serious commotion, things could take a turn for the worse.<br>
Let's do this one step at a time, after all. Bit by bit.<br>
That also means we'll need a stable and comfortable base of operations.<br>
Say... Could I ask you to plan our whole shopping trip tomorrow?<br>
Do you have what it takes, Master Lexington?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lexington II：</span><br>
...I think I just might! I'll go make a plan right away, and it'll knock your socks off!<br>

<br>
Following a stubborn negotiation headed by William D. Porter, Queen Elizabeth META allowed the members of the 7th Task Force to come aboard the Queen's Light.<br>
While they cheered and rejoiced, Elizabeth took the opportunity to do a full scan on them.<br>
The result gave her quite a shock.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
...They don't have safety devices?!<br>
Why does not a single one of them have a limiter on their Wisdom Cubes?!<br>
Even WE initially had a limiter on ours!<br>
This is preposterous... Wisdom Cubes should always have a limiter on them in the Sirens' test sites!<br>
This is a part of the fundamental logic in every Siren mainframe we've seen thus far... This fact has been true of every test site we've come across.<br>
No, wait... It's possible that we've made a massive assumption!<br>
These limiters have only been observed in test sites overseen by the Sirens' experimentation division...<br>
Meaning, their test sites always have limiters imposed for safety... But what if this site is not overseen by them?<br>
This test site isn't necessarily beholden to that logic if it was created by... the Arbiters.<br>
Yes, of course... It explains how they possess such advanced technology, even capable of simulating the alpha timeline.<br>
That's it. The experimentation division do not have a hand in this test site...<br>
It's managed by the Arbiters themselves!<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Hornet META：</span><br>
Elizabeth...<br>
Elizabeth? Hello?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
Oh. Are you done with the tour?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Hornet META：</span><br>
Yep! Thanks a bunch for letting us check out your train!<br>
I, uh, heard from Enty that not everyone who's META is on the same level as the next one.<br>
You know, like how she and I are different, or how you and I are.<br>
You've got loads of powers beyond even our wildest imaginations, and all that. That's why I wanna learn from you!<br>
I wanna get stronger! A lot stronger!<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
How much do you know about Enterprise?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Hornet META：</span><br>
I know she came from far, far away, and that she also serves the Council, but that's about it.<br>
Well, she does not work for any Task Force, but for a separate organization called the Ashes. She wouldn't tell me anything besides that.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
Alright, and how much do you know about this world?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Hornet META：</span><br>
Uh, you mean our own world?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
Yes. What do you think of the Antiochus?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Hornet META：</span><br>
I mean, they're AI-powered weapons we made. Pretty sure the latest models are from the War Protocol series.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
Is that so?<br>
It's near impossible for you to become as strong as them.<br>
They are wholly unique, and the reason for their uniqueness is a question that no one can answer anymore.<br>
That being said, you can surely get a little stronger.<br>
What you have inside you is boundless potential. In fact, allow us to verify it for you.<br>
Begin examination.<br>
<br>
In that instant, time stopped.<br>
All the surroundings expanded in different directions, forming countless overlapping images.<br>
Countless "moments" intertwined and transformed, laying bare every little detail.<br>
And yet...<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
What's this? A boundary line?<br>
Beyond the sky, past this world... there exists a boundary line?<br>
It looks like... a veil.<br>
What exactly is that Veil?<br>

<br>
Even news that stirs the public is here today, gone tomorrow.<br>
Yesterday, by the time Lexington and I were heading to the shopping district, the Second Mass Syncope had already become a topic of the past.<br>
Today, the thing on all the people's lips is Bon Homme Richard's new movie.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(...She's making another one?)<br>
(Last time, it was The Final Countdown. What will it be this time?)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lexington II：</span><br>
Oh... "Frequency"?<br>
<br>
A giant electronic billboard appears before us, and displays a synopsis of the movie.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
...The story of a young girl who uses a spacetime anomaly caused by a sunspot to save her dead family and help solve a cold case. Huh.<br>
That solar spacetime anomaly sounds interesting.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lexington II：</span><br>
It does. I don't remember her ever shooting a movie like this, though.<br>
I suppose that's just another thing that's different in this world.<br>
They're showing the movie in 10 days. Shall we go see it once it releases?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
10 days...<br>
Yeah, sure. Let's watch it if we find the time.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lexington II：</span><br>
Great! Now, should we start on our main task for today?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Main task? You mean shopping?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lexington II：</span><br>
Heheh – it's not just shopping, it's a date!<br>
<br>
Lexington and I reveled in the enthusiasm and bustle of the giant city that is NY Harbor. Before we knew it, night had fallen.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lexington II：</span><br>
Whew! Nothing beats shopping for releasing a bit of stress.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Yeah, true. It's a good thing you've got all that storage space in your rigging.<br>
<br>
This day certainly reminded me of how to correctly use a rigging's storage space in everyday life.<br>
We bought so much stuff, I fear there's a risk that it won't all fit inside her home once we take it out.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lexington II：</span><br>
What do you say we have dinner at home?<br>
It's a date, and I want to impress you with my home cooking.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Yeah. I can't wait to try it.</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：Your cooking is as good as any five-star chef's.</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lexington II：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Heehee. You won't be disappointed!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lexington II：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Of course! Look forward to it.<br>
<br>
After we have a delicious meal and leave the cleanup to the Chorebot, Lexington starts leisurely tapping away at her tablet.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lexington II：</span><br>
Commander, I found it!<br>
Look! Dr. Anzeel and Dr. Aoste are going to visit the Anchorage National Observatory in Alaska in a few days.<br>
It also looks like other Council members will be going there for their own reasons.<br>
There must be something big happening then!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
The Anchorage National Observatory... Is it some event for astronomy enthusiasts?<br>
No wonder I felt something was off when I saw this news a few days ago – something big was on the horizon.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lexington II：</span><br>
We should hurry on over to Anchorage so we can meet the two doctors!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Absolutely. Just wondering, how'd you find the Council members' schedules? That should be classified info.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lexington II：</span><br>
I checked the logs on TORCH's servers.<br>
Despite the fact that the servers shouldn't exist at this point in time, I tried accessing them and managed to log in. As it turns out, my account permissions haven't changed!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Wait, "TORCH's servers"?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lexington II：</span><br>
The servers of the Threat Object Research and Control Headquarters! Our top secret organization, you know?<br>
The organization that Enterprise started, Flare, is in inspired by this name.<br>
Anyway, I'll book us some tickets. How about we set off tomorrow?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Tomorrow? Do we need to rush?<br>
Can't we go once we've thoroughly prepared? We need to buy travel items and stuff like that anyway.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lexington II：</span><br>
One day will be plenty of time to prepare.<br>
Besides, we'll have time on the way there.<br>
Once we arrive in Anchorage, there'll be local festivals and such to do, so we still have a few days until the big event!<br>
Also, I already bought everything we'll need earlier today. Did you not notice that?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
......<br>
First, let's take a plane over to Seattle, then we'll go to Anchorage by cruise ship.<br>
Since we're going on a journey, we might as well enjoy the scenery along the way.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lexington II：</span><br>
Okay! Let's do that.<br>

<br>
KABOOOM!<br>
The corrosion phenomenon began to rapidly shrink in size under the 7th Task Force's coordinated assault.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
Quite impressive. You're making light work of this thing.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Enterprise META：</span><br>
...They can only use their floating battleships and unmanned combat groups. They haven't even unlocked the War Protocols' weaponry yet.<br>
It's a husk of a Council Task Force. It doesn't hold a candle to the real deal.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
Pardon? Is a true Task Force really that powerful?<br>
More powerful than you, even?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Enterprise META：</span><br>
Powerful enough to bring you down, at least.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
Hmph. Not a joke we take in good humour.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Enterprise META：</span><br>
Why don't we give it a shot? I'll give you a fair assessment.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
Well, how about you go first? Then we shall assess the difference in strength between you and these girls.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Enterprise META：</span><br>
There won't be anything left for you if you pit me against these small fry.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
Then so be it. There will always be another time.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Essex META：</span><br>
*sigh*... So much talking.<br>
I'll do it.<br>
<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cowpens：</span><br>
Dewey, I've finished reconning the area. I'm synchronizing the data now.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Dewey META：</span><br>
Data received. Beginning analysis.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">War Protocol Moon：</span><br>
Border of corroded area detected. Area analysis complete.<br>
Weak spot of corroded area detected. Strike routes have been assigned.<br>
Marking high-priority targets. Assigning mission objectives.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Clarence K. Bronson：</span><br>
This is our order of engagement.<br>
First, we analyze the area, then use drones to incrementally seize control and clean up while the shipgirls directly deal with the priority threats.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">William D. Porter：</span><br>
This corrosion phenomenon's nothing! It'll be a walk in the park for us to take head-on!<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Hornet META：</span><br>
Since our targets have been assigned, I'm gonna lead the charge!<br>
<br>
<br>
Having discovered the existence of the Veil with her power of examination, Queen Elizabeth META didn't go a step further and use her insight. She went easy on herself, as she had only just recovered.<br>
Following this, she invited Hornet META and her companions to a training site to provide tactical guidance on their combat capabilities.<br>
That is, until the 7th Task Force received an order to sortie from War Protocol Moon.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">War Protocol Moon：</span><br>
I have received an emergency alert from the front lines.<br>
A corrosion phenomenon has occurred within the jurisdictional area of Alaska Command, accompanied by a localized spacetime anomaly of unknown origin.<br>
As the fleet stationed there, the 7th Task Force is to head to the site immediately, eliminate the corrosion phenomenon, and determine the cause of the spacetime anomaly.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Cleveland META：</span><br>
Hm? Corrosion's shown up? Aw, crap! We've gotta hurry, folks!<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Hornet META：</span><br>
Sorry, Elizabeth, we just got tasked with an urgent mission. We'll continue this some other time!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">William D. Porter：</span><br>
Hang on a sec... There's no rule against other shipgirls coming along with us on a mission, is there?<br>
And, and! Elizabeth should really see the corrosion phenomenon for herself to get a better understanding of our world, am I right?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pasadena：</span><br>
Yeah, totes! You'll come with us, won't you, Lizzy?!<br>
I wanna see how you fight!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Clarence K. Bronson：</span><br>
I concur! Bring your train, too!<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Enterprise META：</span><br>
I'm also interested in seeing your fighting style. Will you come with us?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Essex META：</span><br>
...Please?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
Well, if you lot are going, then we're certainly coming along.<br>
We're equally curious about your combat styles. Plus, this is a good opportunity to learn more about each other.<br>
<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
...What?!<br>
<br>
Using an attack method that disrupts spatial stability, Essex forcibly dismantled the existential structure of the corrosion phenomenon.<br>
While the immediate threat vanished in an instant, the group was then thrown into a more pressing crisis.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
Essex! We came here to investigate the spacetime anomaly! You can't simply bugger up space like that!<br>
The anomaly is far more dangerous than any bloody corrosion phenomenon!<br>
Is this how the Ashes always do things?!<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Essex META：</span><br>
Um...<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Enterprise META：</span><br>
...It's fine. I'll stabilize the area somehow.<br>
<br>
Enterprise META's rigging seemed to be connected to a vast array of devices within its storage space.<br>
She activated one of these devices, which gradually brought the spatial anomaly in the whole area under control.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
Is that... technology from the alpha timeline?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Enterprise META：</span><br>
Just standard equipment for a Task Force.<br>
Standard equipment from... much later on.<br>
Do you see the gap in power between us now?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
How many relics from the alpha timeline do you have?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Enterprise META：</span><br>
I don't like the word "relic."<br>
That said, I've got a few...<br>
...Huh?<br>
Looks like another spacetime anomaly has come up.<br>
It isn't Essex's fault. Some enormous energy entity is approaching from the outside.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
Approaching from the outside?<br>
Yes, we can feel it... Something is coming!<br>

<br>
Transboundary Experiment #3: Imposter<br>
Objective: To achieve ultimate victory<br>
Phase 1: Secondary Mimic Entities<br>
Construct secondary entities using Arbiters as receptors.<br>
Secondary entities will be perceived as X, making them immune to X corrosion.<br>
While secondary entities cannot typically be controlled, their receptor Arbiters will be able to.<br>
Secondary entities can be born from vector zones, but their debris will only form vector zones at 0.1% efficiency.<br>
This will allow them to compete with the X.<br>
Phase 2: Veil of Immunity<br>
As the secondary mimic entities are perceived as X, once their density exceeds a critical point, the X will cease reproduction.<br>
A world overrun by secondary entities is also perceived as one overrun by X.<br>
Once a Veil of secondary entities is built around the world, the X will be unable to pierce it.<br>
Based on mind mapping, the Veil itself will be perceived as the world.<br>
While secondary entities cannot typically be controlled, their receptor Arbiters will be able to.<br>
Thus, a barrier of immunity has been built.<br>
Phase 3: Predation<br>
Once the Veil of immunity is perceived as the X, the X will be able to enter unimpeded.<br>
When they do, they will be engulfed by the secondary entities.<br>
The secondary entities will suffer losses in the process, but devouring the X will aid in their proliferation.<br>
Through this process, a self-repairing barrier will be built.<br>
Outside the Veil, the Arbiters continued their final preparations.<br>

<br>
On our third day here, Lexington and I took a flight to Seattle.<br>
The bird's-eye view from the plane gave me a new perspective on this world's advancement and prosperity.<br>
That night, we boarded a cruiser at Seattle's port and began our journey to Anchorage.<br>
Along the way, we forgot our troubles and just focused on enjoying each other's company.<br>
Time flies when you're having fun. Before we knew it, the sun was rising on the third day of our journey.<br>
In the hazy morning, I was stunned by the Anchorage I saw. It was a bustling metropolis the likes of which I couldn't have imagined.<br>
When the ferry docked, Lexington and I met with the fleet garrisoned there.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">William D. Porter：</span><br>
Welcome to the city of Anchorage! I'm William D. Porter, captain of the 7th Task Force's William D. Porter squadron!<br>
Commander, Lexington. We appreciate you coming all this way!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lexington II：</span><br>
You're with the 7th Task Force?<br>
Umm, well... I guess we can go with that for now.<br>
Have the other VIPs arrived yet?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Clarence K. Bronson：</span><br>
Not yet. I'm afraid you two were the first to arrive. The others should disembark within a week.<br>
Incidentally, the optimal viewing period will be a week from now.<br>
There will be an intense geomagnetic storm at the time, so be sure to protect any sensitive equipment you have on hand.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lexington II：</span><br>
We'll be careful. Thank you for the warning.<br>
It looks like we have a free week to ourselves, Commander!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
A whole week, huh? Guess we'll get to explore the city all we want.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pasadena：</span><br>
Heheh, this is like the most famous resort city on the planet. You two won't be disappointed!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lexington II：</span><br>
Do you have any recommendations for sights to see?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pasadena：</span><br>
Anchorage is mostly split up between its urban zone, industrial zone, high-tech zone, defensive control zone, and nature reserves.<br>
The urban zone has all you could ever want, of course. You gotta check out the Anchorage Historical Museum while you're here!<br>
As for the industrial zone, it's a little different from normal ones because it doesn't use Wisdom Cube technology.<br>
I dunno, it could be worth checking out. I don't really know anything about that stuff... Heh.<br>
The town of Whittier is pretty close by. You might've heard of the historical Begich Towers.<br>
If you look over the industrial zone from there, it'll feel like you've gone back in time!<br>
Anyway, the high-tech zone. It's mostly companies involved in space travel and extraterrestrial exploration.<br>
Don't know much about that stuff, either... Could be cool to check it out, though!<br>
The defensive control zone... Eh, I don't think there's much of interest there.<br>
Oh, but we have the Anchorage National Observatory, so our defenses are way better than most other coastal cities.<br>
It's not much of a vacation spot, but if you like that stuff, go for it.<br>
As for me, I love the nature reserves all around!<br>
There are a lot of cute wild animals out there, and they've got unique glacier tours, too.<br>
Oh! Speaking of, the observatory is on top of a mountain in one of the nature reserves.<br>
Even if you're not there to stargaze, the views from there are breathtaking.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lexington II：</span><br>
So, in short... Every place is worth visiting?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pasadena：</span><br>
That's right!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lexington II：</span><br>
Heehee. I think we're in for the vacation of our lives, Commander.<br>

<br>
"Welcome, all guests, to Anchorage. We hope you have a wonderful time here.<br>
Here is the morning news.<br>
Brought to you by the OXS Trade Alliance.<br>
OXS' newest Lightbeam-series engine has passed simulation tests with flying colors.<br>
With this, all components of the Council's next-generation space exploration craft have been completed.<br>
We've conquered the moon, and now,<br>
it's time for humanity to look toward Mars."<br>
Last night, Council member Colette arrived in Anchorage.<br>
I had memories of meeting that woman, so I was curious to know more about her. I quickly made plans to meet and chat with her.<br>
I thought she'd ask to meet up in the high-tech zone, but surprisingly, she chose a glacier hiking trail in a natural reserve.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Colette：</span><br>
Long time no see, {playername}.<br>
You said the Second Mass Syncope gave you amnesia, right?<br>
How are you feeling now? Have you gone to a clinic?<br>
<br>
During our preliminary contact yesterday, I told her about my memory loss.<br>
I knew I wouldn't be able to hide that fact in front of my old friends in the Council.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I haven't had the time, but memories are coming back here and there.<br>
It's just that my mind is still such a mess.<br>
<br>
It isn't quite a lie, but I'm also not telling her the full truth. Call it selective honesty.<br>
This has always been the best option to avoid risking any space-time paradoxes.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Colette：</span><br>
You're not the only one, buddy... My mind's been a total wreck these past few days, too.<br>
I've made no progress on my projects whatsoever.<br>
Everyone else is in the same boat, so I've put my team on paid leave for a few days.<br>
That's why I'm here in Anchorage... To clear my mind and get my head straight.<br>
The girls went crazy when they heard you'd be here, you know.<br>
I know how eager they are. Don't worry, I won't get in the way of your little reunion.<br>
I'll go check out that frozen lake, so you chat all you want.<br>
<br>
Like Colette said, Memphis META and Vestal META came along with her.<br>
This is my first time meeting with them since Helena left us.<br>
If it really is them...<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Memphis META：</span><br>
Commander! It's been so long!<br>
I can't believe you got here before us!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Memphis, Vestal... Do you remember me? All of me?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Vestal META：</span><br>
Of course we do. We remember the real past and the dreams we had during the Mass Syncope.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
...Then do you consider the past and the Mass Syncope dreams just dreams, while this moment alone is reality?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Vestal META：</span><br>
Yes... We discussed it before we came here, actually. Both of us consider this moment in time reality.<br>
This world is just so perfect. It's the world we deserve – the world everybody deserves.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Memphis META：</span><br>
Don't worry. This world isn't missing anything. Everyone is here.<br>
You've noticed that by now, haven't you?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
...Maybe so.<br>
Okay. If that's your decision.<br>
Let's get going. Colette's already left us in the dust.<br>
If this world is perfect, then it'd be a waste to stand around all day, right?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Memphis META：</span><br>
Yeah. Let's go!<br>
And Lexington, I'm so glad to see you again!<br>
Let's enjoy our perfect future together.<br>

<br>
"Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Another wonderful day is ahead of us.<br>
Here is the morning news.<br>
Project H has now granted testing access to the general public,<br>
an act that has replaced the world's fears and doubts about the Antiochus with anticipation.<br>
The group in charge of this project, Team Swordholder,<br>
has stated that in addition to this project, they are also working on Projects E and M,<br>
the details of which will be gradually revealed over the course of this year.<br>
Stay tuned for more!"<br>
If this world we're in is related to Helena, then Memphis' and Vestal's choice starts to make sense.<br>
What really surprises me is that even Council members like Colette have retained their past memories, and not just regular people.<br>
She says that she can remember everything from before the Final Magistration, but considers it no more than knowledge gained from a dream.<br>
This knowledge is completely different to the real memories in your head.<br>
Whether Colette's case is unique or not is a question I'll learn the answer to when I meet Aoste.<br>
Based on the information Lexington got from TORCH's server, he and Eutopia Savoy will arrive around noon.<br>
Also accompanying them are Project H and Project M, in possession of experimental vessels.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Prototype versions of Hierophant and Magician, by the sound of it. I won't lie, I am curious to meet them...<br>
<br>
Aoste chose the Anchorage industrial area as our meeting spot.<br>
He said he picked it to "study the practical use of the cutting-edge geothermal energy technology."<br>
However, as soon as he arrived, he paid no heed to any of the local facilities, choosing instead to present Hierophant's vessel to me.<br>
In all likelihood, he just wanted to show off in a secluded place.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dr. Aoste：</span><br>
The Arbiter Program... A name befitting my title.<br>
This is Project H in her completed form. Go on, say hello to the Mysterious One.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Project H：</span><br>
Good to see you again, {playername}. This is our first meeting in the real world!<br>
How do you like my look?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Holy hell! Hierophant spoke! And wow, I never thought she'd be so expressive!)<br>
(So this is what she's like when she can move freely. I guess it echoes the notion that the Antiochus are meant to be affable.)<br>
(That's some interesting gear she has...)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Eutopia Savoy：</span><br>
Heh. You were surprised, too, I see.<br>
I don't blame you. Anyone would be, seeing such an utterly normal-looking girl carrying such terrifying equipment.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dr. Aoste：</span><br>
That WAS a concern of mine – that the contrast was too strong.<br>
But, after my experience with the Mass Syncope, I've come to believe that this is exactly how it should be.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Eutopia Savoy：</span><br>
It sounds to me like you've just grown accustomed to the way she looks.<br>
What will you do to make her more affable?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dr. Aoste：</span><br>
The design of her outfit is unchanged, mind you. I'd argue that it is still cute and affable.<br>
You don't intend on letting her attend a large social event dressed in full combat gear, are you? That'd be terrifying.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Eutopia Savoy：</span><br>
Heh. Someone is thinking that, but I won't say who.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dr. Aoste：</span><br>
Ahem... That aside, let me now introduce you to Madam M.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Wait, Madam M has existed for this long?)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Project M：</span><br>
Greetings, {playername}. Greetings, Miss Lexington.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Eutopia Savoy：</span><br>
Needless to say, her appearance is perfect, but her AI personality needs further improvement.<br>
Ah, right – I've heard that your after-symptoms are especially severe, with amnesia on top of that.<br>
Would you be interested in joining Madam M for some training in the environmental simulator?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Does it... work?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Eutopia Savoy：</span><br>
Oh. I was merely joking, but I suppose that didn't come across.<br>
No matter... Aoste, continue.<br>
<br>
Based on Aoste's and Eutopia's conversation, I established that their condition was the same as Colette's.<br>
What's more, apparently the whole Council has gathered here in order to make use of a project that's been long under preparation at the observatory with the goal of investigating the last Mass Syncope.<br>
At the same time, I gained some new information.<br>
Unlike both humans and shipgirls, the Antiochus have no memories from the Mass Syncope.<br>
In this regard, it was exactly the same as the first Mass Syncope.<br>
And yet, for some reason, I couldn't help but feel that something was... unusual about Hierophant today.<br>

<br>
"Please beware of extremely cold temperatures today.<br>
Here is the morning news.<br>
The Amahara Foundation has announced that their large-scale virtual reality project, titled 'Sky Realm Amahara,' will be terminated within the month.<br>
A spokesperson for the Foundation said that this decision was made due to a revolutionary technological breakthrough,<br>
which necessitates a complete overhaul of the project.<br>
They say that it will return in the future with a version 2.0,<br>
and that they hope to see you then."<br>
Today, a mysterious woman I've encountered before arrived. In my memories, she was always shrouded in black mist, and I could hear her voice, but never see her.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Ryouko Amahara – member of the Council, head of the Sky Realm Amahara Project, and president of the Amahara Foundation.<br>
<br>
For her meeting spot, Ryouko chose the Anchorage Historical Museum.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ryouko Amahara：</span><br>
Do you want something from me?<br>
Is this about needing funding for experiments again? Or do you seek some "special assistance" beyond the rules?<br>
<br>
Because I've completely forgotten about this prestigious lady, I struggle to respond to this unique opener.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lexington II：</span><br>
Miss Ryouko, the Commander is suffering from some after-effects from the latest Mass Syncope...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ryouko Amahara：</span><br>
Is that so? I'd heard about that, but I didn't think it would be quite this bad.<br>
It reminds me of Akagi...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
...Akagi?<br>
<br>
That's one name I wasn't expecting to hear right now.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Did something happen to her?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ryouko Amahara：</span><br>
Her case is largely the same as yours. Her memory is a mess, and she has forgotten many things.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Tower wasn't exactly nice to Akagi either, but she seems to be getting targeted a lot lately...)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ryouko Amahara：</span><br>
Everyone treats this Mass Syncope and the last one as the same, but in reality, this one was far more serious.<br>
From looking at the cases we're aware of, the after-symptoms of this one can be divided into six grades based on severity: S, A, B, C, D, and E.<br>
There was but one symptom following the First Mass Syncope: Mental unease due to confused memories. This translates into a mere D-grade case by these metrics.<br>
A mild case, in other words – fitting only into the second-lowest grade.<br>
In Akagi's case, her symptoms correspond to a grade of B.<br>
I haven't comprehensively evaluated your symptoms yet, but if they don't impede your day-to-day life, they can't be worse than a B.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
...What's an A or S-grade case like?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ryouko Amahara：</span><br>
Someone with an A-grade case has suffered severe psychological trauma, and developed illnesses like mania or schizophrenia overnight. This also includes suicidal thoughts.<br>
Almost all of these people have been admitted to special observation wards.<br>
The S grade is still speculative, but it's something even worse: Complete disappearance from reality without anyone realizing it.<br>
Since there's currently no evidence to support this theory, I've provisionally assigned it to the grade of S.<br>
Sadly, my instincts tend to be right. In fact, the reason I've done so much research into the field of mentality and consciousness is to explore the cause behind instincts.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I never would've expected that...<br>
By the way, the morning news said the Sky Realm Amahara Project is being suspended. Is that true?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ryouko Amahara：</span><br>
Yes.<br>
I've already paid the price for it once before...<br>
Now that I've gotten a chance to start over, I won't make the same mistake twice.<br>
<br>
Ryouko, like everyone else, believed that the world we're in is reality, but also that there are some "points of suspicion" that warrant investigation.<br>
She was accompanied by two shipgirls – Kasumi META and Jintsuu META.<br>
Speaking to them revealed that their attitude toward this world was the same as that of Memphis and Vestal.<br>
Over the past few days, I, too, have experienced this world as reality.<br>
Interestingly, never before have the members of the Council been as open to talk as they are now.<br>
I'm starting to think that these people are right – that this might actually be the "real" world.<br>
Besides, what reason would they have to lie to me?<br>
I just can't understand how Helena achieved this. That's still a question firmly on my mind.<br>
Just as others have doubts that they can't let go of.<br>
Maybe it's because there are flaws in the data that Helena and the Tower possess. Maybe it's some other reason I can't even think of.<br>
Either way, one thing is for sure...<br>
Even if this is the real world, this "perfect" future is flawed.<br>

<br>
"In response to the current cold wave, both indoor and outdoor heating have been activated across the city. We hope you have a warm and pleasant day.<br>
Here is the morning news.<br>
The highly anticipated movie 'Frequency' is nearing its release date.<br>
In a statement made just earlier at a pre-release event in NY Harbor,<br>
Bon Homme Richard said that everyone who buys a ticket in advance has the chance to win a poster of the movie signed by her.<br>
This offer is available in all movie theaters across the world.<br>
That concludes this morning's news.<br>
I've got to go out and buy a ticket myself."<br>
Today, Anzeel arrived in Anchorage.<br>
It wasn't just her, either. An "aggressive" entourage of many shipgirls came with her.<br>
How many? Their numbers were greater than the entire fleet stationed at Anchorage.<br>
Sounds exactly like what Anzeel would do.<br>
Since she had something she had to deal with immediately after landing, my time to meet her was set to early in the evening.<br>
Owing to the high enthusiasm among the crowd, this evening meeting grew into a large party scheduled to last until late in the night.<br>
When Lexington and I arrived in the mountains, she swiftly joined the group cooking for the event.<br>
She then urged me to get behind the bar counter and mix cocktails.<br>
Unfortunately, I had no memory of being a mixologist, so I turned her down.<br>
So, half-reluctantly, I instead took on another arduous duty – "guest greeter."<br>
A dense crowd mingles in the garden, faces coming and going constantly.<br>
There are more than a few that I even recognize.<br>
For instance, Memphis, Vestal, Jintsuu, Kasumi...<br>
William D. Porter, Pasadena, Cowpens, and Clarence K. Bronson.<br>
Despite being the local fleet responsible for its defense, they are able to attend this party tonight because Anzeel got Hierophant and Magician to take on their duties.<br>
Some of the faces in the crowd, however, are not familiar to me.<br>
Such as META versions of Hornet, Dewey, Cleveland, and Essex.<br>
Lastly, there is one person in the crowd whom I can't simply say I do or don't know.<br>
That being Enterprise META, whom I haven't seen in so long.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Enterprise META：</span><br>
...You're the last person I expected would be a guest greeter.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
We meet again, Enterprise.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Enterprise META：</span><br>
Have you met everyone whom you ought to?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Truth be told, I haven't seen Anzeel just yet.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Enterprise META：</span><br>
Knowing her, she'll come running as soon as she's finished her errand.<br>
We have no time limit here, so I doubt anything unexpected will happen.<br>
I heard about you from Memphis, among others. Your view was exactly as I expected.<br>
But, now that a few days have passed, has that view not changed at all?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I now accept this world as the real one.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Enterprise META：</span><br>
Despite you sounding positive, that serious look on your face tells me there's a "but."<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
You're right. There are flaws in this world.<br>
A flawed world literally cannot be perfect. I have doubts that this world is even stable.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Enterprise META：</span><br>
That's an issue that we and the Council will have to solve.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I know that Anzeel and her team will work hard on it – but will YOU do anything other than ignore it?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Enterprise META：</span><br>
Call me too passive if you want... What matters is that Anzeel is back. Can you think of anything that she can't solve?<br>
Look, you...<br>
Do we really have to make this clear right here, right now?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Okay, I see your point.<br>
Welcome to the party. I hope you have a good time, Enterprise.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Enterprise META：</span><br>
...Thanks, Commander.<br>
<br>
Anzeel's business caused her to be late, and she didn't arrive until dinner time.<br>
While the rest of the party chats away cheerfully, I finally manage to reunite with her...<br>
Anzeel, free and unbound by any cage.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dr. Anzeel：</span><br>
*sigh*... Work while on vacation, and vacation while at work...<br>
It's like... my vacation is a job, and my job is a vacation!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(She has somehow gotten drunk on the low-percentage stuff they're serving...)<br>
<br>
This is how I learn that Anzeel gets drunk very easily.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dr. Anzeel：</span><br>
Hey, assistant, whatcha looking so sour for? C'mon, grab a drink with me!<br>
If something's weighing you down, I'd be happy to hear you out!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Nothing's "weighing me down" in that sense. Also, I think you've had enough for tonight.<br>
Lexington, would you do me a favor and take away all the alcohol from her?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lexington II：</span><br>
Will do!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dr. Anzeel：</span><br>
Pssh! Fine! I'll stop drinking and get back to work!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I wasn't saying you have to work instead. Besides, do you really think you're fit to work right now?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dr. Anzeel：</span><br>
I'll wing it! Just gonna let instinct take the wheel!<br>
You know, when you just can't decide on something, but you've got to make a choice...<br>
That's when you turn to your instinct!<br>
I mean, hey, that's what YOU'VE always done... How come you're hesitating this time?<br>
Ohh, I get it. Aoste has been a bad influence on you!<br>
He's an academic to the bone – there's an impossibly high wall between him and people like us!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(What is she talking about? I'm pretty sure she and he went to the same college.)<br>
(...Cider? This is what got her drunk?)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dr. Anzeel：</span><br>
Hey, Enterprise! Bring me something to drink!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
You sure you haven't had enough?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Enterprise META：</span><br>
Alright.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dr. Anzeel：</span><br>
Heheh!<br>
<br>
Anzeel winks at me triumphantly.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dr. Anzeel：</span><br>
Mmm... Ahh!<br>
Tonight's a party, so I'm gonna drink all I want!<br>
My villa's big, so anyone who gets wasted can just stay here until tomorrow!<br>
Don't worry, I already arranged everything in advance!<br>
We got no work – not tonight, tomorrow, or the day after that!<br>

<br>
"A fog warning has been issued today, so please be careful while traveling.<br>
Here is the morning news.<br>
Project Dawn has concluded its third stage of trials.<br>
The Council's 5th Task Force successfully completed its tests,<br>
and is expected to return by the early morning.<br>
As of today, all naval restrictions in the Bering Sea have been lifted."<br>
Early in the morning, shortly after returning to my hotel room and going to sleep, there's a sudden knock on the door.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lexington II：</span><br>
Commander, you have a guest.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
...This early? Who?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lexington II：</span><br>
It's Miss Sophia and Princeton META.<br>
They traveled here overnight after completing their trials in the Bering Sea.<br>
Also... Sophia's acting a little weird.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
"Weird"?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lexington II：</span><br>
Yes. She said she's looking for "the Commander of the Azur Lane."<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Huh?!<br>
<br>
A short while later, I come face to face with Sophia in the parlor.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sophia：</span><br>
We meet again, {playername}... Or should I say, "It's a pleasure to make your acquaintance, Commander of the Azur Lane"?<br>
<br>
Based on what I've learned in the past few days, there are three types of people in this perfect future.<br>
The first is those who couldn't escape from the past. Anzeel and Aoste belong to this category.<br>
They've retained their memories from the alpha timeline, while also possessing memories of living in this world. They believe their memories from this world are their real memories.<br>
The second type is those who did manage to escape from the past, but were thrust into this "perfect future" for one reason or another. Memphis and Enterprise are the prime examples of this.<br>
Just like the first type, they have two sets of memories at the same time, but they consider their memories from the alpha timeline to be real while those from this world are fake.<br>
The third and last type is unique. It's those who don't have any memories of living in this world. I thought this was only the case for Lexington and myself...<br>
But it seems Sophia is one as well.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Sophia, you...<br>
<br>
You're still alive? You escaped, but how? Do you know about the "Silver Fox" that Constellation's team encountered?<br>
There is so much I want to ask.<br>
But, looking into her calm yet dissuading eyes, I find myself unable to muster a question.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
...Are you really Sophia?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sophia：</span><br>
Yes.<br>
As for the "why," that question is likely just as complicated as what happened to you.<br>
Let's skip the questions that we both can't answer and get down to business.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
You sound like you know something.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sophia：</span><br>
Yes. I know everything that there is to know.<br>
Including how our struggle ended in failure, and how the Magister Plan was executed.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Then what do you think about this "perfect future" that Helena constructed?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sophia：</span><br>
Helena? So it was her... That explains a lot of things.<br>
I suggest we save the topic of Helena for later. More pertinently, I am sure beyond a doubt that this situation is abnormal.<br>
While it may seem that all the elements that make up the world are present, in reality, it's still not complete.<br>
Are you familiar with the shock wave that comes with METAmorphosis that causes severe damage to electronics?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Yeah.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sophia：</span><br>
Princeton, turn to the television and release a low-powered, directional shock wave.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Princeton META：</span><br>
Roger.<br>
<br>
Princeton took aim at the television in the living room and activated some sort of military device.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
...Nothing happened. Why?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sophia：</span><br>
Although METAmorphosis does exist in this world, none of the negative traits that come with it are present.<br>
Some sort of wall might exist beyond this world, and it likely blocks out all harmful information.<br>
I believe that it is responsible for creating this "perfect future," that is, a future without the X.<br>
If a world's continued existence requires certain equipment – or even certain people – then can it really be relied on?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Is that the reason why you doubt this "perfect future"?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sophia：</span><br>
It's only one reason out of several.<br>
Every person should have the right to enjoy this moment. From those who fell in the past, to those who fight even to this day.<br>
However, that does not include me. Not the Council's 5th Task Force.<br>
...To defend our home. To protect humanity.<br>
That was our sworn duty. The world fell, and we failed to fulfill it.<br>
That's why we need to keep moving forward, no matter what happens.<br>
I will not be stopped... by a future that appears to be perfect.<br>
Now, let me address the Helena question.<br>
Do you know why I decided to come straight to you?<br>
Because someone sent Helena to my fleet. Helena from the Azur Lane.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
What?! OUR Helena?!<br>
How'd she get wrapped up in this? Where is she? Is she okay?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sophia：</span><br>
Take it easy. She's at my place right now.<br>
I had to first make sure that you were who I thought you were, so I couldn't bring her with me so easily.<br>
Now that I've verified your identity, I can bring you to her.<br>
We'll continue our discussion over at my place.<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=Resolve|选项=20|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<br>
When Sophia said "her place," she wasn't talking about a hotel room, but rather the Calabrian Pride – the flagship of the Council's 5th Task Force, anchored at the naval station.<br>
I'm shown to a cabin, where I find Helena.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
Commander... Thank gosh I finally found you.<br>
<br>
Although a little anxious, she maintains a comparatively calm demeanor.<br>
After going through a series of bizarre events in succession, she must have adapted to it somewhat.<br>
Based on Sophia's findings, "Helena" in this world very specifically refers to the one standing before me.<br>
The importance of this fact is self-apparent.<br>
It means that the creator of this perfect future, Helena META, does not exist in this world.<br>
Not only is she looking down on us from a higher dimension, but she also has no place in this beautiful future.<br>
Perhaps that's why she had to drag another version of herself into this.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(That fact alone disqualifies this future from being called perfect.)<br>
<br>
Tomorrow is the day when the unusual weather event will appear over Anchorage. It's also when the Council will enact its plan.<br>
Sophia and I both suspect that this timing holds some kind of significance.<br>
Helena META might even have purposefully planned this very event for these various factions to gather.<br>
I can't imagine what reason she'd have for it, but it is a chance to get in direct contact with her.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sophia：</span><br>
We should split up. I'll go to Aoste, and you'll go to Anzeel.<br>
Whatever happens, everyone needs to know the truth... then make a choice.<br>
<br>
On my way to Anzeel's holiday house, I run into Enterprise META and Essex META.<br>
Apparently, they've been waiting here for quite some time.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Enterprise META：</span><br>
......<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lexington II：</span><br>
Don't get in the Commander's way, Enterprise. Even you can't stop this.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Enterprise META：</span><br>
So this is your choice, Lexington...<br>
{playername}, give it up already.<br>
I'm not an emotionless machine like the Antiochus. I really can kill you if you push me too far.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Okay.<br>
If all of this is a mirage that's so easily dispelled, then there's no point in killing me.<br>
On the other hand, if what you see now is truly reality as we know it, then it won't end just because you killed me.<br>
Besides, Helena META created this world. Would she really let you kill me in her world?<br>
Come on, Enterprise. It's time to stop making pointless threats.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Enterprise META：</span><br>
...Then answer this.<br>
Why is it that those incapable of anything are still alive...<br>
While those capable of everything are dead, and those who wanted to live the most wound up perishing?<br>
We've lost everyone we were meant to protect... What do we even have left to live for?<br>
What I yearn for isn't eradicating the X, and freeing humanity from its shackles...<br>
What I yearn for is them. I want them back.<br>
I want back all the things and people that I held dearest but lost... and right now, I have them.<br>
Do you understand what that means?<br>
...No, you don't.<br>
You've forgotten everything. That's why you're able to be so ruthless.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
You're right. I have forgotten everything.<br>
But Anzeel, Aoste, and Sophia – they still remember.<br>
Does it look to you like they became engrossed in this world? Like they stopped investigating?<br>
The Council already made a choice back then. What do you think they'll decide to do this time when they learn the truth?<br>
Hell, that's exactly why you're standing in my way now, isn't it?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Enterprise META：</span><br>
......<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Essex META：</span><br>
Heh... Haha...<br>
Why? Why are you always thinking only about yourself?!<br>
How can you be so selfish that you won't even let us save you?<br>
Well... Since you're so relentlessly egotistical, isn't it fair for us to do what WE want for once?<br>
<br>
Essex META suddenly snaps, and a dark aura starts to emanate from her.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
What the hell?! Is this META corrosion?!<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Enterprise META：</span><br>
You... You're not the Essex from the test site.<br>
You're her... The Essex who should've died in the X's waves.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
She's what?!<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Enterprise META：</span><br>
Whatever! Just calm down!<br>
<br>
Enterprise activates some sort of machine that causes the surrounding META corrosion to instantly vanish. Essex, meanwhile, falls into a coma.<br>
This development was so sudden that both Enterprise and I are left speechless.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
...I don't mean to deny the beauty in everything that's here.<br>
I'm just saying that... she makes mistakes, she gets tired, and she also deserves to see this wonderful world.<br>
I don't want you to place the whole burden on her...<br>
Enterprise.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Enterprise META：</span><br>
...I'll look after Essex.<br>
Do whatever it is you want.<br>
<br>
Enterprise takes Essex with her and leaves.<br>
Now there's the one who stood by me from start to finish, unfazed by Enterprise's threats – Lexington.<br>
I can take Enterprise's questions in stride. However, when it comes to Lexington, who has been given a new lease on life thanks to this world...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Lexington... I'm sorry.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lexington II：</span><br>
Shh. You don't have to say anything.<br>
I'll support you no matter what choice you make.<br>
Let's go, shall we? We still have half a mountain to climb.<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dr. Anzeel：</span><br>
Ah! Assistant. There you are.<br>
Wait inside. The meeting is about to start.<br>
<br>
Anzeel assigns me a task the moment I enter the building, not even giving me the time to ask questions.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Sorry? What's this about?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dr. Anzeel：</span><br>
We've not just been sitting on our butts for the past few days. Our investigations have yielded results.<br>
Even Sophia's submitted a report. Once we've all read through it, we're gonna have a vote.<br>
Oh yeah, do you remember this?<br>
It's Steven Jr.'s invention! The device that lets you hold a meeting anywhere, anytime!<br>
<br>
Anzeel pushed a strange button, and her pleasant holiday home instantly transforms into a formal conference hall.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dr. Anzeel：</span><br>
You can move around freely in the hall, so pick any seat you want. Also, there'll just be the 22 of us Standing Committee members today.<br>
Ideally, I'd have gotten everyone to attend, but I had to call the meeting on short notice.<br>
As a result, many will be absent, and those who will attend can only do so via voice.<br>
<br>
With those words, people start to appear inside the conference hall one by one.<br>
There are faces I've seen over the past few days as well as complete strangers, with some hazy and black figures thrown in for good measure. That must be what she means by "voice only."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dr. Anzeel：</span><br>
20... 21... 22... Okay, that's everyone.<br>
Members of the committee, I wish you good morning, good day, and good evening.<br>
I'm Anzeel, and I'll be your chairwoman for this session.<br>
I hereby declare the opening of this extraordinary meeting for the Standing Committee of the Joint Council. It'll probably be our last one...<br>
I presume that we've all already read Sophia's report, so let's immediately start voting on specific issues.<br>
Oh, assistant – just raise your hand to vote. It'll be counted automatically.<br>
<br>
Despite this being an unplanned meeting, it moves on to the voting stage smoothly and quickly.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dr. Anzeel：</span><br>
Topic One: Shall the Council's observation activities proceed as scheduled tomorrow?<br>
<br>
"Shall the Council's observation activities proceed as scheduled tomorrow?"<br>
In Favor: 22<br>
Against: 0<br>
Abstention: 0<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dr. Anzeel：</span><br>
22 in favor, 0 against, 0 abstentions. Topic one is approved unanimously.<br>
<br>
Tomorrow is the important date that Helena specifically set. Whatever she's planning, I hope it goes well.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dr. Anzeel：</span><br>
Topic Two: Can this world that we see be defined as "real"?<br>
<br>
"Can this world that we see be defined as 'real'?"<br>
In Favor: 15<br>
Against: 1<br>
Abstention: 6<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dr. Anzeel：</span><br>
15 in favor, 1 against, 6 abstentions. Topic two is approved with a majority.<br>
<br>
For this topic, Aoste, Colette, Eutopia, Ryouko, Li Hua, Steven Jr., and Ludwig, among others, voted in favor.<br>
Meanwhile, Sophia voted against it.<br>
Anzeel, Princess Maria, and some others abstained. So did I.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dr. Anzeel：</span><br>
Topic Three: Should we support {playername}'s future actions?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Here we go...)<br>
<br>
"Should we support {playername}'s future actions?"<br>
In Favor: 11<br>
Against: 4<br>
Abstention: 7<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dr. Anzeel：</span><br>
11 in favor, 4 against, 7 abstentions. There are more in favor than against, but it's not enough to reach a majority. It seems we've hit an impasse.<br>
As this is an urgent issue that requires an immediate conclusion, I will hereby invoke the impasse resolution system.<br>
Antiochus system, analyze this topic and draw a conclusion.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Observer Zero：</span><br>
Antiochus system is online. Orders received.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Pardon? Can we really let them make such a critical decision?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dr. Anzeel：</span><br>
Yes. In the event that opinions are split among the wisest people in the world, yet there's the need for an urgent conclusion, you should let the absolutely rational AI system decide.<br>
It'll be either in favor or against. The Antiochus system doesn't have the right to abstain.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Observer Zero：</span><br>
Chairwoman and members of the committee, the Antiochus system has reached a conclusion.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dr. Anzeel：</span><br>
Please tell us.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Observer Zero：</span><br>
"Should we support {playername}'s future actions?"<br>
The Antiochus system's conclusion is: In favor.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dr. Anzeel：</span><br>
Then, based on the Antiochus system's verdict, topic three is approved.<br>
This concludes our topics for today.<br>
I hereby declare this meeting of the Standing Committee of the Joint Council as over.<br>
Thank you all for coming.<br>
<br>
These extremely important questions were voted on in a stunningly short amount of time.<br>
There were no introductions, no comments, not even any final words to wrap up with.<br>
Despite this possibly being their last meeting, despite it possibly deciding the fate of the world...<br>
Meanwhile, I sit here in a daze as the figures and lights in the venue vanish one by one.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dr. Aoste：</span><br>
Hang on. Just a minute.<br>
Don't be in such a rush. I'd like to introduce a new– Well, I suppose I should say "reintroduce" an old friend to you.<br>
<br>
A familiar voice drags me back to reality, bringing just a hint of warmth to the solemn venue.<br>
Aoste approaches me with two dim masses of light and an elegantly-dressed woman. Sophia and Anzeel follow behind them.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dr. Aoste：</span><br>
Let me make you acquainted. This lady is Maria, a princess who's come from Iberia.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Maria：</span><br>
I am Maria. It's a pleasure.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dr. Aoste：</span><br>
This light figure to my left is Stephen Jr., from the Royal Islands. The one to my right is Li Hua, our friend from the Dragon Empery.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Stephen Jr.：</span><br>
How come you ain't using my code name, eh? What's wrong with it?<br>
Well... Greetings, Mysterious One! I am Stephen, the Dark Doctor!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I'm surprised to hear anyone willingly use the code name that Aoste gave them...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dr. Aoste：</span><br>
Some people enjoy having a code name. Also, I did not come up with his.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Li Hua：</span><br>
The plan was to follow Aoste's path until he had nowhere left to go. Unfortunately for me, my code name got popular in no time...<br>
Just know that we're not trying to be cold with you, alright?<br>
Then again... That is pretty much our usual way of doing things.<br>
Also, now that the decision has been made, most people probably want to make the most of what time they have left.<br>
For instance, there's one thing that I'm pretty concerned about right now!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
...What thing?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Li Hua：</span><br>
About a third of the Standing Committee is currently gathered in Anchorage. All it would take is one missile attack...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Maria：</span><br>
The defense system would surely intercept such a thing, no?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Li Hua：</span><br>
Ahaha... Hey, can you blame me for trying to make things a little more exciting?<br>
Anyway, I have some things to do at the Antarctic station, so I should get going.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Stephen Jr.：</span><br>
Good luck, mate!<br>
<br>
After that short encounter, the conference venue finally completely vanishes, and I'm back inside Anzeel's holiday house again.<br>
In the final moments before I leave, I swear that I hear Sophia whisper something next to me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sophia：</span><br>
Ladies and gentlemen... I promise I'll be back.<br>
Wait for me.<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bon Homme Richard：</span><br>
I know, you always went with your instincts.<br>
You always put yourself in the line of fire to save others.<br>
Even if you could do it all over again, you'd make the same choice.<br>
But this time, go the other way...<br>
If you just go the other way, you'll make it...<br>
<br>
Before I knew it, it was opening day for Richard's new movie, Frequency.<br>
Lexington and I were joined by Helena, Anzeel, Enterprise, Memphis, and William D. Porter's party to watch the Council's special screening.<br>
After that, I planned to stay at Anzeel's villa until it was time to go to the observatory after dinner.<br>
Lexington opted to do the same, but after lunch, she was on the phone with someone for a long time.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
The mission kicks off tonight, doesn't it?<br>
Sorry I couldn't make it...<br>
I heard all about it, though.<br>
Things have been a real mess here, too.<br>
The more I learn, the more questions I have.<br>
If this world really is reconstructed using memories of the past...<br>
Well, the data used in the process was pretty faulty, haha.<br>
So I...<br>
I think you've made the right decision.<br>
It has to be right...<br>
That's why I can't bear to come see you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lexington II：</span><br>
Sara...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
I'm sorry, Sis.<br>
Being busy was just a bad excuse.<br>
I want to see you...<br>
So, so much...<br>
But I just can't.<br>
If I see you in person, who knows what I'll do?<br>
You've made your decision, and I don't wanna get in the way of it.<br>
Sis...<br>
Do you think we'll ever see each other again?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lexington II：</span><br>
......<br>
I don't know.<br>
The Commander has a more perfect future in mind for us, though.<br>
I have faith that if that vision is realized, you and I will be reunited.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
You'd better promise me, Sis...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lexington II：</span><br>
Yeah... I promise.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
Phew...<br>
Goodbye, Sis. I hope it all works out.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lexington II：</span><br>
...Goodbye, my dear sister.<br>
<br>
Our last day of leisure passed by in the blink of an eye.<br>
Enterprise and Memphis didn't say another word.<br>
After dinner, the solar wind intensified, causing a geomagnetic storm. The night sky was filled with a dazzling aurora.<br>
The Council members – Aoste, Sophia, Ryouko Amahara, Colette, and Eutopia – each departed with resolve burning in their hearts.<br>
Anzeel personally drove us to Anchorage National Observatory. After that, she led her team to do what they needed to do.<br>
Lexington, Helena, and I walked slowly down the last stretch of road to the observation tower.<br>
The observation tower stood 1,750 meters high. It took a minute for the elevator to travel from base to peak.<br>
A mere sixty seconds, but this minute was the longest I'd ever experienced.<br>
I turned to Lexington. Scenes from the past couple of weeks flashed through my mind.<br>
When I looked at Helena, the memories of our time together seemed more vivid than ever.<br>
It was a painful journey, but a necessary one.<br>
If I didn't move forward, then the possibility of overcoming all of this sorrow would be reduced to nothing.<br>
We were close enough now that the aurora seemed within arm's reach. In that moment, we were bathed in dazzling light.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lexington II：</span><br>
Farewell, my Commander.<br>
We'll meet again someday.<br>

<br>
In the harsh light, I remembered a few things.<br>
After the conference, Lexington made a rare homecoming from the front lines.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lexington：</span><br>
I heard the final tally.<br>
612 in favor, 219 against, 169 abstentions. The proposal was sent to the Standing Committee for a vote.<br>
The committee voted 11 in favor, 11 against, and no abstentions... No majority vote.<br>
In the end, they invoked the impasse resolution system, and the Antiochus system voted in favor of a counterattack.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
...Their decision has been made. All we can do is, do our best.<br>
Besides, we aren't guaranteed to lose. It's just that every single step we take has to be perfect.<br>
I promise, we will win.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lexington：</span><br>
Okay. I have faith in you, Commander!<br>
<br>
Thus began the decisive battle that I was powerless to prevent.<br>
I experienced the joys of small victories, the anxiety of every stalemate, the horror of every drop of bad news...<br>
And... the pain of seeing Lexington self-destruct with my own two eyes because we were mere seconds too late.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
She always put off her Type-II retrofitting, letting other shipgirls take advantage of those resources.<br>
She took my advice and refused to resort to METAmorphosis.<br>
In the end... she protected Saratoga, Helena, and everybody else in the fleet.<br>
So I swore that, as long as the Wisdom Cube network remains intact, I'll do whatever it takes, pay whatever it costs, to see her resurrected.<br>
<br>
Unbearable pain shot through me.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
It is unbearable, isn't it?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Helena... We meet again.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
Long time no see, Commander.<br>
<br>
She approaches me, still bearing that same mysterious smile.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
After leaving you, I interfered with the Antiochus' transboundary experiment in test site theta and seized their research results.<br>
The Veil of Immunity – technology that can truly protect the world from the X.<br>
The world you see now was born from this technology.<br>
I sculpted this future. The perfect future that everyone deserved.<br>
Then, I separated this branch and all of its possibilities from the collective – like taking a cutting from a plant.<br>
Freeing it from the influence of test site alpha, allowing it to grow anew in a land far divorced from the past.<br>
<br>
We walk side by side on the vast, white beach.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
Were you happy, Commander?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Hmm... Half yes, half no.<br>
That world is beautiful, but it doesn't have you. How could anyone call it perfect?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
But it has everybody else.<br>
Myself versus the rest of the world... I think it's an easy decision, don't you?<br>
Don't be greedy and say you want both.<br>
A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush, you know.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
If "both" isn't an option, then I choose to abstain.<br>
Maybe that world will become reality if I have faith in it...<br>
But I could never.<br>
How long can you sustain this all on your own? Five years? Ten? Fifty?<br>
Whatever the case, this perfect future isn't forever.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
Hehe... My original plan did involve it lasting forever.<br>
But you see the result. I did my very best, but in just over ten days, it's been poked full of holes.<br>
I couldn't do it all on my own.<br>
So Commander... Will you help me?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Huh?<br>
<br>
She makes a surprising proposition.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
You're the basis of hope, the seed of miracles, and the key to cognitive awakening.<br>
You and I could be the gods who protect this perfect future.<br>
That way, you and I, along with all the people of the world...<br>
All of us will make it. You can have everything your heart desires.<br>
What do you say? Is this an acceptable offer?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I...<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
Do you accept, or do you refuse?<br>
Sometimes, Commander, we have to make a decision.<br>
<br>
"Now is the time to choose."<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
…………<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：(Accept Helena's proposal.)</span>'''''<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Warning: This is an important choice that will affect the ending. Are you sure?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项100：(I'm sure. Let's do this.)</span>'''''<br>
<br>
I accepted Helena's proposal.<br>
She stopped for a moment, but instantly after, she dove into my arms.<br>
The two of us became one in a flash of light.<br>
On the eighth day after our arrival in Anchorage, the solar wind gradually subsided. In turn, the geomagnetic storm and aurora faded.<br>
The Council investigation turned up fruitless.<br>
After all, every anomaly had been fixed.<br>
The effects of the Mass Syncopes disappeared over time, and so too did the memories of their dreams.<br>
A few days later, the world was peaceful.<br>
Everyone had forgotten about that little affair.<br>
Lexington, Enterprise, Memphis, Anzeel, Sophia, and everyone else who'd gone on that painful journey...<br>
They lived in a perfect new world.<br>
They lived happy lives.<br>
I sent Helena to test site beta.<br>
Thanks to the conceptual flaws within test site beta, we managed to revive Lexington through the same means we used for Amagi.<br>
After that, we covered test site beta in the Veil of Immunity.<br>
There are dimensions to times, too.<br>
To this day, I continue to be the Commander of test site beta.<br>
In the new world, the concept of Helena had disappeared.<br>
But I still remembered her.<br>
After all, she was right in front of me.<br>
I could see her. I could touch her.<br>
We built a home on a new platform, which we called the Helena Layer.<br>
In that new home, we continued exploring the mysteries of the Wisdom Cube network.<br>
We never stopped searching for the answers of higher dimensions.<br>
Even infinity has its gaps.<br>
Maybe we'd never be able to unravel the secret of the X.<br>
Maybe we'd never be able to leave the protection of the veil.<br>
But under this veil...<br>
We had freedom.<br>
"A new world, a perfect world."<br>
"For one story..."<br>
"To finally come to its happy ending..."<br>
"That's more than enviable enough."<br>
"Don't you think?"<br>

<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>

<br>
She gazed at me, displaying neither joy nor sorrow, leaving me no option but to speak.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
There might be some special quality to me.<br>
But how did that quality arise, and how special is it, really?<br>
Am I really enough to help you shoulder the weight of an entire world?<br>
You and I know exactly what pain comes with misusing technology we don't fully understand.<br>
The Council has already made the decision to support my actions.<br>
They support my efforts to restore history to its true form.<br>
So I'm sorry... but I just have to deny your proposal.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>

Lexington stands on the beach not far from us. Maybe she was there the whole time – I just never noticed her.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
Commander, you swore that you'd revive her someday, no matter what it takes.<br>
I made the same promise.<br>
For now, at least, we've kept that promise.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lexington II：</span><br>
Thank you, Helena... Thank you so much.<br>
I'm so happy that you made it out alive that day.<br>
But...<br>
No matter what happens, I'm always on the Commander's side.<br>
I made my decision long before we came here.<br>
This world might be real, and our souls might be real, too.<br>
But that reality only exists based on your observations.<br>
The future you sculpted was only perfect in your own heart.<br>
You're not a god. You can't bear this burden on your own.<br>
At this rate, you'll die...<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
...I don't care.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lexington II：</span><br>
I care! I can't stand the thought, and neither can our Commander!<br>
You said it yourself. It's barely been two weeks, if that, and the world is at its limit.<br>
What good would adding the Commander to the equation do?<br>
You're not omnipotent, and neither is the Commander. The Antiochus system surely isn't, either.<br>
Everybody makes mistakes. What happens when you do? Do you just paint it over with more lies?<br>
What do you do when the world has nothing left but contradictions?<br>
This isn't perfection. Not by a long shot.<br>
<br>
Lexington's voice quivers, but she does her best to stay calm.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lexington II：</span><br>
Helena, do you think Anzeel and all the others WANT to live in a world where you're the god in charge of everything?<br>
I have my doubts.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
…………<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Helena. If you wanted, you could ignore our opinions and force your plan through.<br>
Nobody would be able to refuse. If you took away all of our memories of the past, you'd have your way.<br>
You didn't, though.<br>
You preserved our memories, giving us the right to choose.<br>
That means you'll support our decision. Won't you?<br>
<br>
She gazes at me, eyes red from crying. I face her head-on.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
Okay... I'll do as you wish.<br>
<br>
Finally, she gives me a gentle smile.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
Everyone was happy in the past two weeks. I was happy, too.<br>
That's enough for me...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
You were on the right track, Helena.<br>
Our future SHOULD be this perfect.<br>
But the perfect future ahead of us is one that we have to fight for.<br>
Have faith.<br>
If we keep on walking forward with hope and volition in our hearts...<br>
Our story won't have a sad ending.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
Yes... I have faith in you, Commander.<br>
I'll always believe in you...<br>
<br>
Amidst the azure torrent, the world is enveloped in light.<br>
"It's time to awaken from this perfect dream."<br>

T=T-N<br>
When the light fades, we're back in the Galactic Core.<br>
Time hasn't passed since Helena spirited us away.<br>
The anomaly from before has overloaded a lot of the machinery, filling the Sea of Stars with a cacophony of alarms.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lexington II：</span><br>
Commander, am I... Is that you?<br>
<br>
Lexington slowly sits up from the care pod and looks around, bewildered.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Don't worry. The Sea of Stars is just malfunctioning a little.<br>
How do you feel? Anything immediately wrong?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lexington II：</span><br>
No... I feel totally normal.<br>
But this equipment... How can it be real?<br>
Commander, I feel like I've just woken up from a long dream...<br>
After the battle of the Coral Sea... In the care pod... In that dreamlike city...<br>
That wasn't just a dream, was it?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
It's all in the past now. The only reality is what we see and feel right now.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Welcome back, Lexington.</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lexington II：</span><br>
Commander... I'm finally home!<br>
<br>
After I told everyone that there was no emergency, the situation in the Sea of Stars calmed down.<br>
An uncanny silence fell over everyone when they witnessed the miracle in the care pod.<br>
Then, they cheered all at once.<br>
Saratoga ran to her first, followed by Memphis, then Helena...<br>
But it wasn't the tearful reunion I envisioned.<br>
Lexington and I were forced into a shuttle headed to the medical zone.<br>
Apparently, we wouldn't be allowed to leave without first receiving a thorough examination...<br>
As I lay down on the stretcher, Helena smiled quietly at me. Her reaction was a far cry from Memphis' excitement.<br>
Maybe Helena META let her see that final decision, too.<br>
And maybe she also remembered everything that had happened in the perfect world...<br>
"Either way, the world is finally back to normal."<br>
"It's all over..."<br>
"Or is it?"<br>
