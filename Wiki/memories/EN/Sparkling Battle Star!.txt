Chapter 1: A Seed is Sown<br>
One day at the port...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">San Diego：</span><br>
Lalala~♪<br>
What a great day to be me~! I feel awesome today! La la– Hey, what's going on over there?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
Sister Sara is leaving her nest and going in a new direction! I'm now making my official debut as Saratoga: The Little Witch Idol!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lexington：</span><br>
Now, now, Sara. You've grown thanks to your retrofit, but you need to act the part as well.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
Haha, sorry... I guess it's still too early to say I'm leaving the nest for real...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">San Diego：</span><br>
Howdy-do, Lex, Sara!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
Hey, Sandy!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lexington：</span><br>
It's always lovely to see you in a merry mood, San Diego~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">San Diego：</span><br>
I'm feeling great, hehe~ So, Sara, what's up with that outfit?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
Heh heh, you're keen as ever! Sara's almost done retrofitting, that's what!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">San Diego：</span><br>
Yup yup, I'm as keen and sharp as a shack! Also, what's a "retrofit"?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
A retrofit... *Ahem*! A retrofit is the fruit of much blood, sweat, and money poured into one single goal! To me, it's like my rebirth as an idol!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">San Diego：</span><br>
Wooow... I don't know what that means, but that sounds awesome!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
Hah hah hah! Now I must go and see what new pranks– I mean, new abilities I've gotten! To the Dormitory!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lexington：</span><br>
Sara! Don't run off without– *Sigh*, what am I to do with her... San Diego, don't take after her, okay?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">San Diego：</span><br>
Hmm... Retrofit, huh... I wanna know more...<br>
<br>
And so, the small seed that is the concept of retrofitting had been planted in San Diego's mind. Perhaps one day, it will sprout and grow into a glorious tree. But that remains to be seen.<br>

Chapter 2: The Quest for Knowledge<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
Heavy attack mode prepared, ready to use ultimate firepower!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ayanami：</span><br>
Bear witness to my Demon Dance...!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
Annihilation Mode reconfiguration complete... *Yawn*... I'm sleepy...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
Destruction Mode, initia– No, Laffey! Now's not the time for sleep! We agreed to display our cool team pose, remember?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ayanami：</span><br>
I'm feeling sleepy as well.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
You too, Ayanami?! Are Laffey's yawns this contagious?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
Ahaha... Well, standing like this is pretty tiring, so how about we take a break, Zed?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
No! Come on, we can't just quit, we're–<br>
Darn it... *Ahem*! Unfortunately, we could only show you for a few seconds... but in essence, that is what a retrofit is like, San Diego!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">San Diego：</span><br>
Neato! That was your "retrofit aura" thingy, right?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
Err... That's right! It's essential to leave an impression, or – as you say – have an aura!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
Why are you so curious about our retrofits all of a sudden, San Diego?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">San Diego：</span><br>
Ahaha... I dunno! I'm interested in them, I guess!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
In that case, I think there's something you should know, San Diego! A retrofit is a big commitment, it's not merely a change of uniform!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">San Diego：</span><br>
Huh...? What's a "commute mint"?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
You need the persistence to study diligently every day, the resolve to always aspire for greater things, and – lastly – good timing! Once you have all of that, you may receive the chance for a retrofit!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">San Diego：</span><br>
Me neither!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin & Ayanami & Laffey：</span><br>
Me neither!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
It certainly i– Wait, am I really the only one who worked so hard?!<br>
<br>
And so, with the help of Z23 and company, San Diego had acquired a deeper understanding of the concept of retrofitting. Perhaps this knowledge would eventually lead to a retrofit of her own.<br>

Chapter 3: When In Doubt, Ask a Friend<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">San Diego：</span><br>
I feel like I kinda get it, but I don't really...<br>
What the heck do you do to get retrofitted...<br>
Well, I'm a genius with a 4-digit IQ, so I'll probably understand in due time!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">???：</span><br>
Zzzzz...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">San Diego：</span><br>
Hey, who's that behind the tree over there?<br>
Oh! HEEEEY, NICHOLAAAAAS!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nicholas：</span><br>
WAAAAGH?! Jeebus, what was that?! An earthquake, an airhorn, or both?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">San Diego：</span><br>
Nope, just me, San Diego!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nicholas：</span><br>
Good gosh... You nearly gave me a heart attack...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">San Diego：</span><br>
Maybe for Christmas! By the way, is it just me or have you grown a bit?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nicholas：</span><br>
Have I? Maybe... I sleep all the time... so that could be why...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">San Diego：</span><br>
Hold up, you can get a retrofit just by sleeping?! I need to write this down!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nicholas：</span><br>
(Don't think it works that way, but I can't be bothered to explain it...) Yup, worked for me...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hammann：</span><br>
No, that's not how it works!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">San Diego：</span><br>
Heyo, Hammann!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hammann：</span><br>
Let me tell you: to get MY retrofit, I had to work my butt off while everyone stood by and stared at me!<br>
All because I was stupid and wanted to be more useful to the Commander...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">San Diego：</span><br>
Useful to the Commander?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hammann：</span><br>
N-never mind, it doesn't matter! What I'm saying is: you want a retrofit? Then work hard for it! It won't just fall into your lap!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">San Diego：</span><br>
Oh, okay! I think I'm starting to get it now!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nicholas：</span><br>
If that's all, then I'm going back to sleep now... Good night, or morning, or whatever it is... Zzzzz...<br>
<br>
And so, San Diego felt like she had adopted the right mindset to receive a retrofit. Perhaps her goal was just within reach, and all she had to do was keep advancing.<br>

Chapter 4: One Battle Star to Another<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
Let's see, the next exercise should be starting in... Hm?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">San Diego：</span><br>
Howdy do, Enterprise, old pal!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
Oh, it's you, San Diego. Always nice to see you so upbeat.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">San Diego：</span><br>
Upbeat is my middle name~! You gotta be beaming with energy all day or else your brain'll turn to mush, you know!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
I suppose. You can never have too much stamina.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">San Diego：</span><br>
(Staring intently)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
... What? Is there something on my face?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">San Diego：</span><br>
You don't have a retrofit, yet you've got that aura thingy like it!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
Retrofit...? Ah, right, heard you've been going around and asking everyone about it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">San Diego：</span><br>
I'm learning things~! See, I spotted all these people with retrofits and had no clue what they were, so it got me curious!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
Not every day you see that... You devoting all your focus to one thing, I mean.<br>
I'm not sure why you're so curious, but my advice to you is to take in things at your own pace and you'll understand them eventually.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">San Diego：</span><br>
My own pace?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
Yeah. Everybody learns new things and grow as people every day. How they do it differs from person to person.<br>
Retrofitting is the same. Don't think too much about everyone else's, focus on what you want yours to be, and you'll surely break free of your personal limits one day.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">San Diego：</span><br>
W-wow... I'm kinda dumbstruck, but it feels like you just gave the best motivational speech I've ever heard!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
Glad to help someone second only to me in battle stars. Good luck with your goal, San Diego. I believe in you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">San Diego：</span><br>
Wow, I'm feeling super-duper motivated now! It... it almost feels like I could retrofit right here, right now!<br>
<br>
