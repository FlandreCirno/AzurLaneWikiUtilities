A Date With Atago<br>
<br>
Chapter 1: A Date Invitation<br>
Port - Command Office<br>
One of the many responsibilities expected of the Commander and secretary are to be on duty.<br>
This is a system that, in times of emergency, allows commanding officers to stay overnight at the base to avoid having to commute, but...<br>
If called in during a day off, the regulations simply require that "the commander and the secretary must perform joint activities over the course of two days." Because of that...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Atago：</span><br>
Commander? It's already midnight, shouldn't you consider going to sleep?<br>
You're off duty tomorrow, so just focus on resting. Let me handle the night shift.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Bring up the "date" for tomorrow that Atago mentioned.</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Atago：</span><br>
Oh my, a date? That was a joke, you know~<br>
Don't you think your whole "please accompany me to go shopping as part of our joint activities" was a bit too bland? Your big sister wanted to hear something a bit spicier~<br>
Since we don't have anything to do tomorrow, I wouldn't mind staying with you as long as you'd like, you know~?<br>
So, what do you need to buy?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Show her your shopping list</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Atago：</span><br>
Hmm, I suppose this is one of the few things that you can't get here, but also would be too much of a hassle to order online...<br>
Since you've done your homework so thoroughly, your big sister will feel safe being escorted~<br>
All right, let's go nice and early in the morning, so you should probably sleep soon.<br>
I'm looking forward to our little outing~♪<br>

<br>
Chapter 2: Let's Go!<br>
Next Morning -<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Atago：</span><br>
Ah, good morning, Commander. You're up early today.<br>
You're half an hour early, you know? Could it be... you thought that your big sister would be waiting for you wistfully?<br>
You'd be getting a little ahead of yourself~ The reason I came so early was... look over there.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Takao：</span><br>
Atago? And... Commander? Did you two also come here to carry out morning training?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Atago：</span><br>
Not quite. Ah, before I forget, this is for you.<br>
<br>
Atago took a sports drink out of her bag and passed it to Takao.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Takao：</span><br>
Thank you very much. Ah, Commander, Atago always helps me refuel during my morning training. You could say it's become a routine.<br>
O-of course I refused at first, but she was so insistent...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Atago：</span><br>
Oh my. Who was the one who refused to take even a single sip of water while yelling something like "MY BURNING SPIRIT SHALL SUSTAIN ME" until she finally passed out in the middle of a combat drill?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Takao：</span><br>
...Pfffftt! Ahem... uhh, in any case, are you taking the day off, Commander?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Atago：</span><br>
*giggles* Takao~ aren't you the curious one? Between us girls...<br>
<br>
Atago whispered something into Takao's ear.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Takao：</span><br>
Wh-what!? Commander! E-Even if it's your day off, as a commanding officer, there are some things that are inappropriate!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Atago：</span><br>
Takao, if you want to come along as well, the three of us could do it~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Takao：</span><br>
I shall humbly decline! Goodbye!<br>
<br>
For some reason, Takao was beet red as if she was about to shoot steam from her ears. She quickly sheathed her sword, turned around, and sprinted off.<br>
What in the world did Atago tell her...<br>

<br>
Chapter 3: The Shopping Situation<br>
Outside of Port - Nearby Street<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Atago：</span><br>
It seems like it's been forever since we've been able to shop like this. Commander, how are you doing back there? Can you carry any more?<br>
*giggles* Sorry~ I don't mind carrying stuff, but you know, people will give us weird looks if I'm hauling all those bags around.<br>
Having that said though...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Choukai：</span><br>
Over there... is that Atago? Atagoooo!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Maya：</span><br>
Ugh...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Atago：</span><br>
Oh my, if it isn't Choukai and Maya. Are you two out shopping as well?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Choukai：</span><br>
Yes, we are! We're here to pick out some clothes! Ah, Commander, you're working hard today as well!<br>
By the way, Atago, I heard that a new buffet opened around here not too long ago. After we're all done, we should go check it out together!<br>
In any case, we'll be headed this way... Jeez, Maya, don't just sit there, we've got to head to the next store!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Maya：</span><br>
It's not like I even want to buy anything... OW! Don't pull on me! I'm coming, I'm coming... for god's sake...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Choukai：</span><br>
Sorry for making a scene in front of you~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Atago：</span><br>
It's rare to see Maya this grumpy. Is something the matter?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Choukai：</span><br>
Um, well, when we were at the lingerie shop, there was only one vacant changing room so we had to go in together... The rest is history, I suppose...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Atago：</span><br>
Um... Maya? I know it might be hard for you right now, but your body can always change, you know?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Maya：</span><br>
That may be the case, but... I don't know why I'm like this either...<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Try to cheer Maya up</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Maya：</span><br>
Even if you say that... *sigh* Atago, you probably entered this world with huge ol' knockers on you so that's easy for you to say...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Atago：</span><br>
The hell did you just say...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Maya：</span><br>
Um, n-nothing at all! C'mon, Choukai, let's bounce!<br>
<br>
The two of them hastily beat their retreat.<br>

A Date With Atago<br>
<br>
Chapter 4: Rest Break, and then...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Atago：</span><br>
Everything on the shopping list is checked off, and we've even had lunch. Wouldn't you say our day has gone pretty smoothly?<br>
*giggles* You look like you're not ready to head back just yet. It's written all over your face. Is there anywhere you'd still like to go?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Let Atago decide</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Atago：</span><br>
Didn't I say that you'd be escorting me today? That's going to cost you fifty points.<br>
But that's just talk... to be honest, there is somewhere I'd like to go. You wouldn't mind... following me for a little, would you?<br>
Here, take this ticket. Sorry for making you run around so much today.<br>
<br>
After following her around for a while, we amazingly ended up in front of a movie theater...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Atago：</span><br>
Ahh, this movie sure brings back memories~ Did you know that your big sister actually likes sappy romance flicks like this one~<br>
Um... I didn't buy the wrong tickets... did I...?<br>
<br>
I examined the ticket closely. Printed ominously underneath the title were the words, "GENRE: HORROR"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Atago：</span><br>
W-well... I suppose this makes for a nice change in pace. Commander, it's about to start~<br>
As for our seats... here, you can lean against me. If you get scared, you can always hug your big sister nice and tight~<br>
If you absolutely can't handle it anymore, we can leave. After all, I was the one who dragged you here...<br>
You don't have to be stubborn like Takao. If you have something to say, just let your big sister know, okay?<br>
<br>
It might have just been my imagination, but Atago's smile looked really, really forced.<br>

<br>
Chapter 5: Engulfed by Darkness<br>
(Clatter... clatter... clatter...)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Atago：</span><br>
..................<br>
<br>
(BANGBANGBANGBANGBANG!!)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Atago：</span><br>
..................<br>
<br>
(Silence...)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Atago：</span><br>
..................<br>
<br>
(BWWWAAAAAARRRRRRRRRGGGGHHHH!!!)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Atago：</span><br>
! ! ! ! !<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Yowwwwch!!</span>'''''<br>
<br>
Suddenly, Atago clamped down onto my hand, hard.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Atago：</span><br>
*shudders*<br>
<br>
When I turned to look, I saw Atago burying her face in my arm, silently trembling.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Squeeze her hand back</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：Pull her in for a hug</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Atago：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''...!<br>
<br>
In response, her grip became even tighter.<br>
The things happening on the screen seemed to fade into the background. We could feel each others' temperature swell through our tightly clasped hands.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Atago：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Commander...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Atago：</span><br>
Um... I'm not scared... I'm not scared anymore...<br>
<br>
Sometimes stalwart, and sometimes seductive, Atago was always calm and, until now, had never shown her vulnerable side.<br>
As the movie ended, I could feel her gentle breath against me as she slipped off into slumber, exhausted.<br>
(One hour later...)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Atago：</span><br>
Thanks, for earlier. Even I have, umm, things that I'm not great with...<br>
You know what they say. Nobody's perfect after all.<br>
Your big sis gets pretty close though~ If anything, you should consider yourself lucky for being able to see another side of me~<br>
Oh, but surely you know what happens if a single word of this gets out, right? Except maybe Takao...<br>
<br>
Atago seemed to slowly be returning to her usual self.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Atago：</span><br>
Commander, only you know about our little secret. Make sure to treasure it, okay? Hehe~<br>

A Date With Atago<br>
<br>
Chapter 6: An Evening Present<br>
A Hill Overlooking the Port<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Atago：</span><br>
Commander, thanks for everything today.<br>
Even though some unexpected things happened, your big sister is still pretty happy~<br>
Commander, what did you think of our date? Did you have fun?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Yes, it was a lot of fun</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Atago：</span><br>
*giggles* Thank you. By the way, isn't the ocean beautiful tonight?<br>
Sometimes, I lose sight of what I'm fighting for. But when I come here and look out over the ocean, I'm reminded once again.<br>
After all... I'm fighting for what I want the most.<br>
... at least, I'm now convinced of that fact.<br>
I believe that as long as we live, we should never lose sight of our goals.<br>
Once you've decided on a goal, you have to see it through, no matter what. Even if that path might lead you to destruction, you have to keep pushing forward.<br>
The day you turn around is the day that you lose all momentum to keep moving forward. Even though I might not look the part, I'm actually a very persistent person.<br>
<br>
You're right, sometimes I find myself forgetting about my purpose as well.<br>
Connecting the hearts of everyone who has made their way here to this port, bridging the gaps between many different cultures and beliefs...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Atago：</span><br>
After tonight, you'll be going back to your usual routine.<br>
And I might not be your secretary anymore tomorrow. You'll have a chance to make bonds with someone else.<br>
So, before that happens...<br>
That's why I'd like a present... the thing that I want most.<br>

A Date With Atago<br>
<br>
Chapter 7: Advance Bravely!<br>
Back then, if our flagship was still there, unflagging and decisive...<br>
Even if the path would have been fraught with sacrifices,<br>
I would have continued to advance bravely until the final moment, never looking back.<br>
That's why this time, I...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Atago：</span><br>
The thing that I want most is you, Commander.<br>
Even though I understand that I will never be able to make you mine, as much as I'd like to.<br>
But this is your big sister's personality, as you should know by now.<br>
<br>
My vision went dark, and then I felt a warm, soft sensation press against me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Atago：</span><br>
Mmh, I didn't say it had to be today.<br>
As long as you promise to answer my feelings one day, even if it's at the very end... when my battle ends.<br>
For that moment, I can do anything, and wait as long as it takes.<br>
For you to belong to me, Commander... I can continue fighting, and overcome any obstacle.<br>
<br>
At that moment, it became clear to me. This was not craze or obsession. For Atago, this was her raison d'etre, the thing that gave her the will to survive another day, nothing more.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Atago：</span><br>
So, let me say it again...<br>
Hey, Commander, become mine, and mine alone. Just listen to me, you won't have to think about anything else...<br>
Because this time, I'm definitely not letting you go~♪<br>
