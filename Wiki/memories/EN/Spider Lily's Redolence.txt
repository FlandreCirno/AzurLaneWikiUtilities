<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Littorio：</span><br>
My friends, raise your glasses!<br>
A toast! To our glorious diplomatic achievement!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
Salute!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sardegnians：</span><br>
Salute!<br>
<br>
With the Arbiter's plans in the Antarctic foiled, today's meeting had greater zeal than usual.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
Thanks to everyone's efforts with the Commander, discussions regarding our reunification have been going smoothly.<br>
Brightest among our achievements of late has been the signing of a treaty between our Sardegna and the Iris.<br>
For helping us show the other factions not just our authority, but our diplomatic capabilities...<br>
I must thank you all once again.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Littorio：</span><br>
No matter how the situation changes, Sardegna can respond flexibly and smoothly.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Duca degli Abruzzi：</span><br>
Let us not forget that it's also the first diplomatic agreement of a unified Iris. That's no small matter to them.<br>
Why did they choose Sardegna for such an important milestone?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Impero：</span><br>
Obviously they see the potential of the Sardegna Empire. I mean, look at us.<br>
Ever since the World Expo, our shipgirls have been center stage in world events. Sardegna's influence is rising like never before.<br>
Good things are gonna happen.<br>
We might just end up with a major voice in the new Azur Lane.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
That's right. And we couldn't have done it without you all.<br>
Know that this is only the beginning. Let's endeavor for the future of our dear nation.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Littorio：</span><br>
But of course. Ahahahaha!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
Another toast to our achievements.<br>
For the glory of our great nation, salute!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Littorio：</span><br>
Salute!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sardegnians：</span><br>
Salute!<br>

Mirror Sea - Camelot White Rose Block<br>
A place once home to only pristine forest has been transformed into a majestic structure.<br>
This building, with walls as white as those of Camelot Castle, serves various functions.<br>
The tower-like passage that pierced the sky serves as the core of this block, with an eye-catching exterior to match.<br>
With this passage, Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth and a chosen few could travel anywhere within its reach without being noticed by prying eyes.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Vampire META：</span><br>
So this is Test Site Beta.<br>
No wonder they call it the White Rose Block. There are white roses all over the place!<br>
It hasn't even been that long, but things are progressing fast.<br>
But if I were to stay here forever...<br>
I'd need them to build me a Sleepless City block♪<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Erebus META：</span><br>
...That won't be happening.<br>
If we were free to make demands, then I'd sooner have my own underworld.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Hunter META：</span><br>
This isn't a vacation. Leave it.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Vampire META：</span><br>
Boooring. It might as well be a vacation!<br>
Teaching girls how to fight, upgrading equipment, joining their training drills...<br>
It's all so unfulfilling.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Hunter META：</span><br>
...This branch has powerful shipgirls, too.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Vampire META：</span><br>
Powerful shipgirls... Oh. You mean those two girls Sheffield knows?<br>
No wonder they refused—<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Erebus META：</span><br>
That's confidential. I hope you haven't forgotten.<br>
Try not to get people killed so soon after our arrival.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Vampire META：</span><br>
Oh. Now that you mention it, yeah.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Erebus META：</span><br>
*sigh*... That's enough chit-chat. Our contact is here, so try not to embarrass us.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hood：</span><br>
Welcome to the Gate of Avalon, dearest allies.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Erebus META：</span><br>
I didn't think you'd bother coming out to greet us. It's an honor to meet you, Miss Hood.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Vampire META：</span><br>
Greetings~ Wow, what an interesting girl you brought along today.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vampire：</span><br>
Hmm. Another who walks in darkness?<br>
Thou art Vampire, too, I presume?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Vampire META：</span><br>
Yep!♪ Got a problem with it?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vampire：</span><br>
Of course not. In fact, it's just perfect.<br>
I might just want rigging like thine own!<br>
Tell me, how didst thou become a META?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Vampire META：</span><br>
You don't think I'd tell you for free, do you? It's our biggest secret.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vampire：</span><br>
...Then how much must I pay?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Vampire META：</span><br>
Let me think about it~<br>
How about trading it for something I want to know?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hood：</span><br>
Heheheh. Things are already taking a lively turn.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Hunter META：</span><br>
Already negotiating?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Newcastle：</span><br>
Miss Hood, it's almost time...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hood：</span><br>
That's right. Thank you, Newcastle.<br>
Everyone, you're just in time for tea. We'd love if you were willing to join us.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Vampire META：</span><br>
Sounds good~ I want... raspberry ice cream with extra blood!<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Hunter META：</span><br>
She's already ordering...<br>
Erebus, I don't know if we should be this carefree.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Erebus META：</span><br>
...There's nothing wrong with things being peaceful.<br>
Relax a little... Yeah, I think it wouldn't hurt.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hood：</span><br>
Haha, things are finally getting lively here for once.<br>

<br>
Dragon Empery - ???<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Harbin：</span><br>
"The Vermilion Bird falls from the heavens." Something's going to happen in the south... Huan Ch'ang's divination is already half confirmed.<br>
Man, she's something else.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chi An：</span><br>
No kidding. Things in the Antarctic have gotten extremely dangerous.<br>
Siren hordes are going there from all directions. It must be because of the danger Observer's mainframe is in.<br>
Some seem to be building a defensive line around a portion of Antarctica.<br>
The battle in Antarctica rages on.<br>
But it's difficult to get a read on such a hectic battle...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yat Sen：</span><br>
Fortunately, the Commander has withdrawn all allies from Antarctica and the research station.<br>
Currently, the Royal Navy, Eagle Union, and Iron Blood are monitoring the Sirens' defensive line.<br>
I'd love to see the Sirens take themselves out at this rate, but pipe dreams aside... If the battle did spill out of the area, they'd surely take care of it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">An Shan：</span><br>
Antarctica has been peaceful for so long. What could have caused this sudden violence?<br>
Our plans to build a research station will have to be postponed indefinitely...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yat Sen：</span><br>
We have no choice.<br>
Besides, the Antarctic isn't an anomaly. Siren activity has increased all over the world.<br>
Even in areas we've taken back from the Sirens, their patrols have been spotted again.<br>
This is true of the NA Sea, too, even after Compiler's mainframe was destroyed.<br>
They don't seem to be new models of Sirens, but they clearly work in unison.<br>
They don't just evade battle. When forced to fight, they act in entirely different ways from before.<br>
It's as if they're being controlled by an invisible command unit...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">An Shan：</span><br>
Do you think... Compiler's been rebuilt?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yat Sen：</span><br>
That is feasible, but we have no witness testimony to back that up yet.<br>
Observer and the other high-level Sirens have obscured their whereabouts, as well.<br>
The only Siren forces appearing in the world's seas are pawns, mass-produced fleets, and lower-level enforcers.<br>
Our staff believe that the disappearance of high-level Sirens is the result of them focusing their forces in the Antarctic.<br>
While it is possible that Compiler will return, we find it more likely that Observer has ceded control to another Siren.<br>
For example, focusing herself on the fight with Gazers in the Antarctic while leaving the rest to another higher-level Arbiter...<br>
Arbiters are no monolith. The Commander witnessed as much in the NA Sea.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">An Shan：</span><br>
You have a point...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Harbin：</span><br>
Those Arbiters are already bad enough, and you're telling me there's one who can control all the Sirens in the world on her own?<br>
Arbiters are one hell of an enemy...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yat Sen：</span><br>
We have word that a large quantity of Siren patrols have gathered outside the storm as well.<br>
They seem to be planning something with the knowledge that we're analyzing said storm.<br>
The other half of Huan Ch'ang's divination... This is sure to be another handful.<br>
Things may get even worse than they have in the Antarctic.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Harbin：</span><br>
Now I get it. You called me and An Shan here for a new mission, didn't you?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yat Sen：</span><br>
That's right. The situation has changed, so your current mission has been suspended.<br>
I'll need you to rendezvous with Chi An's storm analysis team.<br>
Also, An Shan, you've been given permission regarding the other matter.<br>
You may use your advanced equipment at your discretion in case of emergency.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chi An：</span><br>
Good luck out there, everyone♪<br>

Somewhere in the Iris Orthodoxy<br>
In a small town, divorced from the hustle and bustle of the big city...<br>
A quiet, peaceful place teeming with nature...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sheffield：</span><br>
No unusual radio waves, no secret underground rooms, and no signs of suspicious folk.<br>
Likewise here.<br>
Tch... It's such a pain to work without clues. My only option is to comb the entire place.<br>
...Still, I can't help but notice how friendly Master has gotten with Cardinal Richelieu's entourage of late.<br>
Did she get a hold of your weaknesses? Or did you let a secret slip?<br>
Either way, I need to find the cause immediately.<br>
Clemenceau is a dangerous woman. If you're not careful, you may end up her prey – possibly in more ways than one.<br>
...Hm?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Joffre：</span><br>
If it isn't Sheffield of the Royal Navy. Fancy meeting you here.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sheffield：</span><br>
Joffre... Angel of the Tribunal.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Joffre：</span><br>
As I understand, you're responsible for guarding the Royal Navy's representatives.<br>
What could possibly bring you out to this town?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sheffield：</span><br>
Well, the Tribunal's venue security is perfect. It left me without any work to do.<br>
So I thought I'd sightsee and make full use of my per-diem allowance.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Joffre：</span><br>
Well, thank you for your appraisal of our security.<br>
However... Abandoning your post is hardly noble.<br>
Of course, the Tribunal and I don't mean to spoil our guests' fun. Especially not when they're clearly so interested in our attractions.<br>
Out of deference to the blessed Iris for uniting us on this day, I'll show you my favorite attraction.<br>
Come, come. Right this way.<br>

Sakura Empire - Mikasa's Residence<br>
Zuikaku sat on a bench near the manse's gate and thought to herself.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
I can't get in contact with Mikasa, Lady Nagato, or Shoukaku...<br>
I get it if they're out on urgent business, but EVERYONE can't possibly be missing at once, right?<br>
The lights are on inside, so there should be someone...<br>
Hm?<br>
I didn't notice before because I was in such a hurry, but did Mikasa... repaint the exterior?<br>
Huh? Was this path in such poor condition before?<br>
And those stalls over there... weren't there last time I came here...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">???：</span><br>
I'm sorry, big sister...! It took too long to clean up!<br>
Oh, I'm gonna be late... Mikasa's going to lecture me, too...<br>
Heehee. It's okay.<br>
If we're going to be late either way, let's take things slowly. Safety first, you know.<br>
Haste makes waste. And what a waste it would be if you ruined your makeup in your hurry.<br>
<br>
While Zuikaku watched on vacantly, she heard familiar voices.<br>
She turned toward the voices and saw two figures in red on the street corner.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Those voices... That can't be, but...<br>
Could it be?<br>
Heeey! Wait!<br>
<br>
She stood up and ran to the street corner, but then –<br>
*CRASH!*<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Ouch...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">???：</span><br>
Hm? You okay?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
Well, if it isn't Zuikaku. What's got you in such a hurry?<br>
Are you lost? No wonder I couldn't find you anywhere...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Mikasa?!<br>
Wh-why are you here?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
Uh, what? You were planning to come home today, weren't you? I'm here to pick you up.<br>
The roads here are poorly maintained these days. Can't blame ya for getting lost.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Are you saying you've been waiting here all this time...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
Sure have.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
(Weird... I didn't see Mikasa on my way through here before.)<br>
(Wait, everything around me is different!)<br>
(The walls, the road, the stalls...)<br>
(Is this... a dream?)<br>
(.........)<br>
(No, no. It can't be! I'm not how I used to be!)<br>
(I went through that Tower of Midgard stuff, after all!)<br>
(Does that mean... this is some kind of new mental attack?)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
Zuikaku? You look pale. Is something wrong?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Mikasa, where are Lady Nagato and Shoukaku?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikasa：</span><br>
They're all waiting for you at the house.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Thank goodness... Let's go home, Mikasa!<br>
It's embarrassing, but I just had this weird experience...<br>
I want to tell you all about it!<br>

{{折叠面板|标题=The Queens' Teatime|选项=6|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<br>
??? - ???<br>
In a luxurious reception room, two queens enjoyed a comfortable and graceful teatime together.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Heehee... Our detectives never cease to amaze.<br>
The times may change, but Scotland Yard certainly doesn't...<br>
Ugh, take your jobs a little more seriously!<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
Right?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
To think that this is how I finally get to see the rest...<br>
Do you always get testing data through such books and newspapers?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
Isn't it a lovely method?<br>
Not only does it minimize interference in the testing sites...<br>
But it also takes no time at all. And it's fun, to boot!<br>
Besides, every tea party needs a newspaper, no?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
I must agree with that.<br>
Hah, look at this article! A robber tried to rob a weapons store!<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
Pfft... And how did that turn out?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Let's see... The robber was arrested, and nobody was hurt in the end.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
Unsurprising...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Strange Machine：</span><br>
DING DONG! DING DONG!<br>
BANG BANG! DA DA DUM!<br>
<br>
Odd noises suddenly ruined the calm atmosphere in the reception room.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Strange Machine：</span><br>
TARGET SPOTTED! GATHER AT ONCE!<br>
BEEP BEEP! BEEP BEEP!<br>
TARGET SPOTTED! GATHER AT ONCE!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
.........<br>
.........?<br>
Come again?<br>
<br>
Elizabeth looked around her until she found a plushie on the corner of the couch. Said plushie was flashing and making all the noise.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
...What is this?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
A gift from Ms. D. It seems she's pinpointed the location of her next hunt.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Is this... handmade?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
It certainly is.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
It's, umm... very cute...?<br>
It has the air of a person.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
That is Ms. D. Do you feel you've reached a deeper understanding now?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
.........<br>
...How scary.<br>

Sakura Emp■■ - ■■■■<br>
■■■■Flower-Viewing<br>
Akagi<br>
Akagi and Amagi walked together on a stony path lined with trees.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Akagi, I can already see it!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi：</span><br>
The flower-viewing has already begun...<br>
There's still space, though. I don't think we're too late at all.<br>
Apologies for keeping you all waiting.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
We're really sorry for making you wait so long!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kamikaze：</span><br>
See? I told you Amagi wouldn't miss this.<br>
You lose, Naka. Your snacks are mine!☆<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jintsuu：</span><br>
I told you not to take that bet. Hahaha!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Naka：</span><br>
Uuugh... Just take it all...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:89}：</span><br>
Amagi, Akagi. Thank you for coming to today's flower-viewing event.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi：</span><br>
Oh, please. We should be the ones to thank you for waiting for us, Houshou.<br>
Incidentally, I don't see Miss Mikasa around... Is she not here yet?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:89}：</span><br>
She was summoned to an emergency meeting on her way here.<br>
Here I thought maybe you had been delayed for the same reason...<br>
Did you run into any unexpected incidents along the way?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi：</span><br>
Well...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kaga(BB)：</span><br>
It was obviously that little sister of hers that delayed her.<br>
I heard she was needy, but this is something else.<br>
You're lucky Mikasa isn't here, or she'd lecture you over your irresponsibility in front of the whole group.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Kaga!<br>
Hmph. I was wondering who that greying old lady was. If it isn't Kaga!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kaga(BB)：</span><br>
Of course I'm here. I was invited.<br>
But you weren't, were you? You just got to tag along because big sister's a big shot, isn't that right?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Aww, look who got invited? Big deal! Back me up, Tosa.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tosa：</span><br>
...I'd appreciate if you didn't get bystanders wrapped up in this silly argument, thank you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kaga(BB)：</span><br>
You don't see us for a few days, and you grow up to have such a big mouth.<br>
Remember, all you are is that damn –<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi：</span><br>
Hmmm?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kaga(BB)：</span><br>
D-damn... damn smart Amagi's pupil!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi：</span><br>
Now, now, I think that's enough talk. Would you allow us to sit now, Kaga?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kaga(BB)：</span><br>
...Why are you asking me? I don't care what you do.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi：</span><br>
Heehee.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Pffbbft!<br>
<br>
After blowing raspberries at Kaga, Akagi followed Amagi to their seats.<br>
Her tail wagged all the way – a symbol of her triumph.<br>
Upon sitting, Akagi realized that she was in a sea of flowers.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi?：</span><br>
I picked a flower for you on the way here.<br>
Look, Akagi. What do you think this one is called?<br>
<br>
Amagi showed her a flower of deep, bloody crimson.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Red spider lily...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi?：</span><br>
Correct.<br>
Gorgeous, bewitching, magnificent, yet poisonous.<br>
Just like you...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Just like... me?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi?：</span><br>
Let these flowers bloom all over the world. See their petals light the world ablaze in crimson.<br>
My dear sister...<br>
