<br>
Chapter 1: The Outset<br>
Port - Office<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Deutschland：</span><br>
Slave! I'm bored.<br>
I accepted the secretary position expecting it to be interesting, but all I do is sit locked up in this tiny office of yours.<br>
And you, lowly slave, dare ignore your master and process those documents without speaking a word to me?<br>
Find some way of entertaining me, or I'm leaving! This is an order!<br>
I appointed Deutschland thinking it would appease her, but she's acting the same as always.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："Help me get this work done."</span>'''''<br>
I refuse. A lowly animal isn't worthy of my help.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："I'd appreciate it if you'd help me."</span>'''''<br>
Plead all you want, it won't do you any good!<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："Please, master, I humbly beg for your assistance!"</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Deutschland：</span><br>
... Hmph! What a helpless dog you are, begging your own master for help!<br>
But since you're so loyal and I'm so benevolent, I'll hear you out and help with your work!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Juno：</span><br>
Umm... Commander?<br>
I'm here to deliver the mission report...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Deutschland：</span><br>
......<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Juno：</span><br>
N-now then, if you don't have any new orders for me, I will take my leave...<br>
<br>
I wanted to thank Juno, but she left my office in a hurry before I could even say anything.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Deutschland：</span><br>
Ahahahahah! Did you see that, slave? The look of fear in that destroyer's eyes?!<br>
Ahh, it was incredible! I want to see that again!<br>
If it means I get to feast upon that sight every day, then fine! I'll remain your secretary!<br>
<br>
It seems she's found a way to enjoy herself as the secretary.<br>
But I think someone has to do something about that mindset of hers...<br>

Chapter 2: True Nobility<br>
Deutschland and I were on a stroll around the port, and that's when we came across...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Bel, why do I need to attend today's exercise?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Belfast：</span><br>
Because you have been assigned to the exercise fleet for the time being, Your Majesty.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
I'm not in the mood for it today! Have Warspite do it in my stead!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Belfast：</span><br>
Your Majesty, please, you must not be selfish.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Deutschland：</span><br>
How interesting, the queen of the Royal Navy is being lectured by one of her own servants! An Iron Blood leader would never be lectured by her servant!<br>
Ah, is that Gneisenau over there? Perfect. Slave, stay here and watch this!<br>
Hey, Gneisenau!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gneisenau：</span><br>
Hello there, Deutschland. Do you need anything?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Deutschland：</span><br>
I don't want to do that exercise tomorrow. Get someone else to do it for me!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gneisenau：</span><br>
... Very well, that won't be an issue. I will inform Tirpitz that we're changing the composition of our exercise fleet.<br>
Now then, if you'll excuse me...<br>
<br>
Gneisenau left the scene to convey Deutschland's wishes.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Deutschland：</span><br>
Ahahahahah! See, slave? That's the level of authority I have!<br>
<br>
I have this hunch like Gneisenau isn't so much obedient to her, rather she just doesn't think Deutschland's attendance is required...<br>
Her response gives me the impression that she's long since gotten used to Deutschland's arrogant attitude.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Deutschland：</span><br>
This is yet more proof of the fact that I'm Iron Blood's most respected spiritual leader!<br>
<br>
... But I suppose there's nothing really wrong with that.<br>

Chapter 3: Dissonance<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">London：</span><br>
I shall now announce the exercise winners in descending order of performance.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Deutschland：</span><br>
Listen closely, slave. Wait for the moment my name, Deutschland – the most magnificent armored ship in the world – is read aloud!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">London：</span><br>
Fifth place: Rodney.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Deutschland：</span><br>
... Hmph, I was out of shape today. But no matter, the Big Seven are a class of their own, but I would never fall short to any other battleship type...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">London：</span><br>
Thirteenth place: Queen Elizabeth.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Deutschland：</span><br>
... Grrrr...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">London：</span><br>
Twentieth place: Takao. Takao is the sole heavy cruiser that made it to the top 20 for this exercise. Let's give her a round of applause.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Deutschland：</span><br>
Not so fast! What about me?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">London：</span><br>
Ah, Deutschland, let's see...<br>
You were faster than all others in the moving target shelling category, but there is room for improvement in your accuracy and firing posture.<br>
In my opinion, you could use some more training.<br>
<br>
London continues reading out names where she left off.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Deutschland：</span><br>
Training is for dogs and circus animals! I'm perfect, I don't need to train...<br>
I don't... need to...<br>
Slave! I'm more powerful than anyone, aren't I?! Yes, I'm just in bad shape today! That's all it is, right?!<br>
She's on the brink of tears. I'd better...<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Say nothing.</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：Flatter her so she'll calm down.</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Deutschland：</span><br>
So that's how it is... Now I see...<br>
I'm not actually powerful at all... Everyone's just been playing one big trick on me...<br>
Ahah, eheheh, hahahahaha...<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Call out to her.</span>'''''<br>
<br>
She looks depressed as she runs off on her own somewhere without answering my call, like she didn't even hear me.<br>

<br>
Chapter 4: Devastated<br>
Office work hours have begun but Deutschland still hasn't shown up, so I decided to head to the Iron Blood dorm to look for her.<br>
Iron Blood Dormitory<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Deutschland：</span><br>
You're here, slave? What do you want?<br>
<br>
I opened the door to Deutschland's room to find her all by herself, huddled up in a corner.<br>
Now I'm worried about her...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Deutschland：</span><br>
You need a secretary? Get someone else to do it then...<br>
Just leave me alone. I'm no use to you anyway...<br>
I'm such an idiot. Everyone around me thinks I'm a clown, and I never even realized it.<br>
They say I'm powerful, which makes me think I actually am, until I'm convinced I'm superior to everyone and act high and mighty...<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Pat her on the head.</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Deutschland：</span><br>
... She brushed my hand away.<br>
Don't touch me!<br>
I've slowly realized something ever since I came here. I'm not like the girls from the other factions.<br>
I'm different...<br>
And you're like them. You made me your secretary just so you could laugh at me when I screw up, didn't you?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："Of course not."</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Deutschland：</span><br>
Of course you'd lie...<br>
<br>
I don't think she'll listen to anything I say in her current state.<br>
It looks like I'll have to ask her fellow fleet members what happened.<br>

Chapter 5: The Truth, Pt. 1<br>
Gneisenau's Room<br>
I somehow managed to drag Deutschland out of her room and decided to ask her Iron Blood comrades about the situation.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gneisenau：</span><br>
I had a feeling this would happen eventually, and it seems my hunch was correct.<br>
I'm sorry, Deutschland. But please believe me when I say nobody meant to hurt you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Deutschland：</span><br>
You expect me to believe that?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gneisenau：</span><br>
Oh, right... You don't know the story behind all this, Commander.<br>
That being the case, I'll call over the girls relevant to this discussion and tell them about this. You and Deutschland can sit in the next room over and listen.<br>
<br>
Port - Dormitory Salon<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gneisenau：</span><br>
Thank you for coming, Eugen, Spee, Tirpitz, and Z1. I have something to tell you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Admiral Graf Spee：</span><br>
It's about... Deutschland, isn't it?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gneisenau：</span><br>
Correct. A long time ago, we all entered an agreement to go along with her egotistic tendencies so she could live a happy life.<br>
I'm sure you all remember this, yes?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Deutschland：</span><br>
They what?! I can't just sit here and listen to this...!<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Hold Deutschland back before she storms out of the room.</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Deutschland：</span><br>
Let go of me!<br>
<br>
... She bit my arm.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Deutschland：</span><br>
Stop it, you insubordinate, lowly animal...!<br>
Mrgh... Gah...!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Yeah, I remember that... I've grown used to her attitude by now, so I don't really need to be bound by that agreement anymore.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tirpitz：</span><br>
I know it's for her sake, but it's a fact that what we've done isn't right.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gneisenau：</span><br>
Indeed. It's also caused trouble for other people. Furthermore, Deutschland knows about it now, and she feels really hurt by it.<br>
That is why I've called you here - so we can discuss what to do next.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Deutschland：</span><br>
......<br>
They'll just keep making a fool of me. I know they will.<br>
(Whispering) Slave... what should I do...?<br>

<br>
Chapter 6: The Truth, Pt. 2<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tirpitz：</span><br>
It's all because of that name... "Lützow."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gneisenau：</span><br>
Indeed. I don't know how it came to be, but she isn't just Deutschland of the Iron Blood, she was also born as Lützow of the Northern Parliament.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Deutschland：</span><br>
Huh?! How do they know that...?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gneisenau：</span><br>
And not the Lützow who fought in the Great War, the one the Northern Parliament refloated...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Her history haunts her. So she tried desperately to make herself out as the ideal image of Iron Blood so we'd accept her.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Deutschland：</span><br>
... Why would she bring this up now...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leberecht Maass (Z1)：</span><br>
Sure, she had a thing with the Northern Parliament, but she's still Deutschland. She's one of us.<br>
And we wanted to make her feel like a part of the team, but since she's kinda sensitive, we agreed to be nice to her.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Deutschland：</span><br>
......……<br>
<br>
So basically, they were simply doing their best not to hurt or upset her.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gneisenau：</span><br>
Which is why we kept this a secret from her and accepted her into the Iron Blood.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tirpitz：</span><br>
That's right. Above all else, she is one of us. But ironically, all our cautiousness and special treatment wound up hurting her in the end...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leberecht Maass (Z1)：</span><br>
I think she's fine the way she is right now... but I guess she should come to terms with herself, at least a little.<br>
It might leave her feeling blue for a while, but maybe we should tell her the truth?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
I say we do. It's a shame to lose the arrogant Deutschland we know, but it's time she accepts herself for who she is.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Deutschland：</span><br>
So... they pretty much admit they lied to me...<br>
<br>
Deutschland whispers while her shoulders tremble. Her voice lacks its signature impactful tone, instead sounding frail.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Deutschland：</span><br>
... Slave, let me go.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gneisenau：</span><br>
In conclusion, we should tell Deutschland the truth.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Admiral Graf Spee：</span><br>
But how do we go about telling her that...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
We don't need to do anything. Right, Gneisenau?<br>
<br>
I let go of Deutschland. She walks over to open the door, then steps into the salon.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gneisenau：</span><br>
... Ah, so you knew she was listening, Eugen.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Heheh, of course I knew. So, what do you plan to do with us, Deutschland?<br>
<br>
After a brief silence, the girl raises her voice and speaks her mind.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Deutschland：</span><br>
You will pay dearly for deceiving me for so long.<br>
But... I also want to say...<br>
Thank you... for accepting me.<br>

Chapter 7: Some Things Never Change<br>
It's been some time after the truth about Deutschland came to light...<br>
Port - Exercise Area<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Scharnhorst：</span><br>
Aaaand I win again! Hah!<br>
Ready to accept your loss yet, Deutschland?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Deutschland：</span><br>
Grr... No! It's not over yet!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Scharnhorst：</span><br>
Hah, that's the spirit! Your gear is one thing, but what you need is experience. And if you wanna scuffle with the best, you'll have to train like the rest!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Deutschland：</span><br>
Tsk! I know that, stop repeating it!<br>
<br>
Port - Office<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Deutschland：</span><br>
Here, slave. This is how you write a formal document, right?<br>
There are a few minor errors here and there, but I can clearly see she worked hard to make it.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Praise her for her work.</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Deutschland：</span><br>
Tsk. Why should I accept the praises of a miserable slave...<br>
But, I suppose if it's error-free, that's fine.<br>
<br>
Port - Plaza<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mutsuki：</span><br>
Do you have another name, Deutschland?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Deutschland：</span><br>
... I do. My other name is "Lützow."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mikazuki：</span><br>
That sounds cool! Can I call you that?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kisaragi：</span><br>
But Mikazuki, I think she doesn't wanna be called that...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Deutschland：</span><br>
Hmph, address me however you want.<br>
Regardless of what people call me, I will always be me.<br>
<br>
Some time after the truth came to light, Deutschland went back to her normal self.<br>
But once you talk to her for a while, you'll be surprised by how honest with herself and mature she's now become.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Deutschland：</span><br>
I know that look on your face! It's got "Wow, you're so much more honest with yourself" written all over it!<br>
Either that, or your depraved animal mind is having lecherous thoughts again!<br>
Listen, slave! Your duty is to serve me, and you must work hard to be worthy of it!<br>
<br>
One thing hasn't changed, though: she still treats me like her slave...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Deutschland：</span><br>
So stop staring into space and play a game with me! I order you to amuse me~<br>
<br>
But I guess that's fine.<br>
