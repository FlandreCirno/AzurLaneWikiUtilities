Mysterious Rabbit Alien?!<br>
<br>
I 「What is the Rabbit Planet?」<br>
Port area, Command Center<br>
Recently, it’s Bailey’s turn to be the Commander's secretary.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bailey：</span><br>
Is Commander a bit tired today?~ Let Bailey energize you with my bunny power!<br>
Commander, although stockpiling carrots is a good thing, going a mission to stockpile them will not be beneficial.<br>
Commander, you’ve got new mail! Is it from the Rabbit Planet?<br>
<br>
...although Bailey’s appearance doesn’t scream confidence in her ability to handle things, she is full of enthusiasm…<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bailey：</span><br>
I just received a telepathic wave from the Rabbit Alien, they want me to help with the Commander’s work. So Commander, don’t be afraid to call on me for help~<br>
<br>
Exactly what is this… Rabbit Planet?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bailey：</span><br>
What’s wrong Commander? Is there something troubles you?<br>
Hehe, you can tell Bailey. Let Bailey use the wisdom of the Rabbit Planet to help solve your problem!<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Ask Bailey about the Rabbit Planet.</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bailey：</span><br>
Ah, so you all were curious about this.<br>
Hummm~~ How can Bailey explain...Rabbit Planet….is simply a planet full of rabbits!<br>
<br>
What kind of implausible answer is that——<br>

II 「Rabbit Alien Characteristics—— “Rabbit Ears”!」<br>
Port area, Command Center<br>
Although we haven’t figured out exactly what is Rabbit Planet, it’s certainly not interfering with Bailey’s secretarial work...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bailey：</span><br>
Commander, listen up~ One of the key characteristics of the Rabbit Alien is——<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
Commander, a report for you—— Zzz... Bailey?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bailey：</span><br>
Ah, perfect timing Laffey~ Commander, one of the key characteristics of the Rabbit Alien is this!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
Laffey’s...ears?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bailey：</span><br>
Uh huh! A key feature of Rabbit Aliens are their—— “Rabbit ears”!<br>
<br>
Do you mean to say, they all look like rabbits...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
Hmm? Laffey’s ears, can actually be like this——<br>
<br>
Laffey took off her rabbit ears headband, emm…?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
……<br>
<br>
……<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bailey：</span><br>
Yes! Just like this! Say Commander, if you want to become a Rabbit Alien, then you must do this as well!<br>
<br>
The Commander was forced to wear Laffey’s headband...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
Oh...this is unexpected...is it working?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bailey：</span><br>
Hahaha! Now the Commander is a proud member of the Rabbit Alien!<br>
<br>
Huh…? The confusion seems to get deeper and deeper...<br>

III 「Rabbit Alien Characteristics—— “Effort”!」<br>
Port area, Academy<br>
Sigh, I was delayed with some of my routine tasks and now it’s already night time.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bailey：</span><br>
Hmm, let’s start today's training!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">???：</span><br>
Oh, it’s you again!<br>
<br>
This sounds like Bailey and…?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bailey：</span><br>
Ha, good evening Nachi-chan~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nachi：</span><br>
Don’t pretend that we’re close by calling me chan, I don’t plan on being your close friend...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bailey：</span><br>
But...but...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nachi：</span><br>
...forget it, since we’re teammates on the battlefield, then do what you must.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bailey：</span><br>
Yea~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nachi：</span><br>
I must say you really do put in the work, do you always practice after work?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bailey：</span><br>
Yep~ Sara-sensei told me, “Practice is essential!”<br>
Nachi-chan, don’t you always secretly come here as well to practice your dialogue and the likes?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nachi：</span><br>
I, I am merely reviewing, I am already familiar with those lines a long time ago.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bailey：</span><br>
Is that so, Nachi-chan you really are amazing.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nachi：</span><br>
...cough cough. Anyways, don’t tire yourself too much, don’t you have secretary duty during the day?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bailey：</span><br>
Yes~ Not to worry, though~ Helping the Commander is equally important to Bailey becoming an idol!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nachi：</span><br>
...you really are such a child.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bailey：</span><br>
Hehehe, am not~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nachi：</span><br>
Well, I won’t bother you, since you are practicing now.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bailey：</span><br>
Huh? I wanted Nachi-chan to see my progress though.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nachi：</span><br>
...Alright, I can do that.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bailey：</span><br>
Terrific!<br>
<br>
Looks like “Effort” is also a key trait of the Rabbit Alien characteristics.<br>

<br>
IV 「Rabbit Alien Characteristics—— “Idol”?」<br>
Port area, Command Center<br>
Bailey and Benson were found inside the Command Center.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Benson：</span><br>
Very nice~ You’re looking very cute today little Bailey~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bailey：</span><br>
Hehehe… you praised Bailey too much.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Benson：</span><br>
Heehee, you’re so cute. So that’s why you’re trying to become an idol~<br>
Once you’re finished with work today, you should come join me for idol training!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bailey：</span><br>
OK!<br>
Ah, the Commander has arrived~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Benson：</span><br>
Good morning, Commander~ So, the super cute Benson will take her leave, and will not bother you while you’re working then~<br>
<br>
Looks like Benson is going about her regular duties today.<br>
So as Hobby, although, how come Bailey wants to be an idol?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Ask Bailey.</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bailey：</span><br>
Right...at the very beginning, it was just all about having fun. I joined Benson and went singing and dancing. Slowly, the idea of becoming an idol really grew on me.<br>
<br>
...so you were influenced by Benson then.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bailey：</span><br>
Commander, let Bailey tell you something in secret, please don’t laugh ok...<br>
If one day, Bailey can become a famous idol, even Bailey’s fame will be known on other planets...<br>
Maybe one day, the Rabbit Aliens will invite Bailey to the Rabbit Planet to give a live performance!<br>
<br>
...that’s really typical of Bailey when it comes to crazy ideas.<br>
I feel like I’m getting a better understanding of the Rabbit Alien as the days go by.<br>

V 「Rabbit Alien Characteristics—— “Love”!」<br>
Port area, City Square<br>
We’re almost finished with today’s work, it’s time for us to go back and rest.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bailey：</span><br>
Yayyy, hehehe...<br>
<br>
Bailey is carrying a box of hay and rushing towards the dorm.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bailey：</span><br>
Ah, Commander, good evening~<br>
Oh, this? This is food for the rabbit~<br>
<br>
Is Bailey actually raising a rabbit...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bailey：</span><br>
Commander, would you like to come and see? The rabbit is super cute~<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Nods</span>'''''<br>
<br>
Port Area, Bailey’s Dorm<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bailey：</span><br>
This one is called Lucky, that one is called Pretty, they are both really adorable and nice~<br>
<br>
…No matter what you named them, they are indeed really cute.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bailey：</span><br>
Ok, it’s time for me to take them on a stroll.<br>
<br>
Look, when Bailey opened the cage, the two rabbits both leaped out immediately.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bailey：</span><br>
Don't hop around too far~ Here, Bailey is gonna give you more hay and water.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Help Bailey</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bailey：</span><br>
Ahhh, thank you Commander~<br>
Ack, you two made a mess of your cage again, you’re really a handful for Bailey...<br>
<br>
Seems like you’re used to cleaning up for after the two Rabbits, huh Bailey.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bailey：</span><br>
Actually Bailey never thought that raising rabbits would be such a handful...<br>
but just by looking at how cute they are, Bailey feels that all her hard work is all worth it~<br>
<br>
Look at Bailey, just talking about them puts a smile on her face.<br>
Looks like another characteristic of the Rabbit Alien was  just discovered.<br>

<br>
VI 「The Rabbit Alien Has Arrived?!」<br>
Port area, City Square<br>
According to reports, there will be a meteor shower tonight.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hobby：</span><br>
Yep, it must be the Creator who planned for tonight’s meteor shower~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kalk：</span><br>
You’re such a show off Hobby~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nachi：</span><br>
What will you wish for...<br>
<br>
….and so on and so forth, looks like the girls are very interested in meteor showers.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bailey：</span><br>
Sure am~<br>
<br>
It seems like Bailey is in a happier mood than her usual self.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bailey：</span><br>
Hmm? Good mood? Of course~ I am also eagerly waiting for tonight’s meteor shower.<br>
Bailey thinks that, perhaps the Rabbit planet has witnessed all of Bailey’s hard work and will send Bailey a spaceship to get her!<br>
<br>
...so that’s what she is actually thinking.<br>
Sadly, no matter how much Bailey hopes for it, I don’t think the Rabbit Planet will send a spaceship out for her…<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
Spaceship? Nope. Akashi saw from the telescope that it’s just an ordinary meteorite, nyaa!<br>
As for the Rabbit Planet, scientifically speaking, there’s no such planet at the very least in our galaxy, nyaa.<br>
Akashi gave her scientific opinion while passing by.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Remind Akashi</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
….ah, although, meow, Akashi did not see very clearly. Perhaps there was a spaceship mixed in all that meteor shower! Nyaa~<br>
Also, for the Rabbit Planet, perhaps it exists in another galaxy far away, nyaa!<br>
<br>
Although Akashi is remedying her words, but the atmosphere has become awkward.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bailey：</span><br>
Umm…? Isn’t the Rabbit planet something that Benson made up?<br>
<br>
...Huh?!<br>

Mysterious Rabbit Alien?!<br>
<br>
VII 「The Real Rabbit Alien」<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bailey：</span><br>
Hey...Commander, Bailey thinks that you misunderstood her.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Hesitate</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bailey：</span><br>
Bailey knew from the beginning that the Rabbit Planet was a lie told by Benson...<br>
More rather, given Benson’s personality, even if she wants to keep something a secret, she won’t be able to.<br>
<br>
…………？！<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bailey：</span><br>
But...does it really matter?<br>
Benson-chan told Bailey that the Rabbit Alien must be kind, the Rabbit Alien must be strong, and the Rabbit Alien are idols, after all.<br>
Bailey did it. So even if the Rabbit Aliens do not exist, then Bailey will be the first Rabbit Alien.<br>
<br>
…It seems that Bailey has become so mature from her words.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bailey：</span><br>
And and, just now Akashi said that perhaps they do exist in another g-galaxy? <br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
Indeed, nyaa~ Scientifically speaking, the universe is still vastly unexplored!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bailey：</span><br>
So, perhaps the Rabbit Alien Planet really does exist, only that we haven’t discovered it yet~<br>
If given the chance, Bailey wishes to go see them with Commander!<br>
<br>
Such an idealistic idea...<br>
Although, seeing the smile on Bailey’s face, almost makes people think that everything she’s said must be real.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hobby：</span><br>
Bailey, the meteor shower has begun!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bailey：</span><br>
Coming!~<br>
<br>
At the very least, even if the Rabbit Planet doesn’t exist, it will exist within the hearts and minds of this fleet.<br>
