<br>
The Dragon Palace – the legendary stronghold which the Sakura Empire laid hands on following a fierce battle.<br>
It now belonged to Musashi. Silently, it rested at the bottom of the sea.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Musashi：</span><br>
This place was always mine. Now, it is officially so.<br>
Jintsuu, how goes the mission?<br>
<span style="color:#c3abff;">Jintsuu META：</span><br>
Swimmingly thus far.<br>
We'll be ready to disembark by tomorrow noon and should reach the target according to schedule.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Musashi：</span><br>
You make me proud. We simply must aid Akagi with her plan.<br>
<span style="color:#c3abff;">Jintsuu META：</span><br>
Of course.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Musashi：</span><br>
Now, as for our own plan...<br>
<span style="color:#c3abff;">Jintsuu META：</span><br>
It is proceeding smoothly as well.<br>
I've already installed all the monitoring equipment and performed updates on the defense systems.<br>
...If need be, I can arrange guest seating as well.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Musashi：</span><br>
That won't be necessary. All that matters is that Akagi's plan is successful.<br>
Should the situation spiral out of control, however, we will be forced to take action. Surely you know this.<br>
<span style="color:#c3abff;">Jintsuu META：</span><br>
Of course. Apologies, I said too much.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Communicator：</span><br>
BEEP BEEP!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kii：</span><br>
Hey. I'm not interrupting you, am I?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Musashi：</span><br>
It's of no consequence. Has something happened?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kii：</span><br>
Zuikaku and Mikasa have shown up at your mansion. What should I do with them?<br>
<span style="color:#c3abff;">Jintsuu META：</span><br>
The plan has already entered its final stage. You could simply tell them that she is not at home.<br>
That is the truth, after all.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Musashi：</span><br>
Such an excuse would fool Zuikaku, yes.<br>
However, I will not stoop to telling half-truths to Mikasa.<br>
Here is my proposal – I shall go and meet Mikasa. In my absence, you are to hold the fort here.<br>
Proceed with the preparations as normal whilst I'm gone.<br>
Should I not return, or if I cannot be reached, depart with the Dragon Palace as planned.<br>
<span style="color:#c3abff;">Jintsuu META：</span><br>
As you say, Lady Musashi.<br>
Please watch yourself out there.<br>

Somewhere in the Northern Parliament...<br>
A fireplace crackled beneath gentle lighting inside a house. A bowl of steaming hot food rested on the countertop.<br>
Outside, a freezing blizzard rattled the windows. Despite its fury, its winds could not carry even a touch of cold through the four walls.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Grozny：</span><br>
Here – hot soup. It's really good.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Kirov META：</span><br>
(Ugh...)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Grozny：</span><br>
It's safe to eat. I'll have a bite first, if you're unsure.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Kirov META：</span><br>
(I was trying my damnedest to avoid this scenario...)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Grozny：</span><br>
*burp*... See? Now you eat.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Kirov META：</span><br>
(How did I end up in here?)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gangut：</span><br>
God. Your rigging is barely holding itself together.<br>
Comrade, give me the name of the bastard who did this! I'll make them pay!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kuybyshev：</span><br>
Settle down, Gangut. You can talk about that later.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Soobrazitelny：</span><br>
Yes, settle down! This lady fled from a hellish branch, so spare her the revenge talk for a minute!<br>
Don't you worry, Comrade Kirov META. This genius mechanic will make your rigging as good as new! You just rest and relax!<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Kirov META：</span><br>
("Fled from"? What is she talking about?)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Poltava：</span><br>
We're all surprised to see you. Your coming was foretold by Pamiat' Merkuria META.<br>
I can tell you've been through a lot by looking at you.<br>
But it's okay now. You're safe here, and our Northern Parliament welcomes you as one of our own.<br>
For the time being, focus on resting and recovering your strength. If anything happens, you can talk to us.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Kirov META：</span><br>
(Pamiat', you bastard... What lies have you told the people of this branch?)<br>
(Whatever you tried to do here, I can tell that you failed. They wouldn't have shown me this much kindness if you'd succeeded.)<br>
(And since you failed... that means I still have time.)<br>
(There's still something I can do.)<br>
(Comrades...)<br>
(I hope you won't mind me staying here a while.)<br>

{{折叠面板|标题=Royal Express|选项=3|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
Ventilation systems all green. Lights... working as normal.<br>
Then there's this carpet. Soft to perfection.<br>
<br>
A proud queen dressed in black stood inside a lavishly decorated train wagon, admiring every detail of her domain.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Yes, it is a nice wagon. Did you reference the Orient Express, by any chance?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
Only for its exterior and interior design. The nuts and bolts of the train are completely different.<br>
But that's all rather insignificant. Haven't you noticed how spacious it is?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Of course I have. It looks easily twice as big on the inside as the outside makes it seem.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
Yes, and we could make it even bigger if we so desired.<br>
To a degree, at least. It is still bound by the limitations inherent to the concept of a train.<br>
And besides, its defences are stronger the smaller it is, so we settled on this size.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Fascinating, isn't it? The things you can do with spatial distortions. Did you base this technology on that found in Mirror Seas?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
Hah! What a silly comparison. The Queen's Light is far more advanced than any Mirror Sea!<br>
Though, we can see why you'd think that way. More importantly, we haven't named the technology yet.<br>
How about... Yes, let's call them Mirror Rails!<br>
These Mirror Rails boast far superior electromagnetic shielding, defences, and plasticity over a Mirror Sea.<br>
But that's not their most impressive feature! You see, each wagon or engine can be affixed with its own concept.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Really? A different concept for each one?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
Indeed. The Queen's Light has much more than just one concept attached.<br>
It has not one, not two, but seven different and independent conceptual spaces!<br>
Which is to say, each section of the train exists independently of the others as its own Mirror Rail.<br>
What's more, they do not require a central control device somewhere within their space like a Mirror Sea does.<br>
That's what sets them apart from Siren technology more than anything else.<br>
Additionally, the concepts of each of these Rails are tied together by another concept – that of the Queen's Light.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Interesting. And since they're collectively perceived as a train, it strengthens their concepts as Rails.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
Indeed it does. Aren't we brilliant?<br>
As long as they form a collective, the defence of each Rail is also bolstered by the concept associated with it.<br>
If necessary, though, the Rails can be decoupled and operate independently of one another.<br>
That means, from an attacker's perspective, they must choose between three targets – the train as a collective, the individual Rails, and the third dimension.<br>
This makes the Rails particularly resistant to conceptual attacks.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Right. That sounds like a lot of sophistry to me.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
This is just how offence and defence work at the conceptual level.<br>
The theory of it isn't hard to grasp. Reinforcing a concept in practice, however, is a very costly endeavour.<br>
Supposing that a single Rail costs as much as your gate of Camelot, that cost doubles with each additional Rail you add.<br>
Theoretically, you can keep adding new Rails, but for now, 7 Rails is the limit.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
2 to the power of 6... That makes it 64 times the cost!<br>
That's utterly absurd. All that time, money, and resources for what? A mere train?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
It's not MERELY a train! And besides... Bah, forget it.<br>
Once you see what abominations there are out there, you'll understand.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Strange Device：</span><br>
BEEP BEEP!<br>
BEEP BEEP BEEP!<br>
BEEP BEEP BEEP BEEP BEEP!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Miss D：</span><br>
Elizabeth! Start the train already!<br>
Come on! I've waited for aaages!<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
Don't rush us! We're performing the final check!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Miss D：</span><br>
No! Hurry uuup! Come on already!<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
Telling us to hurry up won't do anything. Or what, will you reimburse us when something breaks if we depart unprepared?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Miss D：</span><br>
I can't afford that. Fiiine.<br>
Do your checks or whatever, but make it quick! I'm getting bored!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Strange Device：</span><br>
Your call has been terminated. BEEEEP...<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
She can be such a bloody nuisance. If we could choose, we wouldn't take her along.<br>
But, things are the way they are, so we just have to put up with her.<br>
Now, have you any last-minute luggage to stow before we set off?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
What? You mean we're departing now? Are we really going hunting with only the two of us?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
We never said we were going hunting. We're only moving to a new location to prepare.<br>
Say, why don't we travel to your branch? Your Camelot can surely accommodate one single train.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
What?!<br>
Hold on a minute! I've never said you're welcome to stay for who knows how long!<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Queen Elizabeth META：</span><br>
Lack of permission didn't stop YOU from crashing at OUR place and helping yourself to our tea and biscuits! What goes around comes around!<br>
Now shush! Onward, Queen's Light!<br>

<br>
It was a barren place, its endless vastness being its sole defining quality.<br>
There was no sky, no land, not even a sea. It was a blank space in every sense.<br>
For this was the border between truth and falsehood.<br>
<span style="color:#bdbdbd;">？？？：</span><br>
"I" sensed pain. "I" heard someone sobbing.<br>
It's so lonesome, so noisy in this place...<br>
Is this... "my" birthplace?<br>
Perhaps it is. Perhaps it isn't.<br>
No... At this moment, it certainly isn't.<br>
"I" was born from the void. The void "I" brought with me, and the void "I" shall return to.<br>
Travelers from afar, please give "me" your attention...<br>
And witness "my" demise.<br>
<br>
Somewhere, in an unknown location...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Arbiter: Strength VIII：</span><br>
Signal received from monitoring device. Adjusted for relative time, test site F-45733 disappeared at the physical level approximately 3 hours ago.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Arbiter: Temperance XIV：</span><br>
Searching for the coordinates of F-45733.<br>
Coordinates found. 2.9143, 99.9998, 19.9998, -2376029143.<br>
100 plus 20? It was an extreme environment experiment?<br>
Then we have a likely culprit behind the disappearance.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Arbiter: Strength VIII：</span><br>
Yeah. A spatial impact event caused by a category V threat was detected, too. Observed intensity: superlative. Threat level: max.<br>
This is no joke. We need to reorder our priority list and make this our number one issue.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Arbiter: The Hermit IX：</span><br>
The capacity of our local vessels isn't enough. The three of us will need to reroute at minimum 80% of our mainframes' resources.<br>
Contact the other Arbiters in the region and request assistance.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Arbiter: Temperance XIV：</span><br>
On it. I can't promise we'll get much help on such short notice, however.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Arbiter: The Hermit IX：</span><br>
...Pause your active tasks. We'll move in right now.<br>
<br>
??? - Ashes' Temporary Base<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Fusou META：</span><br>
Our "old friends" have put their protocol on halt! It looks like they're getting ready for a transfer.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Hiyou META：</span><br>
They are? Maybe their patience has finally run out.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Junyou META：</span><br>
The Hermit, Temperance, Strength... Those three have been a thorn in our side for an eternity.<br>
I thought we wouldn't get to strike back at them until Scharnhorst and that Friedrich der Große were done constructing our new base.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Enterprise META：</span><br>
...It's possible that that spatial impact caught their attention.<br>
Wichita and Kimberly are already en route. They won't let those bastards do as they please.<br>
Takao, the command baton is yours. We're gonna be a thorn in THEIR side this time.<br>
Then once our new base is finished, we'll continue with our original plan and deal with those Arbiters once and for all.<br>
One last thing – Wichita's unit will decide when we rendezvous according to the situation on the front.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Takao META：</span><br>
Roger. Recovering that which Essex found takes top priority. Go, and rest assured knowing that I shall hold the fort.<br>

A shipgirl sat by the windowsill of a steel building, gazing out at the vast white expanse as she downed her drink in one big gulp.<br>
<span style="color:#bdbdbd;">Hatakaze META：</span><br>
Ahh... Orange juice. That's a surprise. I didn't know you kept potable beverages around.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Arbiter: The Devil XV：</span><br>
Are you moved?<br>
<span style="color:#bdbdbd;">Hatakaze META：</span><br>
A little.<br>
I'm not as concerned with the drink as I am with this building. How in the world did you construct it?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Arbiter: The Devil XV：</span><br>
Sorry, that's a secret between Arbiters.<br>
You don't want to stay here for too long. The white void will drive you insane.<br>
<span style="color:#bdbdbd;">Hatakaze META：</span><br>
I know. That's why I hate going here.<br>
Enough beating around the bush. Why did you summon me?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Arbiter: The Devil XV：</span><br>
No particular reason. I was just doing someone a favor.<br>
<span style="color:#bdbdbd;">Hatakaze META：</span><br>
YOU do favors for people?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Arbiter: The Devil XV：</span><br>
Of course I do. The person in question was down on her luck.<br>
And I mean REALLY down on her luck! Ahahahaha!<br>
First her home was stolen from her, then her big plan failed spectacularly.<br>
I stumbled across her and thought it was so funny, I just had to give her a helping hand.<br>
<span style="color:#bdbdbd;">Hatakaze META：</span><br>
What are you talking about?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Arbiter: The Devil XV：</span><br>
It'll be quicker if you just ask her yourself.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Communicator：</span><br>
CLICK!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Arbiter: The Devil XV：</span><br>
Pamiat', I've done what you asked. Now talk to her yourself.<br>
<span style="color:#bdbdbd;">Hatakaze META：</span><br>
...Pamiat'?<br>
From what Devil told me, things aren't going so well for you.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Pamiat' Merkuria META：</span><br>
"Not going so well"? Yeah, that's putting it mildly!<br>
Do you have any idea how badly your intel screwed me? Things were COMPLETELY different from what you said!<br>
<span style="color:#bdbdbd;">Hatakaze META：</span><br>
Come again?<br>
My intel should've been accurate. I just gave you what my probe had learned.<br>
There may have been minor errors, but nothing that should've rendered the intel worthless.<br>
That is... unless the Sakura Empire of test site beta actually knows very little.<br>
Tell me, what exactly was wrong with the intel?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Pamiat' Merkuria META：</span><br>
Too many things to list! We'd be here all day if I told you each and every one! Come here and see for yourself!<br>
<span style="color:#bdbdbd;">Hatakaze META：</span><br>
Unfortunately, I have something important to deal with first. You-know-who has her eyes on it, so my hands are tied.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Arbiter: The Devil XV：</span><br>
You're talking about the spatial fluctuation, aren't you?<br>
<span style="color:#bdbdbd;">Hatakaze META：</span><br>
So you know about it, too.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Arbiter: The Devil XV：</span><br>
Mhm. They asked me to come help.<br>
<span style="color:#bdbdbd;">Hatakaze META：</span><br>
Well? Are you going to?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Arbiter: The Devil XV：</span><br>
I might. If YOU'RE leaving, do me a solid and take me with you.<br>
Jumping such a long distance all by myself takes a lot of effort.<br>
<span style="color:#bdbdbd;">Hatakaze META：</span><br>
Sounds like a plan.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Arbiter: The Devil XV：</span><br>
I love me a plan.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Pamiat' Merkuria META：</span><br>
......<br>
What do you MEAN "sounds like a plan"?!<br>
What about me?<br>
What am I supposed to do?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Arbiter: The Devil XV：</span><br>
Take it easy. Just hang tight and a solution will come your way.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Pamiat' Merkuria META：</span><br>
Yeah, right. Even you don't believe that.<br>
<span style="color:#bdbdbd;">Hatakaze META：</span><br>
Ahem. Pamiat', you're a legend. Whatever hardships you face, I know you will overcome them.<br>
I'll be right there after I wrap up my own business.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Pamiat' Merkuria META：</span><br>
Seriously? And how long is that gonna take?<br>
<span style="color:#bdbdbd;">Hatakaze META：</span><br>
Hmm... At this point, it's hard to say.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Arbiter: The Devil XV：</span><br>
Are you done talking yet? I'm closing the connection.<br>
<span style="color:#bdbdbd;">Hatakaze META：</span><br>
Yes, go ahead. Let's resume our own conversation.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Arbiter: The Devil XV：</span><br>
Alright. Buh-bye!<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Pamiat' Merkuria META：</span><br>
Hey! Wai–<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Communicator：</span><br>
CLICK!<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Pamiat' Merkuria META：</span><br>
Uggghhh...<br>
So I'm not getting any backup. Great. Just great.<br>
What was that about a "spatial fluctuation"? What's so important about that?<br>
Eh, forget it. None of my business.<br>
All I know is – she's not the least bit stressed, so I shouldn't be either.<br>
If she wants me to wait, then I'm gonna wait on my own terms!<br>
It just so happens there is a buttload of resorts nearby, so...<br>
I'm gonna help myself to a test site vacation!<br>

Iris Orthodoxy - Conference Room<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Whew... After all those detours, they're finally moving forward with your plan, Commander.<br>
You've fought hard for this. Relish this moment.<br>
Also, we should probably–<br>
...Oh, look at the time.<br>
I've got an urgent meeting I need to attend, so I sadly can't join you for dinner.<br>
But please, DO eat dinner. I don't want to hear excuses about how eating is a chore.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Will do.</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：Want me to save some for you?</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Good.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Thanks, but no need. I have a feeling it's going to be a long meeting.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''I'll just find something nice to eat after everything's done.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Crap! I've gotta run. Talk to you later, Commander!<br>
<br>
I see Memphis off, then I leave the conference room.<br>
I walk through the door and start taking my first step out into the evening sunlight... when all of sudden, it's all gone.<br>
It has been replaced by that view of space – the one that always appears when Helena META and I talk.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
Good evening, Commander.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I thought we agreed that you'd give a warning before you contacted me...<br>
Since you didn't, it must be urgent. Am I correct?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
Yes... BZZZT... Sorry about that. There was no time to give you a warning.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
What's the matter?<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
BZZZT... plan... BZZZT... went wrong... BZZZT...<br>
BZZZT... The situation is a lot... BZZZT... more complicated than anticipated... BZZZT...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Helena, you keep cutting out.<br>
The connection is barely holding up.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
Cutting out? BZZZT... Hang on... BZZZT... run a search... BZZZT...<br>
BZZZT... No... BZZZT... jamming source, it's... BZZZT...<br>
BZZZT... the guest room... BZZZT...<br>
BZZZZZZT...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Helena? Helena!<br>
<br>
As the noise intensifies, the projection of Helena becomes increasingly distorted, eventually collapsing altogether into a blue dot before disappearing.<br>
The distant stars, too, seem to flicker and twitch.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I remember Helena saying this space exists somewhere within an Arbiter – The Tower, I think it was.<br>
Therefore, it should be impossible for almost anyone to find this place, let alone jam it.<br>
Given that, it's likely that an enemy of hers is responsible for this.<br>
Before she cut out, she said something about a "jamming source" and that it was in "the guest room."<br>
The question is – what guest room? Where?<br>
Maybe she meant where I am. I should order a sweep of the whole building when I get back.<br>
I have a bad feeling about this. The same group behind the near-superimposition event in Antarctica might be trying to catch us off-guard again...<br>
If so, disaster is on the horizon.<br>
<span style="color:#ffc960;">Helena META：</span><br>
I sure hope so. Your branch is currently under constant threat.<br>
You stopped her from accomplishing her first objective. She still has two more.<br>
Be on your guard, Commander.<br>
The battle isn't over yet.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
What happened in Antarctica was just a drill. Their real target is the Orthodoxy.<br>
If the group behind Antarctica was responsible for jamming the line Helena set up for me back then, it stands to reason that they could also hack this virtual space.<br>
I need to tell the girls about this ASAP.<br>
<br>
I look around, waiting for the view of the stars to change, but it doesn't.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Dammit. I never did ask Helena what you do to "hang up" in here...<br>
What do I do now?<br>
<br>
......<br>

'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项3）</span>'''''It has something to do with the lack of pain and realizing you're dreaming. Maybe if I fall from a height, the impact will send me back to reality?<br>

<br>
That's when, all of a sudden, I hear the ring of a wind chime close by.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Ah... There's that wind chime again.)<br>
<br>
The next thing I know, a door has appeared in front of me.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
And there's that door again. The same one I saw when I delved into Anchorage's data and when I spoke to Soyuz.<br>
Seems it can reach me anywhere – even in this virtual space you created, Helena.<br>
Unless... it's an emergency exit, and you created this, too?<br>
<br>
There is no answer. The door just stands there, silently.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
It doesn't look like there's any other way out...<br>
I'm opening it.<br>
