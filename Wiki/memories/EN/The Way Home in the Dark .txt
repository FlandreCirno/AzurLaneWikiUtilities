<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vauquelin：</span><br>
Dunkerque, it's time to go.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dunkerque：</span><br>
Mm, I'm ready.<br>
Sorry for making you take time out of your schedule for me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vauquelin：</span><br>
Say nothing of it! Safely evacuating you is part of our duty, Dunkerque!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dunkerque：</span><br>
There should be nothing to worry about. Since the repairs are about done, I alone should be able to...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vauquelin：</span><br>
Non, non. Those were just emergency repairs. You'll have to rest up properly once we get you back home.<br>
Look, with what's been going on between Vichiya, Iron Blood, and the Royal Navy, we've had to wait months for the chance to make this journey.<br>
After making them wait this long as well, our enemies are probably pretty checked out as well~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dunkerque：</span><br>
......<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vauquelin：</span><br>
Sorry, that was just a joke! Don't take it too seriously!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dunkerque：</span><br>
No, perhaps it is I who was not giving adequate consideration to everyone else's feelings.<br>
Once again, thank you for escorting me, Vauquelin.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vauquelin：</span><br>
No worries! If anything, sorry for making you put up with me since I tend to blurt things out without thinking!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tartu：</span><br>
(Vauquelin, we've all been waiting, but Dunkerque herself has been waiting even longer... so...)<br>
(Mm... You're going to convince her? Hmm...)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vauquelin：</span><br>
...tu<br>
Tartu!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tartu：</span><br>
Huh?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vauquelin：</span><br>
Jeez... what are you spacing out again for...<br>
Kersaint, Fougueux, and the others are all ready, so we're just waiting for Tartu now...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tartu：</span><br>
I've been ready though?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vauquelin：</span><br>
Just tell us then if that's the case... All right, before we go, let's go over the mission one more time!<br>
It'll be dangerous, but let's try to take a straight line to Toulon.<br>
The only place to hide along the way are the Balearic Islands, and we can expect Royal Navy patrols.<br>
I don't want to end up fighting Iris Libre... but if it comes down to it...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tartu：</span><br>
Mm...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vauquelin：</span><br>
What's our plan for if that situation arises, Tartu?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tartu：</span><br>
...Huh?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vauquelin：</span><br>
Tartu... you're in your little world again!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tartu：</span><br>
Umm... I was thinking about what the best route to Toulon would be...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vauquelin：</span><br>
Come on, we're way past that already!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tartu：</span><br>
Is that so...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vauquelin：</span><br>
YES... IT... IS... SO!<br>
Whatever, it's my fault for getting caught up in your pace.<br>
Anyway, time is of the essence, so let's keep our wits about us and break through this area as quickly as possible! Got it?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tartu：</span><br>
Got it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vauquelin：</span><br>
Everyone's here and we have our game plan... so let's set out!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dunkerque：</span><br>
Very well. If we must fight, then I shall do my part.<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vauquelin：</span><br>
Mmhmm, according to Fougueux's information, we'll have some breathing room once we beat back the enemies ahead of us!<br>
Tartu, you'd better not start daydreaming in the middle of battle!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tartu：</span><br>
I wouldn't do that.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vauquelin：</span><br>
I sure hope so...<br>
*sigh* I'm supposed to be escorting Dunkerque, but here I am also babysitting Tartu...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dunkerque：</span><br>
Haha... I think she's doing just fine. You should try to have a bit more faith in her...<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dunkerque：</span><br>
We managed to push them back for now.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vauquelin：</span><br>
I hope we don't run into any more trouble on the way to Toulon...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dunkerque：</span><br>
……<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vauquelin：</span><br>
What's wrong, Dunkerque?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dunkerque：</span><br>
I was just thinking about the Royal Navy. We ended up waging an all-out war against them after all...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vauquelin：</span><br>
I wonder indeed... The Vichya Dominion and Iris Libre used to be on the same side... and the Royal Navy as well, but I guess a lot happened...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tartu：</span><br>
There's no point thinking about all that now...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dunkerque：</span><br>
.........Mm, you're right.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vauquelin：</span><br>
(What a depressing mood...) Dunkerque, now's probably not the best time to think about this.<br>
Let's focus on getting back to Toulon so you can rest up and recover!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dunkerque：</span><br>
Hehe. I've had plenty of time to rest up in the docks... But, I also haven't been able to contribute to the Vichya's war efforts as a result...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vauquelin：</span><br>
That's not true at all!<br>
The only reason you've been out of commission is because of the treachery of that Perfidious Albion...<br>
So basically, umm, what I'm trying to say is...<br>
(Hey, Tartu! Help me find something I can say to reassure Dunkerque!)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tartu：</span><br>
Hmm...? Sorry, I only heard about half of it... But, in any case, I don't think you need to blame yourself, Dunkerque.<br>
Regardless of the camp - Royal Navy, Iron Blood, or Iris... I don't think there's anything we can do about the fact that their leaders think of us as weapons of war.<br>
What's more important is that there are comrades who are worried about you and eagerly awaiting your return, right...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vauquelin：</span><br>
That's right! Without your sweets, our morale is about to fall through the floor!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dunkerque：</span><br>
Hehe. I guess I'll be busy cooking after I get back.<br>
I can't afford to let Strasbourg see me in such a sorry state after all.<br>
Vauquelin, Tartu, let's continue to push forward.<br>

{{折叠面板|标题=Winter on the Méditerranée|选项=4|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=否}}
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vauquelin：</span><br>
Nothing's happening...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tartu：</span><br>
We're on an escort mission, so isn't it better if nothing is happening...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vauquelin：</span><br>
Touché... Wait, since when did you learn how to make retorts?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tartu：</span><br>
Hm...? Am I not allowed to...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vauquelin：</span><br>
No, I just assumed you would always be off thinking about other things by yourself until someone else grabbed your attention...<br>
By the way, is it just me, or was the Mediterranean always this chilly?<br>
Once we get back, if there are no other missions waiting for me, maybe I'll take a trip somewhere~<br>
It'd be nice to head up north to see the snow, or even an aurora... What do you think, Tartu?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tartu：</span><br>
I bet you'd want to go with one of your Iris girls.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vauquelin：</span><br>
Ehehe~<br>

{{折叠面板|标题=Arethusa|选项=5|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=否}}
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dunkerque：</span><br>
There's a fleet we haven't seen before ahead of us... I wonder if it's another Royal patrol fleet?<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Arethusa：</span><br>
A Vichya fleet?! Why would they be here...?!<br>
And if I'm not mistaken, you're that battlecruiser, Dunkerque?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vauquelin：</span><br>
I knew it, a blasted Royal fleet! Dunkerque, don't push yourself too hard!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tartu：</span><br>
If we let them get away, they're going to report our position... Vauquelin, we have to fight!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dunkerque：</span><br>
No hard feelings... but you will be letting us through!<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=Opposition|选项=6|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=否}}
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dunkerque：</span><br>
Sorry, but we'll need you to stay quiet.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Arethusa：</span><br>
Guh...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vauquelin：</span><br>
I've confirmed that Arethusa has been incapacitated!<br>
Wasn't that amazing...? Tartu, were you watching Dunkerque just now?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tartu：</span><br>
I saw... so stop shaking me around already...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dunkerque：</span><br>
We had a numbers advantage, so this did feel a bit unfair...<br>
But as Tartu said, our priority right now is to safely make it home to our friends.<br>
Now's not the time to think about negotiating with the Royal Navy or taking revenge against them.<br>
No matter when or where, my duty is to protect our friends of the Vichya Dominion and uphold the Iris Orthodoxy.<br>
My purpose as a ship is to be a guardian knight - that is the meaning of my existence.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vauquelin：</span><br>
Mmhmm! The same's true for us, although we still have a ways to go! Right, Tartu?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tartu：</span><br>
(She's kindhearted, strong, and dependable...)<br>
(I hope I can mature into someone as cool as Dunkerque when I'm older...)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vauquelin：</span><br>
Tartu...!!<br>

{{折叠面板|标题=Snack Time|选项=7|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=否}}
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vauquelin：</span><br>
I'm feeling a bit hungry...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tartu：</span><br>
We're almost there. Just hold on a bit longer.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vauquelin：</span><br>
But I'm hungryyyyy... Ah! I'm sure I saw some snacks among the stuff you brought...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dunkerque：</span><br>
My handmade sweets? I planned to give them to everyone after we got back to Toulon...<br>
I know how hard it is to fight on an empty stomach... You can have some, but try not to go overboard.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vauquelin：</span><br>
R-really? You're the best, Dunkerque!<br>
Macarons, Montblancs, profiteroles, mille-feuille... there's so much stuff here I don't know where to start...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tartu：</span><br>
That's because I made enough for everyone. Vauquelin, try not to eat too much, all right?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vauquelin：</span><br>
I know! Now, where to start... Mmmmm! So good! Tartu, do you want some as well? Dunkerque, can Tartu also have some?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dunkerque：</span><br>
Hehe, sure. I can always make more later. Tartu, did you also want to take a break?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tartu：</span><br>
...Um, thank you. In that case, I'll also help myself.<br>
This nostalgic aroma... Delicious!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dunkerque：</span><br>
(It'd be nice to be able to enjoy sweets with everyone again...)<br>
(I wonder if there will ever come a day...)<br>
(...when Jean Bart and Richelieu can enjoy these sweets together again...)<br>

{{折叠面板|标题=Nelson|选项=8|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=否}}
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vauquelin：</span><br>
Dunkerque, sorry I took so long eating...<br>
Fougueux reported that they've spotted the Royal battleship, Nelson.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dunkerque：</span><br>
Nelson, one of the Big Seven... It wouldn't be a good idea to engage her. Try to avoid her if possible.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vauquelin & Tartu：</span><br>
Got it!<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Nelson：</span><br>
Stop right there, whoever you are!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vauquelin：</span><br>
Shoot, she discovered us...<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Nelson：</span><br>
You guys are... the Vichya Dominion's...!<br>
Trying to flee to Toulon for repairs, huh? ...I won't let you get away!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dunkerque：</span><br>
If it's just her...<br>
Tartu, Vauquelin, we're going to make a break for it before she can call reinforcements!<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=The Darkened Path Home|选项=9|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=否}}
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Nelson：</span><br>
Her speed... I really can't deal with these tight turns in night battles...!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vauquelin：</span><br>
Ahaha! A direct hit! That's the power of a Vichya knight's torpedoes!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dunkerque：</span><br>
Don't overextend. It's our victory as long as we make it back to Toulon.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Nelson：</span><br>
Wait, Dunkerque! What do you possibly hope to achieve returning to the Vichya Dominion in its current state?!<br>
Upon the honor of Her Majesty, we will guarantee your safety if you surrender yourself to the Royal Navy!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dunkerque：</span><br>
...You're right...<br>
...I might not be able to make a difference after I return...<br>
But I am one of Vichya's Templar Knights. If the Vichya is ever in danger...<br>
As long as I still have friends who place their trust within me, I will return to their sides.<br>
My purpose is to fight for my friends and the Vichya Dominion.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Nelson：</span><br>
Dunkerque...<br>
I see... May Iris watch over you, Dunkerque.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vauquelin：</span><br>
F-Finally, I can see the light of Toulon... I'm exhausted...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tartu：</span><br>
We're almost there, but let's stay alert until we've arrived in port.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vauquelin：</span><br>
I know, I know! Tartu, why does it feel like you're hyper focused today~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tartu：</span><br>
Huh? I was just thinking about the best way to dock...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vauquelin：</span><br>
Oh, I guess you're not that focused after all...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tartu：</span><br>
Hm? Vauquelin? What's the matter?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dunkerque：</span><br>
Hehe~ Now that we've arrived, it feels like we can finally take a deep breath~<br>
<br>
.......................................<br>
After crossing the perilous sea in the darkness, battlecruiser Dunkerque and the ships escorting her safely arrive at Toulon in the Vichya Dominion. But at the same time...<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">?????：</span><br>
In this "Simulation," the Royal Navy will be dismantled after dozens of their ships sink to the hands of battleship Jean Bart...<br>
But of course, I would not allow such an outcome to take place. After all, my "Experiment" must continue...<br>
After all... What kind of future can these ships, who have been saved by humanity, find at the intersection of light and shadow?<br>
Ahaha... I shall continue my observation...<br>
