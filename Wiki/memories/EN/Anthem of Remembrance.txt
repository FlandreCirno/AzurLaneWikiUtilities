Two weeks before the World Expo's closing<br>
Sardegna Empire - Cathedral<br>
In the solemn stillness of the cathedral chamber, only a few faint, forlorn specks of candlelight parted the darkness.<br>
The flickering shadows cast across the floor's tiles were as branches shivering in anticipation of a coming storm.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Trento META：</span><br>
...The sign has been made manifest.<br>
The clouds part...<br>
...and a holy light spreads across this land.<br>
I see... a symbol of the Divine's descent.<br>
...A radiant embodiment of glory.<br>
Then, I see...<br>
<span style="color:#92fc63;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
Stop right there! You totally lost me, so let's back it up a bit.<br>
You mentioned something about the "Divine's descent." In other words, the incarnation has finally appeared?<br>
Magnificent! This confirms that my information is correct.<br>
Ahahahaha!<br>
Oh, how long I've waited for this day!<br>
Finally, the last piece of the puzzle needed for my feat of strength has arrived–<br>
Now... Come to me, "God"!<br>
The day when all wishes shall be granted is coming.<br>
Ahahaha! Ohohohoho!<br>
<br>
Marco Polo's discordant laughter echoed through the halls as she turned to leave the cathedral.<br>
The gust of wind that blew through the doors she threw open snuffed out the last candle.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Trento META：</span><br>
...Then the clouds cover the skies once more.<br>
...The world is enveloped in a false light.<br>
...And so, it is born. "God's" eternal, hollow paradise on earth.<br>
<br>
Audio Recording: Conversation with the Tribunal / Before the Crimson Axis' Founding<br>
>>"You're being naive, Richelieu. Now that they smell blood in the water, the higher-ups won't be satisfied with just that."<br>
>>"The Iron Blood invasion will come sooner or later."<br>
>>"I've already planned accordingly."<br>
>>"The question is when, where, and how will they do it?"<br>
>>"It's anyone's guess. All I can do for now is continue strengthening our intel network."<br>
Audio Recording: Conversation with the Tribunal / Before the Crimson Axis' Founding<br>
>>"And what of the Royal Navy? Any news from their higher-ups?"<br>
>>"...Are you referring to the 'Peace for our time' speech?"<br>
>>"The possibility that the Royal Navy has secretly been allied with Iron Blood since the beginning..."<br>
>>"...is not one that I want to entertain."<br>
>>"So far, we have no intel confirming that to be true."<br>
>>"Perhaps, the Royal Navy is taking a wait-and-see approach for now."<br>
>>"If that is the case, we must get them to act."<br>
>>"We will be welcoming a Royal Navy delegation soon, so that will be a good place to start–"<br>
Present Day - Richelieu's Fleet<br>
A black sun, quietly burning in the dusky sky.<br>
<span style="color:#92fc63;">Richelieu：</span><br>

<span style="color:#92fc63;">???：</span><br>
Cardinal?<br>
Oh, Cardinaaal?<br>
<span style="color:#92fc63;">Le Terrible：</span><br>
Cardinal Richelieu, are you alright?<br>
<span style="color:#92fc63;">Richelieu：</span><br>
Mm... My head still feels a bit heavy...<br>
Forgive me. I must've dozed off.<br>
But, I'll be fine. More importantly, did you have something to tell me?<br>
<span style="color:#92fc63;">Le Terrible：</span><br>
Yes. Something very important, in fact.<br>
Lady Clemenceau has sent you a message. I shall read it to you.<br>
"The time has come for you to reclaim the Iris' Crown."<br>
<span style="color:#92fc63;">Richelieu：</span><br>
...I see.<br>
<span style="color:#92fc63;">Le Terrible：</span><br>
You don't seem particularly excited.<br>
<span style="color:#92fc63;">Richelieu：</span><br>
The Crown of the Holy See is the Orthodoxy's symbol, yes, but that is all it is – a symbol.<br>
The Orthodoxy's true legitimacy comes from those who have faith in it.<br>
Having said that, this message isn't at all meaningless.<br>
The very fact that the Tribunal is willing to tell me about the Crown is proof that the winds of change are blowing.<br>
And the key to the Crown lies in Malta.<br>
If we want to seize this opportunity, that's where we should go.<br>
<span style="color:#92fc63;">Le Terrible：</span><br>
That will not be necessary.<br>
The situation has changed after your splendid retaking of the Basilica Isles. We are now able to sail directly to the Crown.<br>
<span style="color:#92fc63;">Richelieu：</span><br>
Really?<br>
<span style="color:#92fc63;">Le Terrible：</span><br>
Yes. Our target is Saint Helena. The Tribunal established a secret stronghold on the island some time ago, with the Royal Navy's permission.<br>
That is where we'll find the Crown, guarded by Marseillaise.<br>
<span style="color:#92fc63;">Richelieu：</span><br>
Wait... Marseillaise?<br>
<span style="color:#92fc63;">Le Terrible：</span><br>
Indeed. Many assume she was stricken from the record, but she has actually been hiding on that island, protecting the Crown.<br>
<span style="color:#92fc63;">Richelieu：</span><br>
Le Terrible, I need to tell you something that you might not believe. I've been having recurring dreams...<br>
And in the last one, I saw Marseillaise beneath a black sun, begging for help.<br>
<span style="color:#92fc63;">Le Terrible：</span><br>
A black sun, you say?<br>
That does seem like quite the ill omen, but I fear for what it means if it isn't.<br>
<span style="color:#92fc63;">Richelieu：</span><br>
At any rate, I'm concerned about Marseillaise's well-being. Can we get in touch with her?<br>
<span style="color:#92fc63;">Le Terrible：</span><br>
I'm afraid not. The stronghold cannot send nor receive messages to maintain the illusion that it is uninhabited.<br>
Perhaps Lady Clemenceau wants us to go there because she has sensed something is wrong...<br>
<span style="color:#92fc63;">Richelieu：</span><br>
Then let us set sail at once. To Saint Helena!<br>

<br>
Years ago...<br>
Vichya Dominion - Command Center<br>
Marseillaise's recollection<br>
The command center, normally bustling with noise and activity at all times, had fallen silent.<br>
That is, except for the voice of Jean Bart, shouting a report through her communicator.<br>
<span style="color:#92fc63;">Communicator：</span><br>
"Remember what happened at Kébir! The Azur Lane already made their intentions clear to us..."<br>
"The Vichya Dominion is surrounded by vultures ready to devour us. But what of it?"<br>
"While I draw breath, I will never allow us to bow before such hypocrites!"<br>
"The proud Templar Knights shall never bow their heads! So that we may never become puppets..."<br>
"I hereby order all of you to sink!"<br>
<br>
The girl sitting at the table listened to the speech absent-mindedly until the command center grew noisy once more.<br>
It was a noise she had not heard in a very long time. What a terrible, cacophonous noise.<br>
<span style="color:#92fc63;">Marseillaise：</span><br>
(The esteemed Templar Knights have fallen...)<br>
(The Naval HQ has sent Iron Blood's forces into our territory once again...)<br>
(The Reenactment has been carried out. What options do we have...?)<br>
(What am I to do to protect the Orthodoxy?)<br>
<br>
The girl was pulled out of her brooding by a voice calling out to her.<br>
<span style="color:#92fc63;">Joffre：</span><br>
There you are, Marseillaise.<br>
This facility is no longer safe. Please come with me.<br>
<span style="color:#92fc63;">Marseillaise：</span><br>
Joffre? But, I...<br>
I'm not going anywhere.<br>
The Reenactment is complete. The Holy See will soon be occupied by someone else.<br>
In this regard, I see little difference between the Azur Lane and the Crimson Axis.<br>
Surely, the Tribunal won't sit around and watch this affair unfold from the sidelines...<br>
(If the capital were to be left undefended, what would we do if the Sirens attacked?)<br>
...By the way, Joffre, why are you here?<br>
<span style="color:#92fc63;">Joffre：</span><br>
The Tribunal has decided to relocate the Crown.<br>
We would like you to evacuate, and preserve your combat strength–<br>
<span style="color:#92fc63;">Marseillaise：</span><br>
Evacuate...? The Tribunal, protectors of the Iris' sanctity, would have me flee without even putting up a fight?<br>
I will not run, Joffre. I must see this Reenactment through to its conclusion.<br>
I will not go back. Not now, not in the future. The Fighting Angel belongs only on the battlefield.<br>
Go ahead and leave, Joffre. Don't worry about me.<br>
<span style="color:#92fc63;">Joffre：</span><br>
Who said anything about "running away"?<br>
The Crown of the Holy See is a symbol of the Orthodoxy. Its true legitimacy will be preserved as long as there are people who have faith in it.<br>
And only you, Marseillaise, can carry out the sacred duty of protecting it.<br>
<span style="color:#92fc63;">Marseillaise：</span><br>
This Crown... is it really that valuable?<br>
Certainly, it's true that as long as people recognize the legitimacy of the Crown, there will be those who seek to claim it. But...<br>
That being the case, why am I hearing this from the Tribunal?<br>
<span style="color:#92fc63;">Joffre：</span><br>
...If the Templar Knights represent the Orthodoxy's light, then the Tribunal represents its darkness.<br>
As you said, it is a self-evident truth that there will be those who seek to claim the Crown.<br>
Therefore, as the Fighting Angel, it is your sacred duty to keep it from the hands of evildoers.<br>
<span style="color:#92fc63;">Marseillaise：</span><br>
That's right... It is my duty to protect the Crown, even if it costs me my life.<br>
But, the Tribunal has no right to order me around. I heed only the will of the Holy Iris–<br>
<span style="color:#92fc63;">Joffre：</span><br>
What you heed is not the will of the Holy Iris, but rather the people who worship it.<br>
Iron Blood's forces are fast approaching. Given the situation at hand, the Naval HQ can have only one objective in mind:<br>
–The dissolution of the Iris Orthodoxy.<br>
That is why the Tribunal has prioritized securing the Crown over fighting against the Reenactment.<br>
There's no time to waste, Marseillaise. Take the Crown, and get as far away from Europa as you can.<br>
<span style="color:#92fc63;">Marseillaise：</span><br>
...To be honest, I still don't trust Clemenceau one bit.<br>
But, I'm willing to place my trust in you, Joffre.<br>
From now on, I, the Fighting Angel, shall carry out this sacred duty.<br>
May our paths cross again one day.<br>
<span style="color:#92fc63;">Joffre：</span><br>
Yes, I'm sure they will. May the Iris bless you on your long journey.<br>
<br>
Present Day<br>
Somewhere in the Atlantic<br>
Iris Libre Main Fleet<br>
<span style="color:#92fc63;">Béarn：</span><br>
Cardinal Richelieu, our recon planes will be approaching Saint Helena Island soon.<br>
<span style="color:#92fc63;">Richelieu：</span><br>
Good. Have the fleet keep its course and continue maintaining top speed.<br>
<span style="color:#92fc63;">Béarn：</span><br>
Understood.<br>
<span style="color:#92fc63;">Richelieu：</span><br>
Le Terrible, give me a rundown of Saint Helena's defensive capabilities should it come under attack.<br>
<span style="color:#92fc63;">Le Terrible：</span><br>
Let's see here... The Tribunal's secret fortress isn't located along the coast, but rather hidden inland within the mountains.<br>
Unless it is attacked by a high-level Siren such as Purifier, it is unlikely to fall to conventional forces.<br>
Your ability to launch a counteroffensive might be limited, but the stronghold itself can withstand a siege for quite some time.<br>
Furthermore, even if a high-level enemy were to show up, it would be difficult for them to determine exactly where to attack.<br>
Having all that said...<br>
The primary purpose of this stronghold is to stay hidden. Even locating it in the first place is not meant to be easy.<br>
<span style="color:#92fc63;">Richelieu：</span><br>
(If the island's defenses really are that strong, there's a chance we can still make it in time...)<br>
<span style="color:#92fc63;">Béarn：</span><br>
Cardinal Richelieu, we've located a Siren fleet in a fog bank up ahead.<br>
It appears to be moving in the same direction as us. There's a possibility it's headed towards the same destination.<br>
<span style="color:#92fc63;">Le Téméraire：</span><br>
That must be it! The Sirens must be trying to attack Saint Helena!<br>
<span style="color:#92fc63;">L'Opiniâtre：</span><br>
They're probably bringing in reinforcements after realizing that the island's defenses are tougher than they bargained for...<br>
<span style="color:#92fc63;">Le Téméraire：</span><br>
But, the fact that they're sending reinforcements at all means that the island hasn't fallen yet!<br>
<span style="color:#92fc63;">Béarn：</span><br>
Visual confirmation of humanoid Enforcer-type Sirens.<br>
Let me check their models... I'm seeing two different types.<br>
The two Enforcer XV models – Temptation and Restriction – as well as a mixed fleet of mass-produced ships.<br>
<span style="color:#92fc63;">Richelieu：</span><br>
Based on the information provided to us by the Eagle Union, those are the Enforcer models corresponding to Arbiter: The Devil XV.<br>
(That's not good news. If Enforcers are already showing up, that means...)<br>
<span style="color:#92fc63;">Béarn：</span><br>
Cardinal Richelieu, the Siren fleet has begun changing formations. They seem to have noticed us.<br>
<span style="color:#92fc63;">Richelieu：</span><br>
That leaves us with no choice, then.<br>
Forward, Iris Fleet! Annihilate the Sirens!<br>

KABOOM––!!<br>
<span style="color:#92fc63;">Le Téméraire：</span><br>
*pant*... *pant*...!<br>
Lady Richelieu, the enemy Siren forces have been completely wiped out!<br>
<span style="color:#92fc63;">L'Opiniâtre：</span><br>
Those Enforcers sure packed a punch though...<br>
<span style="color:#92fc63;">Béarn：</span><br>
My recon planes have reached the Saint Helena airspace. I'll start scouting now.<br>
<span style="color:#92fc63;">Richelieu：</span><br>
I can only pray we're not too late...<br>
Le Terrible, do you think the stronghold would be able to defend against those Enforcers we fought against earlier?<br>
<span style="color:#92fc63;">Le Terrible：</span><br>
Under normal circumstances, yes.<br>
As long as the Sirens don't completely flatten the mountains on the island...<br>
<span style="color:#92fc63;">Richelieu：</span><br>
What if an Arbiter mainframe were to show up?<br>
<span style="color:#92fc63;">Le Terrible：</span><br>
Unfortunately, it'd fall in a heartbeat if that were the case.<br>
The Arbiters wield a completely different magnitude of power. They could vaporize the entire island at once.<br>
Why would you think that an Arbiter could be here though?<br>
We understand the Crown of the Holy See to be the symbol of the Iris Orthodoxy, but the Sirens would see it as they would any other object.<br>
<span style="color:#92fc63;">Richelieu：</span><br>
...You say that, but the reality is that an Arbiter's Enforcers have arrived.<br>
We must make haste and rescue Marseillaise.<br>
If we can get there first, we can minimize the perils that our colleague faces.<br>

<br>
Years ago...<br>
Somewhere in the Atlantic<br>
Marseillaise's recollection<br>
Breaking away from the Reenactment warzone, Marseillaise glided across the ocean's surface.<br>
As she continued onwards, she soon saw a mass of twisted, burning steel appear on the horizon.<br>
<span style="color:#92fc63;">Marseillaise：</span><br>
I can't believe the Siren fleet made it this far...<br>
Even this place isn't safe anymore...<br>
If the Sirens have already pushed forward this much, we have no choice but to go westward.<br>
There might be a suitable location on the African mainland...<br>
<br>
The girl changed directions, and slowed down her speed into a cautious advance.<br>
A signal had suddenly appeared on her radar, and was moving towards her.<br>
<span style="color:#92fc63;">Marseillaise：</span><br>
What's the meaning of this...?<br>
<span style="color:#92fc63;">Le Terrible：</span><br>
I'm glad to see that you're doing well still, Marseillaise.<br>
<span style="color:#92fc63;">Marseillaise：</span><br>
You're... Le Terrible?<br>
Is that really you? You're not a Pawn, are you?<br>
I haven't heard from you since the Kébir Reenactment... I thought you had...<br>
<span style="color:#92fc63;">Le Terrible：</span><br>
Sank on the battlefield, or scuttled myself?<br>
<span style="color:#92fc63;">Marseillaise：</span><br>
Ugh... Sorry, it's been one tragedy after another these days...<br>
In any case, I'm glad to see you alive and well. I certainly was not expecting that.<br>
<span style="color:#92fc63;">Le Terrible：</span><br>
Indeed, the same goes for me. You could even say I was so happy I forgot to be surprised.<br>
To tell you the truth, there's been a ton going on behind the scenes with the Tribunal.<br>
<span style="color:#92fc63;">Marseillaise：</span><br>
Ever since Kébir?<br>
<span style="color:#92fc63;">Le Terrible：</span><br>
Yep, the whoooole time.<br>
I needed to remain undercover, so I wasn't able to reach out to you.<br>
But, this isn't about me–<br>
You're searching for a place to bunker down in, right?<br>
<span style="color:#92fc63;">Marseillaise：</span><br>
Correct. This place isn't safe anymore, and I need to go further west.<br>
<span style="color:#92fc63;">Le Terrible：</span><br>
Actually, I know just the place for you.<br>
<span style="color:#92fc63;">Marseillaise：</span><br>
Are you going to take me to Cardinal Richelieu?<br>
If that was your intention, then I can't–<br>
<span style="color:#92fc63;">Le Terrible：</span><br>
Not quite.<br>
I'd like to take you to Saint Helena, a secret Tribunal stronghold.<br>
I assure you, it's the safest place you'll find.<br>
<br>
Present day<br>
Near Saint Helena Island<br>
Iris Libre Main Fleet<br>
The peal of large-caliber cannons rang out in the waters surrounding Saint Helena.<br>
Burning Siren wreckages littered the area, dyeing the otherwise placid scenery a smoldering red.<br>
<span style="color:#92fc63;">Le Téméraire：</span><br>
How awful...<br>
<span style="color:#92fc63;">L'Opiniâtre：</span><br>
The Sirens really are trying to flatten these mountains...<br>
<span style="color:#92fc63;">Richelieu：</span><br>
Béarn, how's the scouting going?<br>
<span style="color:#92fc63;">Béarn：</span><br>
The Siren fleet has already captured most of the surrounding waters. Enforcers are also active in this area.<br>
However, a small fraction of the island's autonomous defense systems are still online, which means that the interior facility likely hasn't been destroyed yet.<br>
<span style="color:#92fc63;">Richelieu：</span><br>
They weren't able to capture the entire area?<br>
<span style="color:#92fc63;">Béarn：</span><br>
Correct. Their forces are not deployed in certain areas of the island, though I'm not sure why.<br>
<span style="color:#92fc63;">L'Opiniâtre：</span><br>
Are they trying to focus their attacks due to the sheer firepower of the defenses?<br>
<span style="color:#92fc63;">Le Téméraire：</span><br>
Nah, they're probably still reeling because we destroyed their reinforcements!<br>
In any case, Lady Richelieu, let's get ready to land!<br>
<span style="color:#92fc63;">Richelieu：</span><br>
Wait, don't be in such a rush.<br>
There's something not quite right about this island. You see it too, Le Terrible– I mean, Béarn?<br>
This place... reeks of Infection.<br>
<span style="color:#92fc63;">Béarn：</span><br>
"Infection?"<br>
<span style="color:#92fc63;">Richelieu：</span><br>
Yes, it reminds me of what I felt when I was purifying the basilicas on Kerguelen Island.<br>
<span style="color:#92fc63;">Béarn：</span><br>
Sorry, but I'm not sure I understand you, Cardinal Richelieu.<br>
I don't believe this area to be a Mirror Sea. At least, none of my equipment indicates anything to that extent.<br>
<span style="color:#92fc63;">Richelieu：</span><br>
Understood. I can't say for certain if it is the same phenomenon, but we should still prioritize repelling the Siren fleet all the same.<br>
Le Terrible, is the Tribunal's secret channel still open?<br>
<span style="color:#92fc63;">Le Terrible：</span><br>
Of course not. I already tried using it several times, but my message didn't go through.<br>
There has to be another way of contacting Marseillaise.<br>
(There's no way all these Siren wreckages were created just by the stronghold's defenses...)<br>
(I fear that Marseillaise jumped into the fray herself...)<br>
(Even though I stressed the importance of her safety, I couldn't get her to listen after all...)<br>
(This is why battle freaks are so hard to deal with...)<br>
<span style="color:#92fc63;">Richelieu：</span><br>
We'll begin engaging the Sirens to draw their attention. Le Terrible, keep looking for a way to get us in touch with Marseillaise.<br>
All ships, start moving towards the coordinates I just sent you! Draw the Sirens away from Saint Helena!<br>
<span style="color:#92fc63;">Le Téméraire：</span><br>
Huh? Isn't this place where the Sirens are most densely concentrated?<br>
<span style="color:#92fc63;">Richelieu：</span><br>
Yes. Look at it this way – if the Sirens don't want to deploy their forces somewhere, then we shouldn't either.<br>
Be careful when you're fighting. I have a bad feeling about that "infected" area...<br>

<br>
Present day - Saint Helena Island<br>
KABOOM––!!<br>
With a sudden explosion, two new figures burst onto the battlefield.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">La Galissonnière：</span><br>
Ahahaha! That's more like it!<br>
This is the kind of entertainment I've been craving!<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Algérie：</span><br>
Now, now, La Galissonnière. You know I haven't given the order to attack, right?<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">La Galissonnière：</span><br>
Ahaha~♪ Whoops, guess I got a bit carried away.<br>
<span style="color:#92fc63;">Richelieu：</span><br>
Algérie? And La Galissonnière?<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">La Galissonnière：</span><br>
Uhh, huh?<br>
Aw, shit... Looks like our cover just got blown. Should we go over and talk to her?<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Algérie：</span><br>
.........*sigh*.........<br>
<span style="color:#92fc63;">Richelieu：</span><br>
I haven't seen the two of you since the Skybound Wall incident.<br>
I'm glad to see that you're both doing well.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Algérie：</span><br>
Likewise, Cardinal Richelieu. It's been quite a while since that battle.<br>
And you seem to be doing just fine yourself.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">La Galissonnière：</span><br>
What about me? I'm still as kick-ass as ever and, uhh...<br>
Umm...<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Algérie：</span><br>
......<br>
<span style="color:#92fc63;">Le Terrible：</span><br>
What's wrong, La Galissonnière? It's rare to see you at a loss for words.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">La Galissonnière：</span><br>
C'mon, give me some credit here... Even I know how to read a room, sometimes!<br>
More importantly... You... You're the real Le Terrible, right? I'm not just seeing things, right?<br>
<span style="color:#92fc63;">Le Terrible：</span><br>
Real? Why wouldn't I be...<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Algérie：</span><br>
That really is you, isn't it? Where have you been this entire time?<br>
When you suddenly disappeared... All this time, we could only assume the worst...<br>
The awful rumors were everywhere. They were saying you had already sunk...<br>
<span style="color:#92fc63;">Le Terrible：</span><br>
...Huh?<br>
I have been pretty busy, but my whereabouts haven't been leaked after all this time?<br>
You really had no idea where I was this entire time?<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">La Galissonnière：</span><br>
Of course not! You never reached out to any of us!<br>
<span style="color:#92fc63;">Le Terrible：</span><br>
Well, yeah. The Tribunal gave me a secret mission.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">La Galissonnière：</span><br>
That's my point exactly! I'm also a part of the Tribunal, so isn't it worse that you didn't contact your colleagues at all?<br>
<span style="color:#92fc63;">Le Terrible：</span><br>
The Tribunal isn't a sports team, you know. Isn't it standard procedure to keep our work secret from one another?<br>
Just like how I have no idea why the two of you are here right now.<br>
So, let's hear it. What business do you have with us?<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">La Galissonnière：</span><br>
Uhhh...<br>
<span style="color:#92fc63;">Le Terrible：</span><br>
Let's not worry about it then. More importantly, you can see the state Saint Helena Island is in right now.<br>
Which brings me to my proposal: Let's not worry about internal politics right now, and join up to defeat the Sirens.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">La Galissonnière：</span><br>
...What do you think, Algérie?<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Algérie：</span><br>
Le Terrible brought the Cardinal here for a reason, so she should be fully aware of whatever secrets are hidden here.<br>
It doesn't do us any good to keep our cards too close to our chest at this point, right?<br>
So here's the deal. We were sent by the Tribunal for two purposes: to go to Saint Helena Island to facilitate the retrieval of the Crown of the Holy See, and to escort Marseillaise back home.<br>
<span style="color:#92fc63;">Le Terrible：</span><br>
I knew it... The same thing we were told.<br>
(What are you up to, Clemenceau? Why give the same task to both Iris Libre and the Vichya Dominion?)<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Algérie：</span><br>
I see. In that case... We have no choice but to fight.<br>
<span style="color:#92fc63;">Le Terrible：</span><br>
Perhaps not, Lady Algérie.<br>
We both have the same objectives, no? To retrieve the Crown, and rescue Marseillaise.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Algérie：</span><br>
Get to the point.<br>
<span style="color:#92fc63;">Le Terrible：</span><br>
Hear me out – I'm not joking here. I actually just managed to locate Marseillaise.<br>
...Hmm? But, why would she be there...<br>
Béarn, hurry and send recon planes to the coordinates I just gave you!<br>
Pay attention to the cliff areas in particular! We should be able to find Marseillaise there!<br>
<span style="color:#92fc63;">Béarn：</span><br>
The cliffs...?<br>
<span style="color:#92fc63;">Le Terrible：</span><br>
I don't know why she'd leave the secret stronghold and locate herself on such a conspicuous cliffside.<br>
<span style="color:#92fc63;">Richelieu：</span><br>
Wait, those coordinates... That's the area the Sirens seem to be avoiding on purpose, no?<br>
Béarn, please be careful. We don't know what dangers we might encounter there.<br>
<span style="color:#92fc63;">Béarn：</span><br>
Understood. I'll be in touch shortly, Cardinal.<br>
Cardinal Richelieu, my recon planes have detected an anomalous situation.<br>
It seems that your premonitions were right on the mark.<br>
The area indicated by the coordinates is steeped in a black-and-red haze, similar to the Infection encountered on Kerguelen.<br>
There also seems to be an enemy force inside the haze– Wait, it can't be...<br>
There are unidentified enemies approaching from land, air, and sea! And Marseillaise seems to already be locked in combat with them!<br>
<span style="color:#92fc63;">Richelieu：</span><br>
Unidentified? Are they not Sirens?<br>
<span style="color:#92fc63;">Béarn：</span><br>
That's correct... I can't identify their shapes at all through my planes' cameras... I've never seen anything like it before.<br>
<span style="color:#92fc63;">Le Terrible：</span><br>
(An unidentified enemy... appearing alongside a strange haze...)<br>
(Is that why Marseillaise decided to leave the stronghold?)<br>
(In any case, if these enemies make their way into the mountains, we'll completely lose control over the situation.)<br>
<span style="color:#92fc63;">Richelieu：</span><br>
Le Terrible, do you know anything about these unidentified enemies?<br>
<span style="color:#92fc63;">Le Terrible：</span><br>
My apologies, but I've never seen or heard of them before.<br>
But it seems possible that the Sirens didn't deploy their troops here to avoid a confrontation with these... things.<br>
What we do know, however, is that Marseillaise is in danger. Algérie, La Galissonnière, let's work out the details later. If we don't act now, we'll all fail our missions.<br>
Richelieu, please bring the main fleet along and follow me.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Algérie：</span><br>
...I see. I suppose rescuing Marseillaise is our top priority for now.<br>
<span style="color:#92fc63;">Le Terrible：</span><br>
As long as you understand. Let's get going.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Algérie：</span><br>
Very well. La Galissonnière, come with me.<br>
<span style="color:#92fc63;">Richelieu：</span><br>
Remember, we're fighting against an unknown foe. Don't take any unnecessary risks, and bring Marseillaise back safely!<br>

{{折叠面板|标题=The Day the Holy City Burned|选项=6|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<br>
Years ago...<br>
Capital of the Iris Orthodoxy<br>
Marseillaise's recollection<br>
The Iris Orthodoxy's shining Holy City was consumed by the flames of conflict.<br>
Its intricate, ornate roads once welcomed back heroes returning from magnificent victories...<br>
But now, upon them rumbled the cold, heartless engines of war.<br>
The gruesome sight of the burning Holy City would soon spread to every corner of the world through every conceivable form of communication.<br>
<span style="color:#92fc63;">Marseillaise：</span><br>
So in the end, all she chose to do was watch from the balcony...<br>
Not just the Tribunal, but even the Templar Knights as well...<br>
Then, I am left with no other choice.<br>
Both the Tribunal and the Templar Knights knew. They both made this decision.<br>
I am the Fighting Angel of the Iris Orthodoxy, and her chief executor. It is not my place to question the orders I have been given.<br>
Even if I am told to lay down my arms, even if I am told to watch our Holy City burn.<br>
Even if the Iris Orthodoxy is to be split in two.<br>
It is not my place, because all I can do is fight.<br>
I know nothing but the Holy Iris' teachings. I cannot say anything.<br>
It is not my place, because I am but a ship, a vessel of war...<br>
Then, I am left with no other choice.<br>
But still, there has to be something I can do.<br>
If I allow myself to be struck down here, if I don't climb back up... how can I be worthy of the title of Fighting Angel?<br>
As long as the Iris Orthodoxy needs me, I will...<br>
I will...<br>
Fight, continue to fight, and never back down––<br>
<br>
Present day<br>
Waters near Saint Helena Island<br>
▇█▎■▄▆▋▂<br>
Richelieu struggled to push through the waters choked with the black-and-red haze, alone.<br>
<span style="color:#92fc63;">Richelieu：</span><br>
What in the world... is this haze?!<br>
The deeper in I go, the more it pushes back against me, like a wall of some sort...<br>
At this rate, I'm not going to be able to breathe...<br>
I... My body's starting to give out on me!<br>
<br>
KABOOM––!!<br>
She mustered her strength, discharging her cannons in a desperate attempt to blow away the haze. However, it quickly flooded back into the area.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">???：</span><br>
Again and again, I fought. Again and again, I failed.<br>
What you are doing now is futile. Utterly meaningless.<br>
Give up, sister.<br>
<span style="color:#92fc63;">Richelieu：</span><br>
Jean... Bart...?<br>
No, you're not Jean Bart at all!<br>
She would never say something like that!<br>
This is just an illusion... Just like the Infection back in the basilica's facility...<br>
Calm down, Richelieu... Don't let your emotions get the better of you...<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">???：</span><br>
Calm down, you say?<br>
Shouldn't you be angry, if anything?<br>
You abandoned your friends, your sister, and even the Iris Orthodoxy...<br>
You've been gritting your teeth, enduring it all until now. But for what? What have you achieved?<br>
Endless ridicule, scorn, slander, and abuse... Nothing else.<br>
So why calm down?<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Richelieu：</span><br>
Don't say another word! Please...<br>
<br>
KABOOM––!!<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">???：</span><br>
Hmph. Now, you finally understand.<br>
Yeah, that's right. Look into the light! Let the wrath flow through you!<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Richelieu：</span><br>
Shut... your... mouth!<br>
<br>
A black sun, quietly burning in the dusky sky.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Richelieu：</span><br>
Please, give me strength... Give me the strength to dispel this illusion!<br>
<br>
In the blink of an eye, the black sun disappeared from her consciousness.<br>
Her mind snapped back to the middle of the ominous haze.<br>
But, this time...<br>
<span style="color:#92fc63;">Richelieu：</span><br>
*pant*... *pant*... I'm finally... free from the illusion...<br>
That overwhelming, crushing aura I felt just now... is also gone...<br>
<br>
Just like it had once before, the banner in her hand shimmered with countless specks of light.<br>
<span style="color:#92fc63;">Richelieu：</span><br>
The light is gradually converging on my banner just as before... Have my prayers been answered?<br>
Has my faith been made manifest?<br>
...I see, so this must be a core component of the Iris Orthodoxy's facilities.<br>
Not just the basilica itself, but the entire idea of conceptual manifestation...<br>
If the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse were a physical application of that phenomenon, then the black sun–<br>
...Clemenceau, what have you done?!<br>
<br>
KABOOM––!!<br>
The sound of distant cannonfire interrupted her thoughts.<br>
<span style="color:#92fc63;">Richelieu：</span><br>
Marseillaise and the others are still fighting out there!<br>
As long as I can wield this power, I have to save everyone!<br>
But, I swear that I will get my answers – about the Tribunal, no, about the Iris' Sacraments.<br>
I swear... that I will lead the Iris Orthodoxy into the future.<br>

Years ago...<br>
Saint Helena Island - Secret Tribunal Stronghold<br>
Marseillaise's recollection<br>
<span style="color:#92fc63;">Le Terrible：</span><br>
So here we are, Marseillaise. The place I told you about.<br>
<span style="color:#92fc63;">Marseillaise：</span><br>
Incredible. When did we excavate such a massive facility deep inside the mountains?<br>
I've never seen any allocations being made for a project of this scale... How many outside channels would the Tribunal have needed to go through?<br>
And how did it secure the permissions and funding to construct something like this?<br>
<span style="color:#92fc63;">Le Terrible：</span><br>
Extraordinary circumstances call for extraordinary measures. Is that not why the Tribunal keeps spare change lying around?<br>
I'm not overly concerned about the specifics.<br>
Setting aside the motivations of the higher-ups, the Tribunal has always been a shadowy organization. It's only natural that they have secrets they don't want the general public to know.<br>
<span style="color:#92fc63;">Marseillaise：</span><br>
The Naval HQ has always been wary of the power held by the Tribunal.<br>
With this, I can see why they've thought that.<br>
<span style="color:#92fc63;">Le Terrible：</span><br>
Goodness, Marseillaise. Is it really the right time to nip at the hand that feeds you?<br>
In any case, you are now the master of this estate. The Tribunal's secret stronghold is in your hands.<br>
Remember the sacred order given to you – protect the Crown of the Holy See.<br>
<span style="color:#92fc63;">Marseillaise：</span><br>
You're not going to stand guard here with me?<br>
<span style="color:#92fc63;">Le Terrible：</span><br>
Unfortunately, I have no shortage of work to attend to.<br>
There are too many other areas that require my attention, so...<br>
Yes, while I am certainly loathe to leave you on your lonesome, this is also the Holy Iris' will. We both have been given our respective duties.<br>
I will be back sometime later to check on you, so bear with it until then.<br>
<span style="color:#92fc63;">Marseillaise：</span><br>
Understood. I, the Fighting Angel of the Iris Orthodoxy, swear to protect this Crown with my life.<br>
<span style="color:#92fc63;">Le Terrible：</span><br>
...Well, we did say before that the Crown is just an object.<br>
It's not worth losing your life over. Remember, if at any point, you are forced to choose between it and your life, I want you to choose the latter without hesitation.<br>
...The Iris Orthodoxy has already had to make too many sacrifices.<br>
<br>
Present day<br>
Waters near Saint Helena Island<br>
▇█▎■▄▆▋▂<br>
The haze continued to spread until it even blotted out the moonlight.<br>
The formless mass of black and red writhed and extended outwards, as if it had a will of its own.<br>
If one listened closely, it almost seemed like there was a distant howl drifting along the wind.<br>
<span style="color:#92fc63;">Marseillaise：</span><br>
I knew this day would come...<br>
Agents of evil who would seek to snatch the Crown... Conceal your appearances as much you like, but you cannot hide your vile intent.<br>
You stand on hallowed ground, a bastion that protects our Sacraments from the enemies of the Iris Orthodoxy.<br>
Even if you have torn through the boundary of possibility to invade this place, it is my honor to stand unflinching against you.<br>
My apologies, Le Terrible.<br>
I am the fighting angel of the Iris Orthodoxy. To do battle is my purpose.<br>
If I am forced to choose between my life and the Crown, I will always choose the Crown without hesitation.<br>
No matter what kind of situation I find myself in, no matter what kind of enemy I face.<br>
You shall not lay a finger upon the Sacrament of the Crown!<br>
Demons and heretics that would seek to sully what is sacred––<br>
In the glorious name of the Holy Iris, I shall destroy you!<br>
<br>
The angel's pure, unyielding will to protect manifested itself into power, pushing the formless foes back again and again.<br>
But, the enemy's numbers were limitless.<br>
And she had already pushed herself beyond her limits. Little by little, the girl was cornered into a cliff overlooking the ocean.<br>
One more step would push her not into the sea's embrace, but rather the embrace of defeat. At last, she had nowhere left to go.<br>
<span style="color:#92fc63;">Marseillaise：</span><br>
So this... is how it ends...<br>
<br>
Just at that time, she saw a glimmer of light from beyond the haze that choked her vision.<br>
<span style="color:#92fc63;">Marseillaise：</span><br>
That light... that voice... Is that you, Cardinal Richelieu?<br>
But, why are you here...?<br>
No, now's not the time to think about that... I must keep fighting on!<br>
<br>
Having found hope once more, the girl once again lifted her sword, the radiance from the blade parting the mist for a brief moment.<br>
As fleeting as it was, that moment was enough to clearly reveal Richelieu, approaching with her glistening banner held high.<br>
<span style="color:#92fc63;">Marseillaise：</span><br>
Cardinal! I hereby entrust the Crown to you!<br>
Please, you must ensure the Crown's safety!!<br>
<br>
With the last of her might, Marseillaise threw the Crown towards the holy light.<br>
As soon as the Crown left her hand, the girl was swallowed up by the surging haze and disappeared within its depths.<br>

<br>
>>Our forces have been defeated.<br>
>>The frontlines have collapsed, and the Iron Blood army now advances at full speed.<br>
>>Sardegna has also joined the battle, making the situation even worse.<br>
>>At the orders of the Naval HQ, all troops have been withdrawn from the capital.<br>
>>We are now completely defenseless.<br>
>>I have told the shipgirls to obey this order, so that they may conserve their strength.<br>
>>Additionally, our intel network has entered a latent state and is preparing for long-term warfare.<br>
>>The Templar Knights' shipgirls have been dispersed to various locations and transferred under the command of Jean Bart.<br>
>>But, a number of the Tribunal's ships will continue to act independently and not take orders from the Naval HQ.<br>
>>In the event of conflicting orders, the Tribunal's orders will take precedence over the Naval HQ's.<br>
>>The Cardinal plans to leave the Iris Orthodoxy and temporarily evacuate under the guise of a diplomatic visit to the Royal Navy.<br>
>>...If the arrival of the antediluvial flood is inevitable, then wise is she who prepares the Ark.<br>
After Marseillaise passed on that which she dedicated her life to protecting, the world she perceived around her began to crumble.<br>
Her vision was dyed a swirling mass of black and red, her ears rang with a writhing, squelching sound. Her wavering consciousness was swallowed up by the hazy darkness.<br>
<span style="color:#92fc63;">Marseillaise：</span><br>
What... a terrible... noise...<br>
But, it'll... all be quiet soon.<br>
Soon... everything... will disappear...<br>
<br>
Her eyes started to slowly close, letting her consciousness fade into nothingness.<br>
But just before absolute silence fell, she heard a familiar yet distant voice in her ears.<br>
<span style="color:#92fc63;">Distant Voice：</span><br>
Don't... let go... Hold on... to your consciousness...<br>
You can't... give up...<br>
Please, don't give up!<br>
<br>
A light cut through the endless darkness, like a beacon leading her back to her senses.<br>
<span style="color:#92fc63;">Marseillaise：</span><br>
...Light?<br>
<span style="color:#92fc63;">Richelieu：</span><br>
I, Cardinal Richelieu of the Iris Orthodoxy, hereby declare–<br>
You stand upon hallowed ground, a sanctuary of the Holy Iris.<br>
This land is steeped in the blessings of the most Divine.<br>
Therefore, your ilk shall not be permitted to run amok here.<br>
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust.<br>
By the radiance of my holy banner, I will burn you away from existence!<br>
<br>
The writhing presence screeched as it faded away and disappeared, like fog dispelled by the light of dawn.<br>
As the haze cleared, so too did the ominous aura clawing at the shipgirls there.<br>
Marseillaise slowly climbed to her feet and surveyed her surroundings.<br>
<span style="color:#92fc63;">Marseillaise：</span><br>
It appears you've been able to repel the enemy, Cardinal Richelieu.<br>
But... something still doesn't seem quite right.<br>
<span style="color:#92fc63;">Richelieu：</span><br>
Marseillaise! Are you alright? Are you able to stand?<br>
<span style="color:#92fc63;">Marseillaise：</span><br>
Cardinal... The Crown of the Holy See...<br>
<span style="color:#92fc63;">Richelieu：</span><br>
...I'm sorry, Marseillaise. The Crown... was taken away.<br>
<span style="color:#92fc63;">Marseillaise：</span><br>
No...!<br>
How could this be...<br>
<br>
The gnawing feeling of loneliness, the bitterness of defeat, and the damage she had sustained in battle all rushed in at once.<br>
Combined with the devastating news that just struck her, Marseillaise was overwhelmed and lost consciousness.<br>
<span style="color:#92fc63;">Richelieu：</span><br>
Rest well, my friend. Your efforts will not be in vain.<br>
<br>
Not long afterwards, the rest of the Sirens were defeated, and Marseillaise was transferred to a safe location.<br>
The Crown of the Holy See had disappeared without a trace.<br>
Just like the black and red haze, and the unidentifiable enemy writhing within it.<br>
Only the scarred cliffs, pummeled by intense cannonfire, quietly stood as testimony to the fierce fighting that had broken out there.<br>

<span style="color:#ffd000;">La Galissonnière：</span><br>
I gotta say, the Tribunal sure knows how to build a sturdy fort.<br>
The outside looks like it's been through hell and back, but you'd never be able to tell at all from the inside.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Algérie：</span><br>
You talk too much. There's an injured person here, you know.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">La Galissonnière：</span><br>
Oh, uhh, whoopsies...<br>
<span style="color:#92fc63;">Marseillaise：</span><br>
.........<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">La Galissonnière：</span><br>
Are ya still sulking, Marseillaise?<br>
<span style="color:#92fc63;">Marseillaise：</span><br>
...No. I don't sulk.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">La Galissonnière：</span><br>
You totally ARE sulking! But... I can imagine how frustrating it must be for you right now.<br>
<span style="color:#92fc63;">Marseillaise：</span><br>
...It has nothing to do with you.<br>
<span style="color:#92fc63;">Richelieu：</span><br>
...But, it probably has everything to do with me. You're mad at me, aren't you?<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">La Galissonnière：</span><br>
Oh, you're back, Cardinal~<br>
Is everything holding up okay out there?<br>
<span style="color:#92fc63;">Richelieu：</span><br>
We're just finishing up putting out the fires, and there aren't any signs of Siren reinforcements.<br>
They must've realized that the Crown is no longer here.<br>
<span style="color:#92fc63;">Marseillaise：</span><br>
...We let them get what they came here for.<br>
If only you didn't try to save me back then, and instead protected the Crown––<br>
<span style="color:#92fc63;">Richelieu：</span><br>
That just means, I chose you over the Crown of the Holy See.<br>
If I had just picked up the Crown and ran away, I could have made it out. But you, on the other hand...<br>
<span style="color:#92fc63;">Marseillaise：</span><br>
I am the fighting angel of the Iris Orthodoxy. It was my sacred duty to protect the Crown, even if it cost me my life.<br>
<span style="color:#92fc63;">Richelieu：</span><br>
I'm not throwing your life away... Just like I'm not going to leave behind any of the Iris Orthodoxy's children ever again.<br>
This is the choice that I made. Not the Crown, but the life of my friend, Marseillaise.<br>
I am sorry for trampling over your convictions.<br>
But, no matter how many times I am confronted with this choice, I will make the same decision every time.<br>
Even if the Crown is a symbol of the Iris Orthodoxy's legitimacy, I will not sacrifice my friends for it.<br>
<span style="color:#92fc63;">Marseillaise：</span><br>
Cardinal Richelieu... I simply can't understand you after all...<br>
<br>
Marseillaise seemed to have more to say, but instead closed her eyes and remained silent.<br>
<span style="color:#92fc63;">Richelieu：</span><br>
Please rest well for now, Marseillaise.<br>
<br>
Waters near Saint Helena Island<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Algérie：</span><br>
Richelieu, I believe this is where we bid each other farewell.<br>
<span style="color:#92fc63;">Richelieu：</span><br>
Hmm? Algérie?<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Algérie：</span><br>
I wasn't able to secure the Crown, so there's no point in staying around any longer.<br>
I now have to go back and consult with Clemenceau to see what our next course of action is.<br>
As for Marseillaise... I trust she's in capable hands.<br>
<span style="color:#92fc63;">Richelieu：</span><br>
Algérie... Even now, you're not willing to come with us?<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Algérie：</span><br>
We each have our own goals and perspectives, Richelieu. Let's just leave it at that.<br>
<span style="color:#92fc63;">Le Terrible：</span><br>
Not so fast. Stay put, both of you.<br>
As an acting agent of the Iris Libre Navy, I hereby announce the following to La Galissonnière and Algérie of the Vichya Dominion Navy.<br>
You have trespassed in an Iris Libre facility without authorization, and have engaged in suspicious activities against the Iris Libre fleet.<br>
You are to stop right now and surrender yourselves, or I have no choice but to forcefully detain you.<br>
Legal talk aside, I have you completely surrounded. Come with me quietly.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">La Galissonnière：</span><br>
...Haha, for a moment there, I forgot about that whole Iris Libre and Vichya thing~<br>
It felt a bit too natural for us to team up and fight together, you know. Hrmmm...<br>
Algérie, I don't like our odds right now. Are you gonna get mad at me if I surrender?<br>
C'mon, we weren't able to retrieve the Crown. Even if we go back, what are we supposed to say to Clemenceau?<br>
She said that failure wouldn't be tolerated, right? But she didn't say anything about surrender.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Algérie：</span><br>
.........<br>
So this is what you've been gunning for all along? I must say, I'm rather unimpressed.<br>
In the end, you know that there's no way I can just throw my hands up and turn myself in.<br>
<span style="color:#92fc63;">Richelieu：</span><br>
...I'm just as surprised as you are, though I'm sure you're not going to believe me.<br>
But, Algérie, I want you to know this.<br>
Iris Libre and the Vichya Dominion are two parts of one whole. Everything I've done is for the sake of restoring the one Iris Orthodoxy.<br>
No matter what trials await me, no matter how hard I have to try, my resolve will not waver.<br>
I will never give in, not until the Iris Orthodoxy is made whole once more.<br>
I'm sure that Clemenceau and the Tribunal, Jean Bart and the Templar Knights... all feel the same way.<br>
Indeed, we have fought against each other as enemies. But, only because we chose different paths towards the same destination.<br>
Thanks to everyone's efforts, we have protected our Sacraments, made our basilicas secure, and defended the safety of our waters.<br>
We've already shown that we can work hand in hand towards the same goal, so what reason is there for us to remain split?<br>
Deep down, you already know the answer, don't you?<br>
The flames of old hatreds have been extinguished. Former enemies now fight side-by-side, and the World Expo has shown that there is more that unites us than separates us.<br>
Even though the progress may seem slow, the world is moving forward, step by step.<br>
Of course, there will always be those who benefit from Iris Libre and the Vichya Dominion remaining divided.<br>
But, we cannot let them drive a wedge between us.<br>
We must continue to stride forward, and not dwell upon the mistakes of the past.<br>
Algérie, I know that you're not simply "following orders" from the higher-ups.<br>
You know full well that we must usher in the Iris Orthodoxy's future, and never let it be swept away by sinister undercurrents.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Algérie：</span><br>
Richelieu...<br>
<span style="color:#92fc63;">Richelieu：</span><br>
I implore you, Algérie, please fight with us once more.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Algérie：</span><br>
If I defect, Clemenceau will–<br>
<span style="color:#92fc63;">Richelieu：</span><br>
I know that girl well. She knows how to take care of herself.<br>
Besides, it won't be long until we can go visit her, with all our Vichya friends as one.<br>
<span style="color:#92fc63;">Le Terrible：</span><br>
However, if you still need more time to consider, feel free to use the facility here at Saint Helena "forever."<br>
Though, we'll be breathing down your neck the whole time, so I'm sure you won't enjoy those arrangements.<br>
In any case, I've said what I needed to say.<br>
Just think about how nice it would be to once again fight under the banner of the Iris Orthodoxy, and not have to worry about petty factions.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Algérie：</span><br>
Hah... I have no other choice then.<br>
I suppose getting threatened and getting a sweetheart deal cancel each other out.<br>
Having all that said though, Richelieu, don't let your idealism get the better of you. You can't erase the scars of the past, or pretend none of it ever happened.<br>
<span style="color:#92fc63;">Richelieu：</span><br>
I know. That's why we will create a new path forward.<br>
<span style="color:#92fc63;">Algérie：</span><br>
Step bravely into a brighter tomorrow, rather than waiting for yesterday's darkness to dissipate, huh?<br>
<span style="color:#92fc63;">Richelieu：</span><br>
Welcome home, Algérie.<br>

Saint Helena Island - Inside the Tribunal Facility<br>
After an eventful night, the ships gathered in the Tribunal facility decided on their next course of action.<br>
<span style="color:#92fc63;">Marseillaise：</span><br>
We should prioritize locating and recapturing the Crown of the Holy See.<br>
Even if it is symbolic in nature, we mustn't let it fall into the wrong hands.<br>
<span style="color:#92fc63;">Le Terrible：</span><br>
As I said before, it has little intrinsic value on its own, but I do share Marseillaise's sentiments.<br>
Without the Crown in hand, you might find a number of things more difficult to accomplish, Cardinal Richelieu.<br>
More importantly, we cannot ignore the new enemy that attacked us and snatched it away.<br>
<span style="color:#92fc63;">Richelieu：</span><br>
Indeed. The reasons you've provided are sound, and I also see the importance in recapturing it.<br>
However, I am more worried about the Sirens and this new unknown enemy than the Crown itself.<br>
How did they manage to locate the secret facility housing it, and what were they planning to do with it?<br>
Finally, what is the relationship between the Arbiters, Infection, and the mysterious enemy? We must find the answers to these questions as soon as possible.<br>
<span style="color:#92fc63;">La Galissonnière：</span><br>
Say, do you mind if I head back to the Tribunal for now?<br>
I mean, nobody knows what happened here yesterday except us, right?<br>
I can just walk in like nothing happened and be a totally badass spy, then use the Tribunal's extensive intel network to search for leads.<br>
<span style="color:#92fc63;">Algérie：</span><br>
Risky, but a potentially rewarding option. What do you think, Richelieu?<br>
<span style="color:#92fc63;">Richelieu：</span><br>
That's true. I might be able to get a glimpse into the workings of the Naval HQ, as well as how things are faring back in the Iris Orthodoxy homeland...<br>
<span style="color:#92fc63;">La Galissonnière：</span><br>
We're all on the same page then? In that case, I'm gonna get ready to head back! Man, being a double agent is gonna be sooooo much fun!<br>
<span style="color:#92fc63;">Le Terrible：</span><br>
Oh, right. Before you go, let me give you a bit more information about this secret stronghold.<br>
The Crown wasn't the only thing special about Saint Helena Island.<br>
There are a number of important Tribunal assets stored here, and I expect them to come into play sooner rather than later...<br>
Who knows? You might even find something that you can use to your benefit.<br>
But, there's a lot of ground to cover, so you may find it in your best interest to remain here a while longer.<br>
<span style="color:#92fc63;">La Galissonnière：</span><br>
Ehh? Don't we have a whole bunch of people here already? Do you absolutely need me to stay as well?<br>
Wouldn't it be better for us to spread out and get as much info as we can?<br>
<span style="color:#92fc63;">Le Terrible：</span><br>
Sure, if you're fine with the possibility of getting your cover blown without anyone to bail you out.<br>
<span style="color:#92fc63;">La Galissonnière：</span><br>
...Hmm, you do have a point.<br>
<span style="color:#92fc63;">Le Terrible：</span><br>
I'm not saying you have to stay here forever. Just know that if we can fully secure this facility for ourselves, we'll be able to use it as our base of operations.<br>
In the meantime, I think we've all earned ourselves some time to rest and recuperate.<br>
<span style="color:#92fc63;">Richelieu：</span><br>
In other words, let's not get too ahead of ourselves right now.<br>
I'm not opposed to you returning to the Tribunal, but let's follow Le Terrible's suggestions first.<br>
<span style="color:#92fc63;">Le Terrible：</span><br>
Good. So, can we all agree on that plan?<br>
Ah, yes. One last thing. La Galissonnière, do you still have that "medicine" from the Tribunal?<br>
Cardinal Richelieu, the nightmares you've been seeing may be related to one of the basilica's mechanisms.<br>
<span style="color:#92fc63;">Richelieu：</span><br>
Wait, there's medication for my nightmares...?<br>
<span style="color:#92fc63;">Le Terrible：</span><br>
It's just speculation on my part, but the nightmares began since you were exposed to the basilicas in Kerguelen, right?<br>
A number of the Tribunal's people sent to work in and around the facilities reported a number of strange symptoms, so they started issuing these to alleviate some of the side effects.<br>
<span style="color:#92fc63;">La Galissonnière：</span><br>
Gimme a sec. I think I happen to have some on me...<br>
<br>
La Galissonnière dug around and retrieved a tightly-sealed phial with liquid inside of it.<br>
<span style="color:#92fc63;">La Galissonnière：</span><br>
Huh, I never really connected the dots before, but this much should do the trick. Here, give it a try.<br>
<span style="color:#92fc63;">Le Terrible：</span><br>
Make that two. Leave one here for me as well.<br>
<span style="color:#92fc63;">La Galissonnière：</span><br>
Huh...?<br>
<span style="color:#92fc63;">Le Terrible：</span><br>
Something wrong?<br>
<br>
La Galissonnièr pondered for a moment, but decided not to question it. She fetched a second phial, and placed it on the table next to Le Terrible.<br>
<span style="color:#92fc63;">Le Terrible：</span><br>
Thank you very much.<br>
Now onto the next topic of interest, Cardinal Richelieu––<br>
<br>
Record of a past broadcast–<br>
>>I have asked the enemy to cease all acts of aggression.<br>
>>It brings me no pleasure to make this decision, but there is no other choice.<br>
>>Some will feel numbness in their hearts when they hear these words.<br>
>>Perhaps it is relief, perhaps it is paralysis caused by the harshness of reality.<br>
>>Some may see this act as despicable, but it will be worth it in the end.<br>
>>Some will be outraged, and some will grieve.<br>
>>Some may feel wrath rise up within them, and direct it at the person who made this decision.<br>
>>Let that anger become fertile soil for resistance to take root, and take the first step towards victory.<br>
>>The Iris Orthodoxy's battle is over.<br>
>>But, my battle has only just begun–<br>
