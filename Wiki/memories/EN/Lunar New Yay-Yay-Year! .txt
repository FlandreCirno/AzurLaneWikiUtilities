Lunar New Year!<br>
<br>
Chapter 1 - The Start of a New Adventure!<br>
Port - Dragon Empery Dorm<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
It's Lunar New Year! I wish you all an auspicious and Happy New Year as one big family! Heheh!<br>
How was that? That was a proper New Year's greeting, right?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">An Shan：</span><br>
No, don't add "heheh" at the end! Greetings are serious business!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
So the greeting itself was fine, then! Alright, let's head out to play some games!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">An Shan：</span><br>
Hold it! People are busy with their preparations, and I'm not letting you go out and cause trouble for them!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Tsk. Lame~ Oh, I know! Can I go help hang up the lanterns?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">An Shan：</span><br>
I'm not letting you sneak away when nobody's looking! ...Tai Yuan, keep an eye on Fu Shun and make sure she doesn't go anywhere.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tai Yuan：</span><br>
Okay, I will. But... keeping a close eye on Fu Shun can be pretty difficult...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kimberly：</span><br>
An Shan, we'd like to ask for your help in the kitchen.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mullany：</span><br>
I-it's so weird... I followed the recipe almost to a T...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kimberly：</span><br>
But we've clearly created some kind of Frankenstein dish...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mullany：</span><br>
I-I guess I just thought I'd innovate on the recipe a little... Please, An Shan, help us~!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">An Shan：</span><br>
Okay! I'll come help right away!<br>
Things are so hectic now that everyone has their hands full... Fu Shun, Tai Yuan, go help those who need it!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
You got it~ Good luck in the kitchen, An Shan!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tai Yuan：</span><br>
Now then, Fu Shun, should we go get the lanterns?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Heheh, truth is, those have already been hung up! And now that An Shan's left, I can finally go have some fun!<br>
Why don't you come with me? I just thought of something SUPER fun we could do!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tai Yuan：</span><br>
Come with you?! B-but An Shan told us to...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Don't worry about it, nobody will notice. We're just going to check if there's any gunpowder lying around the base to make firecrackers with~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tai Yuan：</span><br>
F-firecrackers?! B-but that's dangerous... We shouldn't play with...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
What's a Lunar New Year without firecrackers? Come on, do as your big sister says and let's go for a quick lookie. It'll be fun!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tai Yuan：</span><br>
But... Umm, please let go of my hand, Fu Shun... At least let me walk on my own...<br>

Lunar New Year!<br>
<br>
Chapter 2 - Old Warehouse, New Discovery<br>
Port - Academy Plaza<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tai Yuan：</span><br>
Ugh... Where are we even supposed to find gunpowder...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Ahahah... To be honest, I'm not really sure either! Let's start by asking around!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tai Yuan：</span><br>
We can ask, but if they don't know either, then... Hey, who's that over there?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Yo! It's Ayanami! And Laffey, too! Who's your new friend?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:6}：</span><br>
This is Yuugure. I don't believe you've met before.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:32}：</span><br>
Ah... Nice to meet you. I'm Yuugure. I hope we can be friends.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Nice meeting you~ Hey, aren't you guys wearing new clothes? That's gotta be Dragon Empery-style!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tai Yuan：</span><br>
Ayanami, Laffey, and Yuugure in new clothes... You look so cute in them...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:32}：</span><br>
We worked on them together.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
Yeah, we did... We spent a long time making them.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:6}：</span><br>
Longer than we'd expected to, yes... But it's fine since we made in time for the Lunar New Year.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Wow, that's really nice~ Oh right, I was gonna ask you guys something!<br>
We're doing something special for Lunar New Year and we're looking for some gunpowder to make firecrackers. Do you know where we could find some?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:6}：</span><br>
...Yes, there should be some that we previously used to make fireworks with in the old warehouse.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Oh, really? In the old warehouse? Heheheh, I didn't think we'd be able to find some this quickly~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
Oh, I love firecrackers!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
They're really fun. They're even better when you make them yourself, though. Then you won't know quite what to expect!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
That sounds like it might be fun... I wanna make some too...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:6}：</span><br>
Firecrackers are dangerous... But, when used responsibly... in sober mind... they can be quite fun.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:32}：</span><br>
T-to the old warehouse? I-I think I'll have to pass... My sister Ariake is waiting for me, and the old warehouse is just a little too dark and scary for me...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:6}：</span><br>
Okay. Take care on the way back, Yuugure.<br>
<br>
Port - Old Warehouse<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:6}：</span><br>
...I found it. Over here.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Hehehehe~! So we've got the gunpowder, now we'll just...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
I found this thing... oh it's Momopoly...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:6}：</span><br>
I found something as well. It's called a sugoroku board... I think?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
You found something? Lemme see!<br>
Oh, this thing's called Shengguan Tu... Actually, I'm pretty sure they call it "Momopoly" in the Eagle Union, and "sugoroku" in the Sakura Empire, right?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey & Ayanami & Fu Shun：</span><br>
…I have an idea…<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tai Yuan：</span><br>
Instead of making firecrackers, how about we just play...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Then it's settled. After we've made firecrackers, we'll play some of this! Heheh, I'll have you know I'm really good at games like these!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey & Ayanami：</span><br>
Wow, that's cool.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tai Yuan：</span><br>
W-wait, what about my idea...<br>

Lunar New Year!<br>
<br>
Chapter 3 - An Explosive New Year!<br>
Port - Dragon Empery Garden<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
...This thing... then put this here...<br>
Alright, the firecracker is finished! I'm so good at crafting stuff!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tai Yuan：</span><br>
F-Fu Shun, isn't that firecracker a little too big...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
That's no problem! The larger they are, the more fun they are! Okay, guys, step back a bit, I'll light the fuse!<br>
Woohoo! Now witness the might of my specially made, extra large New Year's firecracker!<br>
<br>
BOOOM!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">An Shan：</span><br>
W-what was that noise?! Was it you, Fu Shun?! I know you're up to something again!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Oh, crap, An Shan's here... Yikes, guys! I guess we shouldn't have used a whole barrel of gunpowder, ahaha...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tai Yuan：</span><br>
Owww... Your firecrackers are scary, Fu Shun! ...I'm sorry, An Shan, I just couldn't stop her...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">An Shan：</span><br>
...Fu Shun! Get over here right now!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:6}：</span><br>
Owch... My head is spinning...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
"Bang bang"... That sounded more like a bomb...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
What's going on? Are we under attack?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lexington：</span><br>
I heard a really loud bang so I came running here... Is everyone okay?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
Huh? Laffey, what are you doing here? And what the hell was that noise?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
The bang-bang firecracker Fu Shun made turned out to be a lot more powerful than we thought...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">An Shan：</span><br>
I'm so sorry, Enterprise and Lexington. My little sister must've alarmed you terribly... Fu Shun! Apologize with me, right now!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Sob... I'm sorry...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lexington：</span><br>
I'm just glad you weren't hurt... But still, a firecracker, huh... Usually, we only light those in celebration of a holiday...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">An Shan：</span><br>
Indeed, firecrackers are quite common during Lunar New Year... We have a legend about a monster named Nian Shou that's driven away by the sound of firecrackers. Although anyone could agree Fu Shun tried too hard...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
I see, it's to drive away a monster, huh. Dragon Empery culture sounds pretty interesting.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">An Shan：</span><br>
Since Kimberly and Mullany just came here to learn how to cook, and you're here now too... why don't you stay and enjoy some of the food we made, as an apology of sorts...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chang Chun：</span><br>
Oh, and if you'll wait a little, the commander and some others are gonna come too~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
Uh, I don't think it warrants an apology. But... I'm curious what your cuisine is like, and it would be rude to refuse. What about you, Lexington?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lexington：</span><br>
I wouldn't mind either. We've never tried your cuisine before, so if anything you'll have to pardon us if we unknowingly do anything impolite.<br>

Lunar New Year!<br>
<br>
Chapter 4 - Peaceful Game<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Oh, I landed on Community Chest! "Bank error in your favor. Collect 200 bucks."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tai Yuan：</span><br>
Geesh... Your luck is out of this world, Fu Shun...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
Fu Shun... is OP...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:6}：</span><br>
She's unstoppable now...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Heheheh, I win! This sugoroku... Momopoly... Shengguan Tu... whatever it is, sure is fun!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chang Chun：</span><br>
An Shan made some tea for you guys. Here you go~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
Thank you. Also, I've been thinking: we all celebrate New Year, but it seems like the Lunar New Year is much more leisurely.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chang Chun：</span><br>
Yep, it's true~ You get to eat lots of yummy food and nobody has work so you get to relax all day~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tai Yuan：</span><br>
You don't have to work and you can relax... B-but there's much more to the Lunar New Year than just that!<br>
Like hanging up lanterns, decorating with couplets... Oh, that reminds me, we haven't done that yet...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lexington：</span><br>
Then may we help with that? We have to repay you for the lovely tea you made for us.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
Definitely. I'd love to get to return your hospitality.<br>
<br>
Port - Plaza<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Belfast：</span><br>
Master graciously offered me this elegant dress, however, I'm afraid that wearing it is rather...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Centaur：</span><br>
Embarrassing, isn't it...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Monarch：</span><br>
If the people of the Dragon Empery celebrate Lunar New Year in these clothes, then we should not be ashamed of wearing them either.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Curacoa：</span><br>
While I do agree with what Monarch is saying, I believe we should proceed to the Dragon Empery dorm to deliver these goods our Master requested.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Curlew：</span><br>
I concur.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Belfast：</span><br>
Miss Chaser, Miss Centaur, Miss Monarch, I must thank you for your cooperation.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Centaur：</span><br>
Not at all, it is an honour to be of service to you!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Monarch：</span><br>
Hmph, no need to thank me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chaser：</span><br>
Ahahah, I'll come with you. I was just thinking of having a nice chat with some girls from the Dragon Empery♪<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Belfast：</span><br>
...What a truly fascinating holiday the Lunar New Year is.<br>

Lunar New Year!<br>
<br>
Chapter 5 - Celebrating Together (Part 1)<br>
*Knock knock*<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">An Shan：</span><br>
I'll get it! ...Ah, it's the Royal Navy! Please, come on in.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Belfast：</span><br>
I hope you are having a pleasant evening. I am Belfast of the Royal Maid Fleet, and these are my companions. We have come to deliver goods as per the commander's request.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">An Shan：</span><br>
Thank you so much! We're really glad you could deliver these for us!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chang Chun：</span><br>
Hehehe~ Happy New Year! Oh wow, look at your Dragon Empery-style clothes~ You're all so pretty!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Monarch：</span><br>
It was the commander's suggestion. We were told to experience the Lunar New Year mood. I must say I enjoy how elegant and stylish these clothes are.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chaser：</span><br>
Good evening~ Ahh, finally a warm house to come into. The Dragon Empery's dorm and garden have such a heartwarming atmosphere.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lexington：</span><br>
Ah, the Royal Navy is here as well?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Belfast：</span><br>
Miss Lexington, Miss Enterprise, it is pleasant to see you again. What is that you're...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
They're helping us hang up the couplets!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
Oh, it's the Royal Navy girls! It's been a while.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lexington：</span><br>
Oh, they're wearing traditional Dragon Empery clothing as well.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Monarch：</span><br>
That's right. Let me guess: you're also wearing them because the commander asked you to...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chaser：</span><br>
I bought mine from Akashi out of my own pocket. Believe it or not. I have quite a few connections to the Dragon Empery. Ahaha~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Belfast：</span><br>
And we in the Maid Fleet made our own. Our Master occasionally wishes to see us wearing clothes from another country.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
I see. As for mine, Laffey and Victorious made it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lexington：</span><br>
And mine is a theatrical dress. What do you think of this new direction Lady Lex is going in? Ahaha~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">An Shan：</span><br>
Since everyone's here, why don't we have a nian ye fan... Er, I mean New Year's Eve meal together?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Belfast：</span><br>
A New Year's party, in other words? I believe that too is one of the Lunar New Year customs the commander spoke of.<br>
The goods we delivered also contain enough food for all of the guests. As recompense for having us, please allow us to assist you with the preparations.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">An Shan：</span><br>
Please, you don't need to. A good host shouldn't let their guests help them like this.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
Are you sure you don't want us to do anything to help?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lexington：</span><br>
Maybe we could help prepare some of this food...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
An Shaaaan! Yat Sen's asking for help bringing out the food!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Centaur：</span><br>
I can help with that too!<br>

Lunar New Year!<br>
<br>
Chapter 6 - Celebrating Together (Part 2)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">An Shan：</span><br>
Now then, my dear guests, I hope you'll enjoy the food! We have seconds if you want more!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Let's dig in! But everything looks yummy, what should I start with first...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chang Chun：</span><br>
Hehehe~ I can't wait to dig into this hong shao yu, it smells delish~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tai Yuan：</span><br>
Calm down, Fu Shun, you don't need to get up on the table!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Centaur：</span><br>
When there's this much food on the table, it becomes hard to choose which to eat first... Ah, something on your mind, Enterprise?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
...Oh, I just thinking about how nice it is that we're all here in one place... All around the same table, having such a good time.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lexington：</span><br>
Aha, festivities like these make me want to sing~ But perhaps today, the food matters more.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
Nom... Dragon Empery food is so yummy...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ayanami：</span><br>
Laffey, you're supposed to hold the chopsticks like this, then pick up the food with it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Belfast：</span><br>
There are quite a few foods here that I think could easily be added to the Royal Navy menu to help give it a little variety.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tai Yuan：</span><br>
...It doesn't look like the commander made it in time to eat with us...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
That's okay! There's more enough left for one person! We can deliver it once we're done!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chaser：</span><br>
Besides, we have the commander to thank for being able to enjoy this feast together.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Belfast：</span><br>
I shall personally see to it our Master also gets to savour this delicious food, so please allow me to make the delivery.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Whew, I'm stuffed! Yat Sen's homemade food deserves 5 stars! Now it's time for... Heheheh...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
I'm totally stuffed... and when I get stuffed, I get sleepy...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
If everyone's had their fill, what do you say we have a Momopoly showdown, Royal ladies? Maybe we should give you a handicap too, since this game was made in the Union?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Monarch：</span><br>
Are you challenging me? Then come! My unrivalled excellence shall be proven to you on this board!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lexington：</span><br>
Sounds interesting. May I play as well?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Centaur：</span><br>
Eek! T-the lights just went off...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chang Chun：</span><br>
Wah! Someone turned off the lights... I haven't even finished eating yet...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">？？？：</span><br>
GRRRRAAAAWWWHHH!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Belfast：</span><br>
That noise...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
Is that... the Nian Shou...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">An Shan：</span><br>
No, that can't be, it's just a myth...<br>

Lunar New Year!<br>
<br>
Chapter 7 - A Lively, Happy New Year<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tai Yuan：</span><br>
Unf... Flipping the light switch doesn't do anything... I think the breaker has tripped.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
It's pitch black... I'm just gonna sleep. Night night...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Belfast：</span><br>
I hear something...! I believe there is something down the hallway, drawing closer.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
I think there is something at the end of the hallway...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">An Shan：</span><br>
C-could it really be...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
(Mwahaha, my plan's going smoothly! Now I just need to use my Custom-Made Firecracker Machine MKII, and the excitement should reach its climax, just as planned...!)<br>
Goooo! ...Wait, did something just...?<br>
<br>
The firecracker hit one of the walls in the corridor and bounced back, landing right at Fu Shun's feet.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Oh my gooooosh! Stop, don't explode!<br>
<br>
BWHOOOOOOOM!<br>
The lights came back on at the same time as the firecracker went off.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Agh... How could I fail at the very, very end... This sucks...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tai Yuan：</span><br>
F-Fu Shun?! Are you hurt?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">An Shan：</span><br>
*Cough, cough*... Not again, Fu Shun! You'd better be prepared for your punishment after trying to do something this stupid! ...Wait, huh?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chang Chun：</span><br>
She's covered in soot...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
Despite the failure... that was still a really intricate practical joke she came up with. Hahah.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lexington：</span><br>
Oh dear, you've been very naughty, Fu Shun. But it was still surprisingly good entertainment.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Whoa, that was scary... I had no idea how that'd go... Uh, what's everyone looking at? Is there something on my face?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ayanami：</span><br>
...Yes, you should look in the mirror.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Aha, ahahaha... I'm a mess...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">An Shan：</span><br>
Geesh... Go to the washroom and clean your face already!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Belfast：</span><br>
This is a rather amusing turn of events, ahaha~<br>
