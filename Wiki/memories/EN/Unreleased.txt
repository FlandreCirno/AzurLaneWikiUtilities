Today, we will discuss what has been dubbed the "meta phenomenon."<br>
"Meta" itself is derived from an ancient word which means "change." <br>
It is quite broad in meaning, but for our purposes, it refers to the result of a property having undergone change.<br>
The process itself of a property changing is what is known as "metamorphosis."<br>
This process has been observed in Wisdom Cubes. These Wisdom Cubes make up the processing centers of our autonomous naval combat platforms... colloquially known as "shipgirls."<br>
Cases of metamorphosis has been observed in certain shipgirl subjects as well. When their cores undergo metamorphosis, it affects their quantum data on a fundamental level.<br>
Once a subject's Wisdom Cube has undergone metamorphosis, it cannot be reversed. At least, not through any means currently known to us.<br>
The conditions that cause metamorphosis lie dormant in all shipgirls. Furthermore, its onset metamorphosis can be manipulated, to a certain degree.<br>
If metamorphosis is allowed to progress unimpeded, a subject's Wisdom Cubes will ultimately turn into an Origin Cube.<br>
It is theorized that if are able to induce late-stage metamorphosis in a subject, they–<br>
