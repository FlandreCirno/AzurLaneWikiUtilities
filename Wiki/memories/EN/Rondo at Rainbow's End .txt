Northern Parliament Control Center - Commanding Vessel<br>
Only a few days have passed since I returned from the Star of Seas… but I am still reeling from what I experienced there over those short few hours.<br>
How is it possible for a plan of that scope to be kept secret for so long…<br>
Supposedly, the plan itself was set in motion before the war even began…<br>
How many people in the Eagle Union or even the entire Azur Lane know about it?<br>
And among those people, how many are able to see past the facade of mystique and actually grasp its profound implications?<br>
Secrets within secrets, plans within plans.<br>
If anything, it lends credence to the Ashes' suspicions.<br>
Many of the technological leaps made recently were actually tied to the servicing of the Star of Seas project.<br>
The Sirens would not provide anything to us that they do not want us to reverse engineer.<br>
And directly researching Siren technology is too dangerous, as the possibility of it leading to dependence cannot be ignored.<br>
But looking at it from another angle…<br>
This is a completely different path that does not violate the principles of the Azur Lane. It avoids the pitfalls that ensnared the Iron Blood, and is also different from the Northern Parliament's path.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Georgia：</span><br>
Ahem… Commander, are you listening?<br>
<br>
"Oh…"<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："Yeah, I'm listening."</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2："Sorry, my mind wandered off for a bit."</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Georgia：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Oh? Then, would you care to share your take on the current situation, Commander?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''"Sorry… My mind actually wandered off for a bit."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Georgia：</span><br>
*sigh*…<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Eldridge：</span><br>
Commander, if you're sleepy, then you should sleep.<br>
Eldridge… will fetch a pillow.<br>
<br>
"Thanks, but I'm good. It's probably better not to promote sleeping on the job…"<br>
"Would you mind repeating what you were just talking about, Georgia?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Georgia：</span><br>
Sure.<br>
As you can see, we're still in the process of assembling all the fleets participating in this operation.<br>
<br>
Georgia begins her explanation of the current situation by directing my attention to a map posted on the wall.<br>
Apparently, it had been updated several times during the duration I was thinking about other things…<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Georgia：</span><br>
This is where our flagship fleet is located, and we will be working closely with the two Eagle Union strike teams to our flanks. Further back in the rear is the reserve fleet.<br>
These fleets will form the core of the Eagle Union's Task Force during this operation.<br>
In addition, New Jersey will be leading an additional NA Ocean strike team to the staging area.<br>
We are expected to meet up there with the two combined Northern Parliament fleets led by Sovetskaya Rossiya.<br>
<br>
"The Northern Parliament fleets look a lot bigger than expected… What about holding down the Polar front?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Georgia：</span><br>
According to them, there shouldn't be an issue as long as this theater doesn't turn into a war of attrition.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："What's the situation with the Royal Navy?"</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2："Has the Sakura Empire made any moves?"</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项3："Any developments with Iris Libre?"</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项4："What about the Vichya Dominion?"</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项5："Update me on the Sardegnian Fleet."</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项6："And finally, can we expect anything from the Dragon Empery?"</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Georgia：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''According to our prior agreement, the bulk of the Royal Navy's forces has taken over the New Jersey fleet's responsibilities to clean up and defend the NA Ocean from Siren stragglers.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''The lack of new information leads me to assume that everything has been going smoothly on their end.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''But in other words, we shouldn't expect much assistance from the Royal Navy during this operation.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Georgia：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''According to our intel, the Sakura Fleet expedition fleet is still moored at Dakar and has not shown any signs of mobilization.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''However, the most predictable part about Akagi is how unpredictable she is, so we can't write off the possibility of their interference.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Georgia：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项3）</span>'''''So far, the Iris Libre fleet seems to be split up between operations in Africa and assisting the Royal Navy.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项3）</span>'''''Unfortunately, what Richelieu said earlier seems to still be true - that Iris Libre has no extra forces to spare.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Georgia：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项4）</span>'''''We have no information on Jean Bart, the flagship of the Vichya Empire, or her current whereabouts.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项4）</span>'''''But, we do have some existing information that they are fortifying their position at Toulon for self-defense and are unlikely to venture out.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项4）</span>'''''I suspect it would be difficult for them to leave the Mediterranée anyway, with the activities of the Royal Navy and Iris Libre.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Georgia：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项5）</span>'''''From what we know, their forces are scattered across several major ports.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项5）</span>'''''After the attack on Rome, Sardegna has adopted strict defensive measures.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项5）</span>'''''The same thing I said before also holds true for Sardegna - with the Royal Navy and Iris Libre's movements, they are unlikely to leave the Mediterranée.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Georgia：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项6）</span>'''''The who…?<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项6）</span>'''''Commander, they aren't deploying any forces for this operation.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Georgia：</span><br>
As for the Iron Blood, we've already been monitoring their large-scale movements.<br>
The signals alone would suggest that their fleet is several times more numerous than what we had intel on.<br>
That basically confirms that the Iron Blood have already deployed signal interference, like they did against the Royal Navy.<br>
We are in the process of performing aerial recon to do a visual confirmation of their actual numbers.<br>
<br>
"The same trick won't work twice."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Georgia：</span><br>
Finally, we still don't know where their current flagship, Friedrich der Große, is located. I'll contact you as soon as we get an update.<br>
<br>
"Thanks. So, how does it feel being out on the battlefield for the first time, Georgia?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Georgia：</span><br>
Uhh… Well, how do I put it… I was expecting to be on the front lines, doing something a bit more… glorious? Never expected I'd end up as the command ship and combat secretary.<br>
So, a bit different from what I was expecting. But not a big deal at the end of the day.<br>
<br>
"What's your overall view of the current situation?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Georgia：</span><br>
Judging by the numbers, we have a significant advantage in the head-on-head.<br>
But because this is a joint operation organized by different factions and fleets, it may be difficult to keep everyone on the same page.<br>
And to me, the Iron Blood always seems to have this capricious, unpredictable element to them… Until the dust settles, we don't know what tricks they'll have up their sleeve.<br>
<br>
"Good. You know what they say - never underestimate the enemy. Let's proceed with caution and stick to the plan."<br>
"Rest assured, you'll have plenty of opportunities to demonstrate your power on the battlefield."<br>
"Also, one last thing––"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Georgia：</span><br>
Got another question for me, Commander?<br>
<br>
As you can see, we're still in the process of assembling all the fleets participating in this operation.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Georgia：</span><br>
Uhh, about Eldridge, she's…<br>
<br>
After a lot of searching, we found Eldridge asleep on the floor not far from the ship's hatch.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Eldridge：</span><br>
Zzzz…<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Georgia：</span><br>
The most logical conclusion is that Eldridge fell asleep hugging the pillow because it was too comfortable.<br>
Hmm… Commander, you still look pretty worn-out yourself.<br>
You'll need a lot of focus once the operation starts, so why not rest up before then?<br>
<br>
Just watching Eldridge's peaceful slumber filled me with drowsiness as well.<br>
"I think I'll take you up on that bit of advice…"<br>
Scapa Flow, an important Royal Navy base, was taken by the Iron Blood in a surprise attack.<br>
And though this event would seem like a boiling point in the two factions' relationship...<br>
The attack was instead followed by an unexpected period of tranquility.<br>
But what undercurrents flow beneath the tenuous peace? <br>
A ploy engineered by the Iron Blood? A cunning rebuttal by the Royal Navy?<br>
Or perhaps, a greater truth that Towers above petty conflicts?<br>
In the calm before the curtains rise, the shifting of pieces can be heard within the silence.<br>
Preparations for battle, the humming of a Singularity, and the intersection of fates.<br>
Listen well to the rondo that is about to be played––<br>
For true peace... can perhaps only be found at the rainbow's end.<br>

<br>
NA Ocean - Southeast Sector E<br>
A Sakura Empire fleet advanced cautiously under the cover of night.<br>
Though the Azur Lane cleared the NA Ocean of Siren forces, these waters have only become more dangerous for the Sakura Empire.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jintsuu：</span><br>
No abnormalities detected underwater. At least it doesn't seem like any submarines are tailing us.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
My recons haven't run into any enemies either, so the route ahead of us should be safe as well!<br>
But having said that, now that the ceasefire agreement's been turned into scrap paper, these waters can turn into a battlefield at any moment...<br>
...There is one thing I don't understand though, Akagi.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Why I decided to bring you along to this operation?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
I have my own suspicions already... but it all boils down to Friedrich der Große, doesn't it?<br>
The Iron Blood is at a massive numbers disadvantage when compared to the entire Azur Lane, but Friedrich's deployments seem... awfully unconcerned.<br>
A lot of their forces are still being kept at the Floating Fortress, and even the fleet stationed at Dakar hasn't moved out either.<br>
Despite all of this, she invited us to meet her at the Scapa Flow anchorage of all places.<br>
It's as if the fire has come to the front door but she's still moving things around in the back of the house...<br>
What exactly is she planning...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kaga：</span><br>
I find myself in agreement with Zuikaku this time. Sister, there's something strange about Friedrich's invitation.<br>
Scapa Flow is quite close to the Royal Navy's homeland. The Iron Blood has basically put themselves in an indefensible position.<br>
Their deployment decisions are completely contrary to reason.<br>
Even though she did say she was going to "show us something interesting," how do we know that we're not being dragged in to serve as her meatshields?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
It's a possibility.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Akagi... If we're really going on such a risky mission, we should've brought more escorts, right?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
What good would that serve?<br>
The larger the fleet, the easier it is for our cover to be blown.<br>
Secondly, the more numbers we bring, the more tantalizing it would be for Friedrich to use us as meatshields.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Even if you feel wronged, I don't think we should be playing with our lives here...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
I have much more knowledge of this area's intel than you, so don't worry about troop deployments.<br>
Friedrich der Große has always operated from the shadows, and I'm not keen on the way she acts like a high-and-mighty puppetmaster.<br>
But, I do know that she wouldn't lie.<br>
In the invitation was the mention of showing us another "possibility." That alone is enough.<br>
That is the true purpose why we've journeyed thousands of miles from the Sakura Islands.<br>
Since we were not able to enter the heart of the NA Ocean, we must not miss this opportunity, no matter what.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
What does "another possibility" even mean...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
You'll understand when you see it.<br>
You wanted to know why I brought you along.<br>
I'll admit, a part of it is just me acting on a whim.<br>
But more importantly, you want to know too, don't you?<br>
I'm aware that the new Combined Fleet has been keeping an eye on me, and that many of you disagree with my decisions.<br>
But there's one thing you've failed to consider – we aren't looking at the same reality.<br>
Given what I've seen, I would make the same decisions, again and again.<br>
But what about your beliefs?<br>
When you've seen my reality, would you still be able to hold your same beliefs?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
My beliefs aren't that easy to shake...!<br>
But... I do hope to be able to understand your point of view a bit better.<br>
That way, I can truly convince you to choose another path!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Then, we shall wait and see.<br>
What kind of performance will the Iron Blood put on for us this time? Ahahaha...<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=The Royal Anchorage|选项=3|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=否}}
<br>
Just on the horizon, the first vestiges of the anchorage became visible to the Sakura fleet.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Akagi, we're about to arrive at Scapa Flow!<br>
It seems like the Royal Navy hasn't even mobilized any forces in this area yet, let alone launched a counterattack.<br>
Does that mean they were caught off-guard by a surprise attack?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kaga：</span><br>
Perhaps... But look closely, Zuikaku.<br>
There aren't any signs of fighting here, and it doesn't seem like the Iron Blood has taken the facilities for their own use either.<br>
Did they drive out the Royal Navy and then leave things alone... or was the Iron Blood never interested in occupying Scapa Flow in the first place?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jintsuu：</span><br>
Isn't the Scapa Flow anchorage critical to the defense of the Royal Navy's homeland? It wouldn't make any sense for them to just give it up without a fight.<br>
It's possible that the Iron Blood needed this area to conduct some sort of experiment, but that still doesn't explain the absence of Royal Navy ships.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Hard to say. Just be glad we don't have to fight our way to the spectator seats.<br>
Let's go. I'm sure Friedrich will soon provide answers to our questions.<br>
<br>
Scapa Flow Anchorage<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Wow... Even though this place is enclosed by islands, there are so many waterways leading out...<br>
Seeing this in person really makes you appreciate how powerful Mother Nature can be.<br>
Akagi, what's that ship over there?<br>
It looks mass-produced, but a really old-fashioned model.<br>
<br>
As the fleet entered the harbor, the shadow of a large moored warship loomed in front of them.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
This is... a Queen Elizabeth-class?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
It doesn't look anything like the mass-produced ships we've seen before though...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Because it's not. This is a warship that predates the mass-produced "ships" of our era.<br>
We are "ships" born from Wisdom Cubes, but these vessels are constructs assembled from steel, protecting the seas long before our time.<br>
Before the advent of Wisdom Cubes, humanity built these vessels, and they became the blade they wielded.<br>
Nowadays, you'll only find transport ships and rare models of mass-produced ships made the old-fashioned way.<br>
Unlike modern mass-production which can churn out a large number of ships in a short amount of time, each one of these warships had unique designs and a long construction process.<br>
That is why when we, the shipgirls, appeared, these older vessels were quickly phased out of production.<br>
Even the mass-produced ships are little more than mementos of a bygone era, reserve forces that assist us in our operations.<br>
But some things are for the best. The era when these warships were the only line of defense against the Sirens was a tragic one.<br>
(Rather than being scrapped like so many others, at least you were able to spend the rest of your lives in the relative peace of this harbor...)<br>
(I wonder what would've happened to our "past forms"...)<br>
(...If they could have been preserved into an era of peace...)<br>
But judging by this warship's presence here, it seems that even the Iron Blood cannot touch the past.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
I wonder if we have any warships like this back in the Sakura Empire...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Who knows? It's something I stopped caring about long ago.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jintsuu：</span><br>
Akagi, an Iron Blood ship is coming our way.<br>
<br>
Several Iron Blood ships were moored along the coast of the harbor.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ägir：</span><br>
Heheh. You've come, Akagi of the Sakura Empire.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">August von Parseval：</span><br>
Good day, esteemed guests. You've been personally invited by Friedrich der Große.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
(Ägir and August von Parseval... the Iron Blood's latest blueprint ships...)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ägir：</span><br>
I can see the curiosity in your eyes, but let's save that for later.<br>
<br>
Guided by the Iron Blood ships, Akagi and her fleet made their way deeper into the harbor.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">August von Parseval：</span><br>
Right this way. Friedrich has been waiting for you.<br>

<br>
Scapa Flow Anchorage<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
It is a pleasure to see you again, my allies from the Sakura Empire.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Certainly, it feels like an eternity has passed since our banquet in Sardegna.<br>
Though the curtains have yet to rise, I am quite impressed at this... stage that you've set.<br>
How were you able to take Scapa Flow without a fight?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
A "performance" like this is best enjoyed by a select few, without the interruption of a boorish audience. Let's just say I employed a few little tricks.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
...Are you not worried about the Azur Lane bringing down the entire theater?<br>
I heard their staging area includes this area as well. It would be a pity if they barged in on your performance.<br>
You face the combined might of the Azur Lane, and also stand against the Commander.<br>
The jamming can buy you some time, but they will see through those tricks soon enough.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
You're right... Indeed, my fleet alone is unable to defeat the Azur Lane.<br>
If I was to call upon the Sakura Empire's aid, would you join us...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Hehehe... I'm glad you acknowledge the capability of the Sakura Empire...<br>
But I must decline your offer. We did not come here to take part in your play.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
Of course. And at no point did I expect you to agree.<br>
<br>
And just like you, I have no intention of participating in this play either.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
Incidentally, are you familiar with the incident that took place here at Scapa Flow?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
If I remember correctly, that was the Siren attack on Scapa Flow during the last great war, right?<br>
The Sirens ambushed the Iron Blood fleet, and the Azur Lane's leadership made the decision to not assist them...<br>
The Iron Blood fleet that fled into the harbor was completely annihilated... and that incident became one of the chief factors that led to the Iron Blood withdrawing from the Azur Lane.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
Yes, a fairly standard answer. That's what everyone has agreed on.<br>
Don't you think something doesn't quite add up though? Even though the Sirens were already the common enemy of humanity at that point, why would the Iron Blood main fleet flee into a Royal Navy harbor?<br>
In other words, if the Royal Navy took in the Iron Blood, then why is it that only the Iron Blood fleet got wiped out?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
..........<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
I've heard another account of the events, but I'm not sure how reliable it is.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
Let's hear it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
That there was actually no surprise attack – but rather, something went wrong when the Iron Blood was trying to capture Sirens for their own purposes.<br>
The Royal Navy was also caught in the crossfire, and Scapa Flow's facilities also suffered severe damage as a result.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
So you're saying, the Iron Blood invited the Sirens into the harbor...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Who knows what the truth really is? Maybe Friedrich has some insight. After all, we weren't invited here simply to chat, correct?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
It is said that history is written by the victors. But to write is to compose a narrative.<br>
But we are not writers – we are warriors. What is a record in comparison to the scars of war?<br>
For us, the truth of this battle is––<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">???：</span><br>
Enough of your senseless bloviating, Friedrich!<br>
We could have hired a jester if we wanted to listen to someone talk in circles all day!<br>
<br>
A small girl suddenly burst into the room in the middle of Friedrich's monologue.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kaga：</span><br>
Queen Elizabeth...?!<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
That's right! You are in the presence of the Queen!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
What an impetuous child. Hehe.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Wait, this isn't making any sense to me... Why is the leader of the Royal Navy here?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
My, it seems like you got your hands on much more than just an antiquated warship.<br>
I see, so this is the secret behind the Iron Blood's little "transaction." Control of Scapa Flow, in exchange for the little queen's safety.<br>
Color me surprised by the extraordinary lengths to which you'd go, Friedrich. You'd even hold one of the major faction's leaders hostage.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
As if! If anything, it's the other way around! Friedrich is currently under the supervision of the Royal Navy!<br>
Besides, if I was the hostage here, I wouldn't be moving around freely.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
Indeed... What kind of hostage would have the luxury to barge in during the kidnapper's speech?<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Good grief, just how much do you love listening to yourself talk?<br>
Belfast and the others are almost done with their preparation. The Singularity is getting hard to maintain, so I'll need to have them head over soon.<br>
You wish to know what really happened at Scapa Flow? Then I shall show you the truth!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
Very well. The Azur Lane is making progress faster than expected, so we must make haste.<br>
I look forward to hearing the piece you will play for us, little queen.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Hmph. And hear it you shall!<br>
<br>
Queen Elizabeth pulled out a communicator and pressed the button, issuing her instructions to the recipients on the other end.<br>
In that moment, the still waters of Scapa Flow suddenly became turbulent and the surface of the sea began to cave in.<br>
From the crevice rose an empty sun, a gateway pulsating with otherworldly energy.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
Allow me to welcome you once more, esteemed guests from the Sakura Empire.<br>
Harken to the coming of the final movement!<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=Singularity|选项=5|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=否}}
<br>
Under the instructions of Queen Elizabeth, a new Singularity rose above the waters of Scapa Flow.<br>
A steady stream of energy seeped from the ring of light surrounding the gate, evaporating the surrounding seawater into a fine mist.<br>
In contrast to its intimidating form, a rainbow glistened within the shining mist, like a road stretching beyond the gateway.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
My... This is rather unexpected...<br>
Is this based on the Iron Blood's Singularity research? No... this is much more advanced than anything I've seen before...<br>
Judging by the looks on the little queen's face, the Royal Navy seems to have played a part in this.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
I'll leave it to your imagination. What I will say is, none of this conflicts with my child's wishes.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
I see... I'll also assume that you didn't put on this show just to ask us to close the Singularity.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
Correct. Beyond the Singularity lies the truth of what happened at Scapa Flow, as well as the answers you seek.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Wait, hold on, this is a bit much to take in all at once... What's the deal with this Singularity, and are you saying we have to go THROUGH it?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
It is another branch, a world parallel to ours.<br>
But this gateway does not lead directly to another world, but rather a Mirror Sea of sorts that projects the records of the Natural Calculation System.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kaga：</span><br>
So if I'm understanding this correctly, it's different from the realm where you retrieved those META ships?<br>
The only information we have comes from the reports you've given us. How do we know that it's safe to pass through this Singularity?<br>
What proof can you offer that beyond this door lies the things that you promised?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
...I want to see the truth, Kaga.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kaga：</span><br>
Then I shall remain here until you return.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Suit yourself, Kaga.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
Ägir and August von Parseval will remain behind as well then. If the Azur Lane comes, you know what to do.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">August von Parseval：</span><br>
Understood...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ägir：</span><br>
Hehe. Don't underestimate me, Friedrich der Große. Just who do you think I am?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Jintsuu, contact Yamashiro's group. Provide them the instructions on how to get here.<br>
...Will you be coming with us as well, little queen?<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Of course! And stop it with the little, and the queen! Just Elizabeth will do!<br>
We've already done some preliminary scouting, so follow my lead!<br>
<br>
With those words, Queen Elizabeth was the first to disappear through the gate.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Man, I'm still not so sure about this...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
It's fine. She may seem moody and fickle at times, but she is the leader of the Royal Navy for a reason.<br>
The fact that she went in first should be solid enough proof that it's safe.<br>
We can trust her for now. Zuikaku, await my instructions once you're inside.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Got it, Akagi.<br>
<br>
Akagi and Zuikaku disappeared into the Singularity as well, with Friedrich der Große following right behind them.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
At long last, our rondo finally begins.<br>

<br>
NA Ocean - East Continental Shelf Sector C<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">August von Parseval：</span><br>
Ulrich, the Singularity has been opened.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
Understood. All preparations done on my end as well.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
If the Singularity is up and running, that means it's time to ramp up the EM interference.<br>
Let's get to know each other better with a little dance, Azur Lane~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
I'll lead the charge, then. Hopefully you'll be able to sow chaos in the enemy's ranks, the one thing you're good for.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Aww, how mean of you, Ulrich. Look, our dance has already started~<br>
<br>
The panels of Ulrich's electronic equipment suddenly erupted with countless "ally" symbols.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
Hmph, not bad... Seems like you're capable of getting serious after all.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
You flatter me~ This only works because our destroyers scattered throughout the area have relay devices equipped onto them.<br>
They'll see that we outnumber them three-to-one on the radar now. It'll be quite a headache to figure out what's real and what isn't~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
Unfortunately, we can't take a head-on engagement against a fleet of that size––<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
But luckily, we don't have to. The important thing is that we buy time – and as long as we can force them to advance cautiously, we can avoid a direct confrontation.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
No, things won't be that simple.<br>
After all, there's something you're dying to try, right? For example, fighting against the Commander...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
...If you're going to put the words in my mouth, then... Yeah, that's something I'd like to try at least once~<br>
I'll be passing on-site command to you, Ulrich, so you can do whatever you want with the fleet.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
Hmph. Very well. You'll have an easier time making your move as well.<br>
(Farce or not, opportunities to spar against the Commander don't come often.)<br>
(I'll have to plan every move carefully... Tch, what a pain.)<br>
Adalbert, Roon, U-81, change in plans. Intercept the Eagle Union fleet.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U81：</span><br>
Sure thing! I was hoping I'd get to play tag with them a bit more, but that's fine.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Adalbert：</span><br>
All righty, heard you loud and clear~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Roon：</span><br>
Ahh, how refreshing it is to get to fight again~<br>
Mainz and I will be waiting for the Commander here. When are you coming, Ulrich?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
Soon enough. Don't engage until I arrive.<br>
(If we can pin down the Commander's flagship, the Azur Lane will also have to change their plans. Two birds with one stone.)<br>
I'll make full use of this opportunity!<br>

<br>
Inside the Singularity...<br>
The other side of the gateway appeared to be the same place that the group had just come from, except...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
This is... also Scapa Flow? But look at all the destruction here...<br>
How terrible... An entire fleet reduced to burning scrap metal, just like the reports said...<br>
<br>
Friedrich had described this place as a projection of Siren records, but the palpable destruction in the air leaves the onlookers in shock.<br>
According to the preliminary investigations that were conducted, the events recorded here directly followed the destruction of the Iron Blood fleet by the Sirens at Scapa Flow.<br>
Yet no Sirens are present at the scene, as if they had either all withdrawn, or were simply omitted from the recording.<br>
The only things that remain are smoke, flames, and the slowly sinking debris of destroyed warships.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Look at all the old-fashioned warships here... They're simply no match for the Sirens.<br>
The port's facilities look like they've been ripped apart as well. Does the Royal Navy have any records of such extensive damage being done?<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
None. But as we can clearly see, the anchorage was rebuilt following the incident at some point.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
I see. This is quite literally a Reenactment of the events from back then.<br>
But you didn't actually take us into the past.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
What you see here indeed transpired in the past, but we did not rip open the fabric of time.<br>
It is not necessarily our past, but rather one of many possibilities.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
...That doesn't tell me anything. The contents here could've been tampered with in a number of ways.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
Indeed, but the destruction that you see here is, in fact, a reality.<br>
This is a Siren experimental site, a Reenactment of a battle that took place in our world.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
I can't believe how many Iron Blood ships were lost here...<br>
So, the thing about Azur Lane not helping was true after all...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
Isn't there someone here better suited to answer that question?<br>
Even though we were not firsthand witnesses to this incident, there should still be direct accounts of what happened.<br>
It is about time we hear the other side of the story.<br>
Since we invited them all the way here, why don't we share the truth with our guests here?<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
...Hmph.<br>
<br>
Queen Elizabeth hesitates for a while, but eventually lets out a sigh of resignation.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
How could the Azur Lane betray them like that?!<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
...Betray? After seeing all this destruction in front of you, do you still believe something like that happened?<br>
First of all, Scapa Flow belongs to the Royal Navy.<br>
Have you ever considered how grave the consequences of losing Scapa Flow would be to the Royal Islands?<br>
What good would selling out the Iron Blood do if it resulted in us losing our very homeland?<br>
Additionally, the Iron Blood aren't the only ones who suffered terrible losses that day!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Wow, you're right... There are shipwrecks with Royal Navy insignias as well...<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Not just a few of them, either. I'm sure you'll find more if you fly your airplanes around.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Ugh... Then...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
The Iron Blood tried to carry out a Siren capture operation, which ended up failing and angering the Sirens.<br>
They fled for their lives to Scapa Flow, leading the Sirens right to it... resulting in the destruction of Scapa Flow and both of the fleets there.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Naturally, this account originated from the Royal Navy's upper echelons. Take that information with a grain of salt.<br>
Having that said... It should be clear that the Royal Navy fought alongside the Iron Blood here – and shared the same fate.<br>
However, any trace of that happening was erased... along with what happened to our ships as well as Scapa Flow itself.<br>
The question on everyone's mind at this point probably is, how could destruction of this scale avoid the public eye?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
...They wanted to stamp out any evidence that the Royal Navy worked together with the Iron Blood.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
That may well be the case. There is still much we don't know about this Singularity – and what occurred here.<br>
What we see here at best can be understood to be the Sirens' point of view. The only ones who can truly tell us what happened... are the ones who were actually here at the time.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
...Judging by the looks of things, there weren't any survivors.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
That is why I decided to cooperate with the Iron Blood – so that the people who were here can reveal the truth to us.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
Yes... Can you hear their whispers upon these waters?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:96}：</span><br>
What are you talking about? I don't get it...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
Do you feel the resentment of their shattered forms?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:91}：</span><br>
.........<br>
Stand behind me, Zuikaku. Something's about to happen.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:96}：</span><br>
Y-yes!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
Even in this place, I can see the shape of the history written around them.<br>
Their glory, their shame. Their achievements, their oblivion. The flames burning across the sea are an ode from the past.<br>
Their joy, their sorrow. Their melancholy, their anger. Each sound that echoes through this hollow sky gives form to their suffering.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
.........<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
The truth is inviolably carved into this space. And thus, their emotions yet linger as well.<br>
<br>
A number of Wisdom Cubes began to spin around Friedrich der Große as she walked to the middle of the Singularity's waters.<br>
As they spun faster and faster, a dazzling halo of blue light rippled outwards to quash the ominous red of the burning sea.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
May your minds be etched. May history give you form. May your hulls inherit your essence.<br>
May your new bodies become the Arks to bear our history forward––<br>
A ship that is neither a ship, a human that is neither a human – become the blade that shall strike down our foes.<br>
...Open your eyes to the light of creation, my friends!<br>
<br>
The surrounding waters became turbulent from the blinding oscillation of the Cubes, kicking up waves that knock on the shattered coffins of ruined warships.<br>
The light shone brighter and brighter, blue turning into an incandescent gold, so bright that the onlookers had to shield their eyes.<br>
But from between the gaps in their fingers, they witnessed a sight they would be able to forget––<br>
The overflowing light from the Cubes began to dissipate, and the Cubes soon followed suit as if dissolving into the sky.<br>
From the silence that once again fell over the ruined battlefield, the sound of soft breathing could be heard.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">????：</span><br>
..........<br>
<br>
The ever-so-faint sound shook Akagi to her core. Not just her – but everyone else there – knew what had just happened.<br>
The ordering of disorder into order. The humming of the soul, given form from the earth. The authority of the divine, held within mortal hands.<br>
Without a doubt, they had witnessed...<br>
The birth of a shipgirl.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Seydlitz：</span><br>
..........<br>
.......Where... am I?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
.........<br>
Welcome to our world, battlecruiser Seydlitz.<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=Rebirth|选项=8|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=否}}
<br>
The light continued to pulse several more times until finally, Friedrich lowered her arms.<br>
The newly born shipgirls began to gather around her.<br>
Each had a different expression on her face – astonishment, relief, curiosity, vexation.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Seydlitz：</span><br>
I am Seydlitz, Iron Blood battlecruiser. It is good to see you again, Friedrich der Große.<br>
I remember the last time we fought together... Wait, scratch all that, I seem to have the wrong person...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
No worries. All rivers flow to the same ocean, my friend.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Seydlitz：</span><br>
I... see? Well, in any case, I still need to get used to this new body and equipment, but I'm always ready to fight.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yorck：</span><br>
My, I never expected to experience something like this. Hehehe...<br>
So, whose orders will I be following now?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lützow：</span><br>
*yawwwwn*... What the hell, I was just starting to enjoy my nap.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Seydlitz：</span><br>
Lützow, I don't think this is any time to be napping.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lützow：</span><br>
Got a problem with me saying what's on my mind? Is it controversial to say that it's better to wake up naturally than to be woken up?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yorck：</span><br>
Would you prefer to go back to eternal sleep within a sea of flames and wrecked warships?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lützow：</span><br>
Nah, I'm over that.<br>
Well, I feel way more flexible in this body, and I'm pretty cute too. So I'll forgive you for waking me up.<br>
Anyway, I'm the Iron Blood battlecruiser Lützow. If you don't need me for anything else, I'm going back to sleep~ <br>
Ah, nice, my rigging makes for a nice makeshift bed. Peace out, and don't call me if you need me~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
Hehe. Do enjoy yourself.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Thüringen：</span><br>
Friedrich, are we the only ones?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
Unfortunately, yes.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Thüringen：</span><br>
...My friends...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
It's no good. I don't know the exact reason why, but it doesn't seem like any new ships can emerge from this place.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Thüringen：</span><br>
I see. Perhaps this, too, is fate.<br>
I, battleship Thüringen, vow to fight once more for the Iron Blood, no matter what form I take.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Elbing：</span><br>
I-I'm Elbing, Iron Blood light cruiser... Umm, I'm not sure why this opportunity was wasted on me... but I'm fine with being used as a decoy or a meatshield...<br>
I already know I'm going to let everyone down... Even if I try my best, I'm just going to fail anyway... *sigh*...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
I never expected something like this to be possible, Elizabeth.<br>
Did you feign being caught off guard by the Iron Blood to avoid the suspicions of the Naval HQ?<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
I'm not going to answer that question.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
I expected as much. So, what now? Are you going to do that too?<br>
If Friedrich can pull it off, there shouldn't be anything stopping you––<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Unfortunately, that's not how it works. This place was designed as an Iron Blood experimentation site.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
(Interesting. There's more to this technology than meets the eye – and more restrictions that I'm not aware of.)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yorck：</span><br>
E-Emden, are you alright? You haven't said anything this whole time...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Emden：</span><br>
Yes, I'm fine.<br>
"Emden has no need for your concern. She is not so weak. We are not so weak."<br>
I am Emden, the Swan of the East. I await your orders.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
The Swan of the East? You must be the Dresden-class Emden then...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Emden：</span><br>
"And I am the Emden of the Königsberg-class. I met my fate here as a warship."<br>
Yes, I heard your call, and when I followed the light, I was brought here.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
It seems that your fates were intertwined when you were called here.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Emden：</span><br>
I cannot say for sure.<br>
"Perhaps her strong desire to seek out beauty imprinted her fate to this hull." <br>
But now, we are here. Therefore, we exist.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
Indeed. This is not quite what I expected when I called out to Emden.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Emden：</span><br>
"You would wield these powers on a whim, without fully understanding what they are capable of?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
On a whim? Perhaps. There is more that my child has yet to tell me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Emden：</span><br>
"So, what would you have us do?"<br>
Shall we hunt the Sirens once more?<br>
"Did you miss us that badly?"<br>
Or... did you wish to make up for past regrets?<br>
"Though, I care little for your motivations. The others seem to have accepted our new reality already."<br>
But you... You're both familiar, yet so very different. What exactly are you?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
I'm not the Friedrich der Große that you know, but does it matter?<br>
I have no past – I am but a crystallization of a desire.<br>
But, I am the blueprint ship, Friedrich der Große.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Emden：</span><br>
You're right, it doesn't matter.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
As for your earlier question, there is nothing I ask of you.<br>
This is a Siren experimentation site, and you are newly-born shipgirls. Do I need to elaborate any further?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lützow：</span><br>
Follow our instincts, huh? Sounds good to me. I hate taking orders, after all.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
Did you enjoy your nap?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lützow：</span><br>
Some things are more interesting than sleep. See?<br>
You're not going to introduce me to the other ships over there?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
I will. They are your new allies.<br>
Their names are Akagi and Zuikaku, aircraft carriers from the Sakura Empire.<br>
And over there is Her Majesty, Queen Elizabeth of the Royal Navy.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Thüringen：</span><br>
Strange bedfellows, but it seems that the situation is desperate enough to warrant it.<br>
I suppose this means that the Azur Lane managed to achieve its goal.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lützow：</span><br>
What the heck is an aircraft carrier?<br>
Ugh, and I've never seen any of this equipment before. Gimme a bit to figure all this stuff out.<br>
And hol' up, are you seriously saying that little girl right there is the QUEEN? I thought she was supposed to be bigger and have a bit more... armor around this area?<br>
Ehh? She's even smaller than I thought!<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
You. You're already dead.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lützow：</span><br>
Ahaha... Easy now, I just was expecting a bit more out of a battleship.<br>
See, Thüringen is a proper-sized battleship, right?<br>
But I guess size isn't everything... Elbing and Emden look completely different even though they're both cruisers...<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Bloody hell! If you keep making fun of me I'm going to lop some of that fat off with my main battery!!<br>
You bunch are just as insufferable as that Deutschland!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Thüringen：</span><br>
I apologize for her rudeness, Your Majesty.<br>
We all know that it is not size that determines a battleship's value.<br>
It was uncouth of Lützow to assume that you aren't a battleship simply because you are... lacking in certain areas.<br>
She tends to speak before she thinks at times, so I do hope you harbor enough magnanimity in your bosom to forgive her.<br>
You ought to apologize too, Lützow.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lützow：</span><br>
Why? I was just stating facts, wasn't I?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:96}：</span><br>
C'mon, just do it so we can move on...<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
I am SO done with both of you! I don't need your stupid apologies!!<br>
*sigh*... As I was saying, the Royal Navy will be cooperating with the Iron Blood.<br>
But alliances are not formed so easily overnight.<br>
As shipgirls, it may be easy for us to work together, but our factions are more divided than ever before.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lützow：</span><br>
...Huh?<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Why does that surprise you? Countless things threatened both the formation and the integrity of the Azur Lane even during the last war.<br>
The same is true now – or at least, that's what the Naval HQ seems to want. <br>
Anyway, Friedrich, don't forget the reason why we're here.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
Naturally. Once you're done talking.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Hey, it's not like I wanted to bring this up in the first place, if SOMEONE would stop teasing me about my body!<br>
Remember, the Singularity's gate is being kept open by energy from the outside. We don't have forever.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
Indeed. Now, my friends from the High Sea Fleet... I have a question for all of you–<br>
What exactly happened at Scapa Flow?<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=Memory Lane|选项=9|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=否}}
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lützow：</span><br>
Oh boy. I was half-expecting this question. *yaaawn*...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
Would you mind answering it?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lützow：</span><br>
No can do. We're not the ships that sank back then.<br>
Buuut... Strange as it sounds, I have hazy memories of what happened here, like a distant dream...<br>
Can't tell you whether they're real or not, and even if they are, who's to say my account is accurate?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
Don't worry about that. Whatever you remember is what really happened.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lützow：</span><br>
Really, huh? Then let me warn you: what I do remember is no cozy campfire story.<br>
Not even sure why you're so keen on knowing. I'm not gonna like telling it, and you're not gonna like hearing it.<br>
I've got better things to do with this life, so why not just move on?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
There's no need to lament what could have been, for either of us. We simply want to know the truth behind what happened.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Thüringen：</span><br>
Hmm... It might be hard to explain things to you though.<br>
There were no shipgirls around back then, so we aren't "eyewitnesses" in a literal sense.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
But your connection to this place has left an imprint upon your hulls.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Thüringen：</span><br>
You do have a point. My memories seem not to be from the perspective of a warship, but rather from that of a person.<br>
Almost as if... we had witnessed the event as we are now – as shipgirls.<br>
But as Lützow said, it's all quite hazy.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
A restructuring of cognition... So it wasn't just my imagination...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
There is a dramatic shift from a warship's passive perception to a shipgirl's active cognition. The nature of this process is beyond our current understanding.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lützow：</span><br>
Confused? Yeah, I am too. Don't worry about it.<br>
Look, you don't wanna hear a long-winded explanation, do you? I've got a better, more fun alternative.<br>
We'll just act out what happened. The good ol' show, don't tell.<br>
<br>
Scapa Flow - Surrounding Waters<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Seydlitz：</span><br>
Hits confirmed, Lützow! The Siren fleet is losing speed!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yorck：</span><br>
See? It was worth it to practice your gunnery.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lützow：</span><br>
Great, keep it up. I wanna see at least a hundred Siren wrecks by the time you're done.<br>
*yawn*... Crushing victories always make me sleepy.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Elbing：</span><br>
We're nearing Royal Navy territory... I bet they're going to designate us as hostiles and open fire...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Emden：</span><br>
"That would be a damned declaration of war. The Royal Navy wouldn't dare."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yorck：</span><br>
Don't worry about them. The Sirens are our only target today.<br>
Sure, we're not allied with Azur Lane, but we're all allies in humanity's fight against the Siren menace. The Royal Navy will have to pardon a little trespassing.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Thüringen：</span><br>
Indeed, this isn't the time for petty infighting. Although, we should let them know we're here, just to be safe.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Elbing：</span><br>
That's a good idea. Let's do i– Err, I mean... Terrible idea! Let's not do that!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Thüringen：</span><br>
Thanks for the blessings. Once we get to Scapa Flow, I'll message the Royal Navy about the incoming Sirens, then we resume our attack.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lützow：</span><br>
Sounds like a plan! Fleet, head for Scapa Flow and attack!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Thüringen：</span><br>
The message, Lützow! Don't omit so many crucial details!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
...I'm gonna assume this didn't all stem from someone forgetting to send a message, right?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lützow：</span><br>
Nah. Thüringen did it after we entered the Royal Navy's waters.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
So you DID enter without permission! Being chased by Sirens isn't a valid excuse for breaking international law!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lützow：</span><br>
Relaaax. You're making a mountain out of a molehill.<br>
Besides, this wasn't the first time we'd done it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Not even the first time, huh...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lützow：</span><br>
Yeah, the Royal Navy didn't like it, but what's it matter anyway?<br>
They'd suffered big casualties in one of the Sirens' previous attacks, so they weren't in any position to stop us.<br>
Plus, this was a good chance to salvage Siren tech to end the war sooner. Is that excuse not good enough?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
You're giving me less and less reason to side with you right now.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
So? What happened after that?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lützow：</span><br>
Well, you see... That's when the Royal Navy showed up.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Seydlitz：</span><br>
Multiple Royal Navy ships sighted! Straight to our... Wait, they're using light signals!<br>
They're saying... "Halt immediately and submit to an inspection."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Emden：</span><br>
"An inspection? What do they take us for, merchant vessels? I am insulted."<br>
Ignore their message. They haven't the forces to even try to stop us.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Seydlitz：</span><br>
But Emden, almost their entire defense fleet is advancing towards us!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Emden：</span><br>
"Their 'entire fleet'? You're talking about a handful of ships. We outnumber them."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Seydlitz：</span><br>
While, yes, our numbers are superior, their force consists of battleships and battlecruisers!<br>
Should a firefight break out, we are highly likely to suffer casualties.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Elbing：</span><br>
Yeah... Some of us will end up on the pile of wrecks we're supposed to capture...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Emden：</span><br>
"Like hell we will. Damn the Royal Navy... What is with them?"<br>
"Fine, we'll play nice. Patch them through."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lützow：</span><br>
Seydlitz, tell 'em we'll come to a stop.<br>
Oh, but also tell them we're not submitting to a patdown.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Warspite：</span><br>
"Iron Blood! You're, like, totally not supposed to be in Royal Navy waters. Get outta here!"<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Valiant：</span><br>
"You were smart enough to stop, so we'll be nice and not open fire on your bratwursty butts!"<br>
"Turn around and leave, lassies! Be on your way now and we'll overlook this little whoopsie-daisy!"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Are those exact quotes, or...?<br>
Doesn't sound like the Warspite and Valiant I know.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:96}：</span><br>
For reference, Warspite looks like this.<br>
And Valiant like this.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lützow：</span><br>
Really, huh? I'm seeing a pattern here – all Royal Navy battleships are flat as boards.<br>
Must run in the family, seeing as they're all dwarves too.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
That is blatantly untrue, hussy!<br>
Drop this digression at once and get back on topic!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lützow：</span><br>
Guess I struck a nerve, huh? Fine, Your Majesty.<br>
Actually, this would be easier to just explain than to show.<br>
Basically, we stayed right where we were. After all, what reason did we have to leave?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Other than, I dunno, the whole TRESPASSING thing? None, I guess.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lützow：</span><br>
Back then, I guess we thought they'd break off if we just stood our ground.<br>
But as fate would have it, they didn't. They stood their ground too.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Keep treading thin ice and it's eventually gonna collapse beneath you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lützow：</span><br>
Hmm. Maybe we were pushing our luck after all. Maybe.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Hold on a minute. Weren't Sirens pursuing you? What became of them?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lützow：</span><br>
Well, we got in formation again and fired at them. What else?<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
WHILE the Royal Navy had its guns trained on you?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lützow：</span><br>
Exactamundo. It was as simple as that. *yawn*...<br>
Man, explaining all this is so tiring and boring...<br>
Elbing, Seydlitz, take it from here. Peace ooouut– Zzz...<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Did she just fall asleep mid-sentence?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Seydlitz：</span><br>
I sincerely apologize for her discourtesy, Your Majesty! Allow me to continue where she left off!<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Seydlitz：</span><br>
Because of the approaching Sirens, we promptly petitioned a ceasefire agreement to the Royal Navy fleet.<br>
They swiftly accepted and joined up with us. Dispatching the Sirens became the top priority for both our fleets.<br>
As our force consisted of ships with wildly varying strengths and weaknesses, we agreed the best strategy was to split up and attack from multiple angles.<br>
All seemed fine, until the Sirens came fully into view... They weren't the ones that had pursued us.<br>
Their hulls were decorated with striking patterns. Their armor was so thick even a battleship's main guns only scratched it.<br>
And their firepower... It was unlike anything I'd ever seen. It effortlessly tore through our armor that had previously weathered countless hits.<br>
One volley was all it took to neutralize half our fleet. Our formation fell apart, as one might expect...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Emden：</span><br>
"Indeed. Those Sirens – they were on a whole other level."<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
What was the Royal Navy fleet doing?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Emden：</span><br>
"They had gone another way to engage a different Siren fleet."<br>
"I can only imagine they had a much harder fight than us, even if they didn't have to face any new Sirens."<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Warspite：</span><br>
Royal Navy! Find and engage the enemy!<br>
Expel those beasts from our home waters!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yorck：</span><br>
Launching a counterattack with a force that size? Do they have a death wish?<br>
Just look what happened to our superior fleet. It's in shambles after that last attack...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Thüringen：</span><br>
Still, you have to applaud their courage.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lützow：</span><br>
Recklessness, more like. Either way, fine by me if those suckers go belly up.<br>
Probably gonna happen any second now. The odds are stacked hard against them.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Seydlitz：</span><br>
The Sirens are far more powerful than us! Even if by some miracle we manage to defeat them, it'll cost us nearly our whole fleet!<br>
Emden, I advise that we retreat now while we still have the strength and time!<br>
If we do not make it back to port, nobody will know just how dangerous these new Sirens are!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Emden：</span><br>
"Tsk... We've no other choice. Retreat at once."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lützow：</span><br>
Already? Works for me. Toodles, Royal Navy!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
So you turned your backs on them and ran?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Emden：</span><br>
"Who wouldn't have? There was no way we could defeat those Sirens."<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
What you're saying is... our fleet just...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Emden：</span><br>
"Let us finish. We knew the Royal Navy's ships were all doomed if we fled."<br>
"So we changed our minds. Instead, we came to their rescue."<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
...You did? That was quite valorous of you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Emden：</span><br>
It was a move brought on by desperation as much as valor.<br>
"We knew not how fast these new Sirens were. They may well have chased us down if the Royal Navy couldn't keep them busy for long enough."<br>
That being the case, we came to aid them in exchange for being allowed inside Scapa Flow.<br>
"We all know just how vital Scapa Flow was to your operations out here."<br>
"And because of its strategical significance, you've gone far out of your way to reinforce it."<br>
All the facilities one could need. Astounding defenses. Massive stockpiles of supplies. It was such a perfect base, not even the Sirens dared attack it.<br>
"If we could make it there, the Sirens could be repelled and we could contact our superiors. Frankly, it was our one and only option for survival."<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Did our fleet agree to this proposal?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Emden：</span><br>
"Yes. Swiftly, much like with the ceasefire."<br>
"Our fleets regrouped, and together, we sailed for Scapa Flow as quickly as we could."<br>
<br>
Scapa Flow Harbor<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Warspite：</span><br>
We're out of the woods now. Welcome to our pride and honour – Scapa Flow.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Seydlitz：</span><br>
Thank you, Lady Warspite! Thank all of you, my friends, for your graceful assistance!<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Valiant ：</span><br>
Sure. Now that you're well into our domain, it's time for that inspection.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lützow：</span><br>
Aww, come on! What's the point in doing that now?<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Valiant ：</span><br>
Your fleet has taken significant damage, has it not? An inspection is a prerequisite for repairs.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lützow：</span><br>
Oh. Fair enough. Inspect whoever you need to, then.<br>
I made it out without a scratch, so I'll just have a nap. For business inquiries, talk to Emden and Seydlitz.<br>
Also, where's the VIP lounge? This place is too big NOT to have one.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Valiant ：</span><br>
You crash at somebody's place and expect VIP treatment? That's brave...<br>
Come with me. I shall guide you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
From wary strangers to friends just like that, huh?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Emden：</span><br>
Indeed. Let this story be remembered as a shining example of sisterhood on the battlefield.<br>
"It was an uneasy union, but a union nonetheless. Our enemies were Sirens, not fellow shipgirls."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Yeah, and that still rings true.<br>
Hang on, the fact remains that something bad went down at Scapa Flow...<br>
Which can only mean... the Sirens DID attack after all!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Emden：</span><br>
Well deduced. The whole story is a little more complicated than that, however.<br>
"At first, everything was normal. We stocked up on supplies, patched ourselves up..."<br>
"Then, at some point, we lost all contact with the outside world."<br>
"Our communicators should've been working, which made us suspect some kind of Royal Navy interference. However, they were having the same problem."<br>
"That, in turn, led us to the conclusion that it was the Sirens' doing."<br>
"It was then that the seas and skies turned a strange color, and Scapa Flow's harbor – all of it – began to rumble."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
The telltale signs of a Mirror Sea...!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Emden：</span><br>
Is that what you call it? How novel. We had no words for it until now.<br>
"After that otherworldly phenomenon began, the Sirens sent in their airwings."<br>
"Their planes weren't like what you carriers use. Compared to the planes of our time, they were far, far more destructive."<br>
"It's a mystery how their planes even reached the island. It should've been far beyond their reach."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
I reckon the Sirens had an aircraft carrier deployed nearby.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Emden：</span><br>
"Yes, we know that now. But the past Emden could never have guessed that."<br>
Ah, carrier-based aircraft. Aren't they a marvel of scientific ingenuity?<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
......<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Seydlitz：</span><br>
The Royal Navy's coastal batteries were key to our survival of the Sirens' third wave of attack.<br>
Even so, we were at the end of our rope, and we knew it. Our only option was to flee Scapa Flow posthaste.<br>
But... The moment we put our escape plan into motion, a beam of light shot down from the sky... and that's where my memory stops.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Emden：</span><br>
Sadly, I know not who or what created that light, nor what its purpose was.<br>
"That is the end of our story. We've no more we can tell you."<br>
"The light obliterated all Iron Blood and Royal Navy forces on Scapa Flow. At least, assuming the record of this place is accurate."<br>
And that is the truth. The truth you so badly wanted to know.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
It seems the pieces are falling into place.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
This information differs from what our higher-ups have. Truly, this changes everything... <br>
The incident at Scapa Flow was neither the product of a Royal Navy betrayal, nor Iron Blood foolishness...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
I've got a theory on that light... It all makes sense if that was Purifier's omitter beam.<br>
None of us have ever personally seen a weapon that can raze an entire base in an instant, but that's the only lead I've got.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Emden：</span><br>
I trust your insight. You've fought more Sirens than any of us.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
I've fought those assholes more times than I can remember... But I do remember everything about them.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Seydlitz：</span><br>
It is an honor to be in the presence of such seasoned, noble warriors!<br>
If our fleet had had someone like you by our side, things would surely have gone another way.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
I have a proposition. Do you think you could eliminate the Sirens around here?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Seydlitz：</span><br>
What, exactly, are you asking of us?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
If this test site was built to effectively replicate the events of Scapa Flow, there must be info on this laser weapon of theirs somewhere here.<br>
Furthermore, it's worth gauging the strength of that new Siren model, as compared to us.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Thüringen：</span><br>
In other words, you're giving us the opportunity to avenge our former selves?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yorck：</span><br>
Not just that, it's good practice for getting used to our new riggings – and bodies.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Elbing：</span><br>
O-okay... I hope we'll adjust well and dest– Err, excuse me. Everything I wish for never comes true...<br>
Ahem... I hope that we'll never encounter any enemies... that the laser beam will destroy us all...<br>
And of course, that I'll sink to the bottom of the ocean...!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yorck：</span><br>
You could just not hope for anything and save yourself the effort.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Emden：</span><br>
Friedrich der Große, is that an order? An order, as the one who gave us new lives and brought us to the Iron Blood?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
It is no order.<br>
However, you as shipgirls have a duty to fulfill – to defeat the Sirens and defend humanity's oceans.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Emden：</span><br>
"Seydlitz, go and wake Lützow. We have enemies to fell."<br>
Heehee... How exciting it is to be fighting once again.<br>

Outside the Singularity - NA Ocean<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z2：</span><br>
Eugen, you've tampered with the radar, haven't you?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Not this time. What's wrong with it?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z2：</span><br>
"Not this time"... I see...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Really, I haven't. You're wondering about the Eagle Union and Northern Parliament fleets, aren't you?<br>
I'll tell you right now, they're both actually here. Naval HQ greenlit this operation.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z2：</span><br>
Have they? That explains it.<br>
I see some of our forces are gearing up for battle. Are we not here simply to stall for time?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Not quite. When push comes to shove, you need to be ready to fight back.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z2：</span><br>
Then allow me to transfer the recon data we've gathered. It should arrive in time.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Don't. You have to save it for after at least a skirmish has broken out.<br>
They've assembled a massive fleet, you know. We need to show them we mean business too.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z2：</span><br>
I don't like it when you use the phrase "mean business"... Should I start writing my will?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Not today. I promise to keep you safe, Z2.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z2：</span><br>
Please extend that promise to my little Lebe. In fact, to our entire fleet, if you would.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
I'm already doing my best to keep the Azur Lane at bay through radar jamming.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z2：</span><br>
They'll see through the jamming as soon as they get close. What's more, I dare say you're going overkill with it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Sure, they'll see through it, but then it's too late. Besides, overkill is the way to go when stalling for time.<br>
While they scramble to work around the jamming... Bam, that's when we strike. Then we have a shot at winning.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z2：</span><br>
So that's the plan... I cannot deny it is sound, at least in theory.<br>
You're sortieing too, aren't you? What is your target? Surely not the Commander's personal fleet, I hope.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Please, why would I be? The Commander's our guest.<br>
(Our next operation will run into difficulties if we commit too much to this one. But if we don't commit enough, we can expect Naval HQ to keep a watchful eye on us...)<br>
Tell you what – we'll go for the Northern Parliament's fleet.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z2：</span><br>
Very well then. I assume we have no other choice anyway.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
You assume correctly.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z2：</span><br>
As I tend to do... If we must fight, so be it, but please try not to aggravate them too much.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Don't worry, I can't even if I wanted to. It's my job to keep adjusting the frequency on this little jammer.<br>

<br>
Inside the Singularity - Mirror Sea<br>
The Iron Blood ships were the backbone of this new combined fleet. Led by Zuikaku's planes, they set out to sea in search of Sirens.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
This is Zuikaku. Sirens spotted, 10 o'clock! They'll be on us momentarily!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Seydlitz：</span><br>
Thank you kindly, Lady Zuikaku!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Don't mention it – I'm here to help!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Seydlitz：</span><br>
Then I have all the more reason to thank you!<br>
Replotting course. We shall cut in diagonally and attack from their side!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lützow：</span><br>
So these are the kinds of tactics a carrier employs. Neato.<br>
Let's see you try to sink more tonnage than my main guns can, though!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
The enemy force consists only of mass-produced ships. No humanoid Sirens!<br>
Should be good for a warmup! Just don't get too cocky because these are Mark II's.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Thüringen：</span><br>
Mark II's? Is that their official designation?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Yeah? Why do you ask?<br>
Are they the same model that attacked Scapa Flow, by any chance?<br>
...Never mind, I'm dumb. Mark II's didn't start appearing until waaay after Scapa Flow.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Elbing：</span><br>
How can you tell they're Mark II's? Is it the blue, glowing patterns on their hulls...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Yup! That means they have reinforced armor, which... Oh, that explains why regular warships couldn't damage them.<br>
Even modern mass-produced ships would struggle with these Sirens...<br>
It wouldn't even be a fight if we pitted the warships of Scapa Flow against them... It'd be a one-sided slaughter.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lützow：</span><br>
Well, if the records are right, those warships DID manage to sink one or two Siren vessels.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
But how?! They couldn't even break through their armor!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Seydlitz：</span><br>
With sheer willpower, training, and most important of all, an unbending fighting spirit. That is what I believe.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
I... I can believe that. You can overcome numbers and equipment with enough determination...<br>
It's as Mikasa once said... On-paper stats aren't what's important – your will to fight is.<br>
That's how you overcame the trials of the first great war. Not thanks just to strength, but also with a desire to protect humanity and its seas!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lützow：</span><br>
Yeah, but that wasn't exactly us. Thank the people who actually fought in that war.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
(I wonder if Akagi and Kaga ended up the way they did because they lost their way – and their will to fight...)<br>
Listen! These Sirens are pushovers for shipgirls like us! They don't stand a chance against our riggings!<br>
So go and give 'em hell!<br>

<br>
KABOOOM!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lützow：</span><br>
Direct hit! Damn, I'm good.<br>
Fighting with a rigging is pretty fun, actually.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Thüringen：</span><br>
All the power of a warship compressed into a weapon on the scale of a human...<br>
With a rigging, a single soldier can accomplish what once took an entire crew to do.<br>
It's no wonder that shipgirls made warships obsolete.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lützow：</span><br>
Plus, we're way smaller targets, so they're gonna miss most shots.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Thüringen：</span><br>
Yes, but that doesn't mean you should make like a sitting duck.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lützow：</span><br>
I'm cool with being a sitting duck if it can't hit me regardless.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Seydlitz：</span><br>
......<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yorck：</span><br>
What's the matter, Seydlitz?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Seydlitz：</span><br>
It's just... As I was calibrating my main guns, it dawned on me that it will be a long while before I master my rigging.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yorck：</span><br>
Want some help with that? Heavy cruisers and battlecruisers must have at least a few attributes in common.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Seydlitz：</span><br>
Yes, please! First of all, if you could look at this...<br>
<br>
KABOOOM!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Elbing：</span><br>
I... I hit the target?<br>
I sank it, too?! How in the world did my peashooter cannons manage that...?<br>
Oh, it must be because of my wish that I wouldn't land any successful hits. Thank goodness...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Seydlitz：</span><br>
It wasn't a fluke, Elbing. You've simply become stronger.<br>
Put your faith in yourself and your rigging, and you'll realize your full potential.<br>
I believe in you. These insignificant Sirens are no match for you!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yorck：</span><br>
Enemy planes on the horizon! Ready your anti-air weapons!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lützow：</span><br>
Planes, eh? Time to put this baby's AA capabilities to the test!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Thüringen：</span><br>
Ditto. The more acquainted we become with our arsenals, the better.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Elbing：</span><br>
I-I think I should just fall back...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Seydlitz：</span><br>
There is no need to, Elbing! Get behind me!<br>
<br>
KABOOOM!<br>
The aircraft dropped their payloads over Seydlitz, but only scored near misses. Her allies trained their AA guns on the planes and promptly shot them down.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Seydlitz：</span><br>
Enemy aircraft neutralized! Excellent. Now I also have a good idea of what our armor can withstand.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Emden：</span><br>
Why weather the enemy's attacks when one can evade them?<br>
<br>
The Swan of the East gracefully moved out of the way of incoming machine-gun fire, then retaliated with attacks of her own.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lützow：</span><br>
Wow, look at you. You've already become a pro at this.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Emden：</span><br>
"Emden's strength is not to be scoffed at, Lützow."<br>
We are a long way away from perfection, but an average battle poses no issue to us.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lützow：</span><br>
...You have it easy just 'cause there's two of you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Emden：</span><br>
If you have something you wish to say, speak up and look us in the eye.<br>
"And if you've the time for that, use it on fighting instead. Emden will not tolerate any laziness."<br>

<br>
A group of shipgirls watched from afar as the reborn warships practiced with their riggings.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Looks like they've gotten the hang of it. Taking out the small fry Sirens around here should be a breeze for them.<br>
Once that's done, I reckon we can start surveying the area beyond the anchorage.<br>
Then there's only one thing left to do – find out what that Siren superweapon was.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
(Friedrich has done it again...)<br>
(The power balance between the four big factions is at risk of collapsing entirely if the Iron Blood's forces keep growing at this rate.)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
...Akagi?<br>
Is there something on your mind?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
No, nothing in particular.<br>
Say, Zuikaku, have we ever needed to learn the very basics of our riggings?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Now that you mention it... No. We do study the specifics of new planes and gear and the like, but that's different.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
I long thought it impossible to directly compare Sakura Empire and Iron Blood riggings due to their design differences. It seems I was wrong.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Wrong? How so? Is there something unusual about theirs?<br>
They look in line with all other Iron Blood riggings I've seen before...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Think about it. Mikasa predates even those girls, but she never had to learn how to use her rigging.<br>
This is only speculation, but I see this as a strong indication that those girls were never meant to equip these riggings.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
Heheh. How perceptive you are.<br>
The notion that the Cube creates rigging based on a particular ship's hull is not entirely true. While this does occur in many instances, it is a guideline rather than a hard rule.<br>
We learned this through our research. All I've done here is put it to good use.<br>
Let me remind you, Akagi, that our rondo is still underway.<br>
Please be patient and see it to its conclusion. I assure you, you will not be disappointed.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
...Very well. I will do as you say and wait for the finale.<br>
(That's assuming Azur Lane doesn't show up and end her performance prematurely, anyway.)<br>
(The clock is ticking on the Singularity. Friedrich is wasting time on these frivolities...)<br>
......<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
......<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
......<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Why are you staring at me?<br>
You and I are both spectators here. I cannot speculate on what Friedrich's grand plan is.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
(Then there's Elizabeth... It'd be naive to think she's granting us access to Scapa Flow just out of the kindness of her heart.)<br>
(There must be something of greater importance to this place than what we've seen so far.)<br>
(I can only hope the Commander knows what that is... But if not...)<br>

KABOOOM!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Thüringen：</span><br>
Direct hit. We've broken up the Sirens' fleet.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yorck：</span><br>
Fascinating. It seems charging in is a valid strategy when you're a shipgirl.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lützow：</span><br>
Warships can do that too! Though they'll get lit up like a Christmas tree.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Thüringen：</span><br>
Speaking of which, we've only fought warship-sized Sirens thus far. Zuikaku mentioned "humanoid Sirens" in passing earlier.<br>
I imagine they're in a league of their own. Running and gunning like this will only work on small groups of big enemies.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Seydlitz：</span><br>
Should it come down to a point-blank fight with a human-sized adversary, my sword will come in handy!<br>
Even if all my shells are spent, I can keep fighting the Sirens!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lützow：</span><br>
Knock yourself out. Me, I'd just call it quits at that point.<br>
On another note, is anyone else curious how inter-faction relations have developed?<br>
Putting aside the obvious stuff anyone can infer, anyway.<br>
You reckon things are getting tense because of this operation they've got going?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Thüringen：</span><br>
It's safe to say there are at least two major camps: the Azur Lane and the Crimson Axis.<br>
The Azur Lane seems to be under Naval HQ's joint command, whereas the Iron Blood is the de-facto representative of the Crimson Axis.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lützow：</span><br>
Sooo... Which side is fighting the Sirens? They can't still be fighting among themselves, surely.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yorck：</span><br>
Both of them do. They have the same objective, but differ in how they aim to achieve it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Emden：</span><br>
That is human nature – to splinter off into groups that fight among each other.<br>
"However, they can achieve incredible things on the rare occasions they come together as one."<br>
"Taken as individuals, they are frail, powerless, and always yearning for stability."<br>
That's what makes them so sweet. Heehee...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lützow：</span><br>
Weird definition of "sweet," but you do you...<br>
Speaking of coming together, anyone else find it interesting how representatives from the Iron Blood, Sakura Empire, and Royal Navy are all in one place to do something other than fight?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Seydlitz：</span><br>
It is unusual, yes. Perhaps they've managed to purge the Sirens from their world... or they now face a threat even bigger than them?<br>
Either way, they deserve respect for all the battles they've fought leading up to today.<br>
Remember what Friedrich said – a shipgirl's duty is to wage war on the Sirens, not her own kind.<br>
We are soldiers, which is both our greatest strength and greatest flaw.<br>
Our forte is fighting, not unifying all of humanity. Only one person can reforge the Azur Lane of old...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Emden：</span><br>
The one known as the Commander.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Seydlitz：</span><br>
Indeed. All shipgirls, regardless of affiliation, are welcome under the Commandant's banner.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Emden：</span><br>
"To think a feeble human would be the key to a peaceful future."<br>
<br>
The Iron Blood shipgirls became more and more proficient at tracking and sinking Sirens as they accustomed to their new riggings.<br>
The former warships that were hunted down at Scapa Flow had now become the hunters.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Emden：</span><br>
I wish to see this Commander – my darling human – for myself. Heehee...<br>

<br>
The group's search for leads on the Siren superweapon had been fruitless. Worse yet, the gate to the Singularity would not last much longer.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Time is running out. How much longer until it closes, Zuikaku?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Don't worry, we have enough time. Though we should start getting ready to leave.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lützow：</span><br>
Hey, Friedrich. We're done.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
There you are. I take it the fighting was rejuvenating?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lützow：</span><br>
You bet. It was a great, fun workout!<br>
Until a point, anyway. Then it stopped being gratifying altogether.<br>
When victory comes too easily, fighting just becomes a chore, you know?<br>
Kind of feels like I'm making light of warship-me's efforts, too. "Look how easily I can beat these Sirens that annihilated you!"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
Don't feel that way. That other you did the best she could, just as you're doing now.<br>
It's pointless to measure the past by the standards of the present.<br>
Now... Do you feel ready to tackle a stronger adversary?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Seydlitz：</span><br>
Affirmative! Fighting in the name of humanity and the Iron Blood is my mission!<br>
Please, formally reintegrate us into the Iron Blood!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
There is no need to reintegrate you, because the Iron Blood never left you behind. <br>
You've always been with us, my children.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Emden：</span><br>
"How terribly sentimental for someone who is evidently manipulative."<br>
For the record, we are not your children.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
Then I won't call you that. All I wish to say is that anyone willing to fight for Iron Blood is family to me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
...This was your goal all along, wasn't it, Friedrich?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
Not quite. It wasn't my sole goal, simply one of them.<br>
These girls will serve the Iron Blood well, but they are only the prelude for the greater things to come.<br>
You've been with me on this journey. You've seen the same things I have.<br>
Naval HQ's falsehoods. The truth we learned in this place. The infinite potential of Wisdom Cubes.<br>
The finale is yet to come, Akagi.<br>
And I promise, it will not disappoint you, or Her Majesty, or the people outside the Singularity... or my child.<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Georgia：</span><br>
All right, Commander. It's time for a mission briefing.<br>
Almost all our fleets across this entire ocean sector are engaging the Iron Blood.<br>
Though we greatly outnumber them, their jamming has thrown a wrench into our plan.<br>
Let me break it down fleet by fleet. Our fleet has mainly only encountered jamming and a few ghost fleets. They've not done too much to slow us down.<br>
The Northern Parliament's fleet was intercepted by the Iron Blood, so they're expected to arrive behind schedule.<br>
Lastly, New Jersey's fleet. Hers is also in the midst of trading shots with the Iron Blood.<br>
As for our rear guard... Iron Blood submarines have been ambushing them. That's one of the reasons our advance has been going slowly.<br>
All that is to say, while things are taking longer than expected, everything is going more or less as planned.<br>
...Wait, we just received new intel. Let's see here...<br>
Huh. Blips 26, 30, and 31 have been identified as fake targets. I'll remove them from our map.<br>
<br>
"Great, that's three we can rule out. How many more are there?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Georgia：</span><br>
71, in total.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："We have our work cut out for us, huh..."</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Georgia：</span><br>
Yup. Our recon planes can't identify them from afar either, thanks to their optical camouflage.<br>
The only way we can identify fake targets is by getting in close. Our planes would get promptly shot down if they tried that.<br>
<br>
"Worse yet, it's impossible to pinpoint their flagship fleet with this many blips on the map."<br>
"The Iron Blood knows their technology, and they're really making the most of it."<br>
"It doesn't change the fact our forces far eclipse theirs, though. Sooner or later, their plan is going to fall apart."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Georgia：</span><br>
Exactly. They're succeeding at slowing our advance, but they can't stop it without inflicting actual damage to us.<br>
Give it some time and we'll be able to counteract their jamming as well.<br>
<br>
"This all begs the question – why are they stalling us to begin with? Are they buying time for reinforcements?"<br>
"Or... Maybe this has something to do with Friedrich's request for information surrounding Wisdom Cubes. The one she made a while back."<br>
"But who knows. Cubes, Singularities, this whole thing... It's often a mystery what goes on inside her head."<br>
"Just thinking about it gives me a headache."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Communicator：</span><br>
BEEP BEEP BEEP!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Eldridge：</span><br>
Commander... Your communicator.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Georgia：</span><br>
If it's Naval HQ, let's hope they're not in a sour mood. Heh.<br>
<br>
I picked up the communicator, which made the screen before me flash with the caller's ID.<br>
"It's... Soyuz?"<br>

NA Ocean<br>
As Kronshtadt was leading the Northern Parliament's fleet forward, a familiar figure approached her from over the horizon.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Ah, Kronshtadt. What a pleasant surprise.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kronshtadt：</span><br>
Prinz Eugen? Why in the world are you here?<br>
First thing's first – we're on a mission. Come any closer and I'll shoot you.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Aww. You were a lot more friendly at our last drinking party.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kronshtadt：</span><br>
This isn't a social event, sweetie.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Fair enough, but who's to say we can't socialize a little? What are you doing here?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kronshtadt：</span><br>
My job. What else should I be doing?<br>
And don't say "drinking with me." That's not going to happen.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
A shame, because I'd love a beer. We could drink, chat, share faction secrets, and so on.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kronshtadt：</span><br>
I definitely wouldn't mind hearing a few Iron Blood secrets, but I'm staying sober.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
You're sounding like Kirov now. What's wrong with treating yourself?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kronshtadt：</span><br>
Nothing, but I'll pass on the alcohol. We could talk over dinner sometime, though.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Dinner would be nice, but I was hoping for a little... more. You've changed in the time you went MIA.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kronshtadt：</span><br>
As have you. I see you've worked your way up to the position of Friedrich's little errand girl.<br>
I would ask what your goal here is, but I know you won't give me a straight answer. Instead, let me give you something – a piece of advice.<br>
If you keep playing this game of lies and deception, you'll one day lose sight of the truth.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Spoken like a woman who's frustrated that her own deception always falls flat.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kronshtadt：</span><br>
Oh yeah? If you think you're so much better, let's see you try to deceive your way out of us taking you prisoner.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Hahahah! What, do you expect me to simply turn around and let you cuff me?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kronshtadt：</span><br>
If you want to do it the easy way, yes. The hard way entails us blasting you to bits first! Fire!<br>
<br>
KABOOOM!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kronshtadt：</span><br>
What?! The shots passed right through her?! Tsk, she's just a projection!<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Bingo. Thanks for letting me have some of your precious time, by the way.<br>
As much as this pains me, I have to create the conditions for an uphill battle for you girls.<br>
Odin! You're up!<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Odin：</span><br>
Very well. Energy levels at maximum...<br>
This is the end for you! Herteitr's Rolling Thunder!<br>

Scapa Flow - Harbor<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jintsuu：</span><br>
It's terribly quiet... And the Iron Blood's ships are nowhere to be seen.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
Ägir and August von Parseval will remain behind as well then. If the Azur Lane comes, you know what to do.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jintsuu：</span><br>
Friedrich said they'd be here. The fact they aren't makes me think they were diverted to the frontlines.<br>
I was under the impression this wasn't our fight. Perhaps soon it will be, though...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yamashiro：</span><br>
Well, Akagi did give us orders to back you up if the Azur Lane shows up!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yukikaze：</span><br>
You should've brought Yukikaze the Great along! Then this stroke of bad luck would've never happened!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shoukaku：</span><br>
Have you still not heard anything from Zuikaku?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kaga：</span><br>
She's with Akagi. No harm will come to her as long as the Azur Lane doesn't reach us.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shoukaku：</span><br>
Given how the situation is developing, that's not very reassuring... If Iron Blood deployed their forces to the frontlines, thing must be quite dire.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kaga：</span><br>
I see your point. Though there's still a fair distance between us and the fighting, my recon planes are already picking up smoke clouds.<br>
They're headed straight for us, that much is clear. What I can't say is whether or not they know we are here.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shoukaku：</span><br>
Maybe they hope to ascertain the Royal Navy's intentions? None of their faction leaders know about their involvement in this operation.<br>
...Either which way, I'll do as Akagi said and head there.<br>
Let's just hope the Sakura Empire won't need to join the fight today.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kaga：</span><br>
Got it. I'll let Akagi know you–<br>
<br>
All of a sudden, the placid Singularity roared. A beam of light burst out from its gateway.<br>
The energy spike made the water's surface boil. Amid the steam, a figure clad in a red kimono descended.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kaga：</span><br>
Akagi?! Are you all right? How are things beyond the gate?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
I'm fine, as is Zuikaku. We just got done witnessing something very, very interesting.<br>
Though now's not the time to talk about it. That comes later.<br>
I see you and Jintsuu are the only ones here... The Azur Lane has made a move, hasn't it?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kaga：</span><br>
Correct. They're headed for us right now.<br>
The Iron Blood is employing stalling tactics, but it's only a matter of time before they'll reach us.<br>
Shoukaku just said she's on the way. If we're lucky, we can escape before the Azur Lane arrives.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Escape? Don't be ridiculous. Everything is going exactly according to plan.<br>
You've done well, guarding the gate, but now it's time for us to join the fight.<br>
I know you think I sound crazy. We're outnumbered and seemingly have our backs against the wall...<br>
To which I say – it's a good thing we made some new friends inside the Singularity.<br>
<br>
Akagi gestured towards the gateway to dispel Kaga's confusion.<br>
Zuikaku was first to return, then Friedrich, then Queen Elizabeth... Everyone who had entered was back.<br>
But then came the party of Iron Blood ships given new life. As the last one exited, the gate faded into specks of nothingness.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kaga：</span><br>
Are they... META ships?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
No. They are ordinary shipgirls like us.<br>
Friedrich needed more cards in her hand to accomplish the true goal of this operation. Now she has them.<br>

Northern Parliament Control Center - Commanding Vessel<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Georgia：</span><br>
Commander, I've come to update you on the situation.<br>
Soyuz's fleet is in the midst of encircling Scapa Flow, as planned.<br>
New Jersey's fleet is also on the move, but progress is still slow owing to Iron Blood's jamming and stalling tactics.<br>
Speaking of the Iron Blood, we've caught wind of the fact they're fielding blueprint ships.<br>
Most of them are under Ulrich's command. She seems to be making a beeline for this very fleet.<br>
Our forces are spread out because of all the jamming, so stopping Ulrich's fleet in its tracks will be difficult.<br>
But, if they do reach us, we can deal with them just fine. You're with us, after all.<br>
<br>
"Sounds like whatever they do, it won't be enough to turn the battle in their favor."<br>
"Just earlier, I heard Iron Blood planes have been spotted as well. I'll notify Enterprise's reserve fleet to be on their guard."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Georgia：</span><br>
The fact they're fielding blueprint ships now has me a bit wary, though...<br>
<br>
"You're right to be. Every faction voiced concerns over blueprint ships as this operation was being drafted, too. Soyuz insisted there wouldn't be any."<br>
"One of her informants had said so. Allegedly. Looking back at it now, she might just have been bluffing for the sake of getting the operation approved..."<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："Have you heard anything from the Royal Navy?"</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Georgia：</span><br>
You mean regarding Scapa Flow? They're still dancing around the subject.<br>
One minute they say they can't get in touch with anyone at the base, the next they say it's largely irrelevant to the operation at hand.<br>
Curiously, Her Majesty has also been telling us not to worry about it.<br>
All signs point toward an Iron Blood invasion, but then why is the Royal Navy being so uncooperative? Scapa Flow is still an important base to them.<br>
If they wanted to hide something from us, it'd be the ideal location for it, too.<br>
<br>
"An invasion does seem like the likeliest answer. If this operation is intended as a retaliatory attack against the Iron Blood, why are we headed for a Royal Navy anchorage?"<br>
"And for that matter, why would the Iron Blood attack Scapa Flow to begin with?"<br>
"Friedrich and Elizabeth will both have some explaining to do the next time I see them."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Georgia：</span><br>
Guess we'll have to find out for ourselves...<br>
Sorry for changing topics, but would you let me deal with Ulrich's fleet, Commander?<br>
Your fleet is more than enough to handle hers, but that would take time, and we've been stalled long enough as it is.<br>
I just need a few others to come with me. We'll head out and intercept Ulrich's blueprint brigade to ensure you have a clear path to Scapa Flow.<br>
We've identified the majority of the blips on the map by now, and if Friedrich's anywhere, she should be in the harbor.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："All right. Permission granted to sortie."</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2："Do it, and treat yourself to an Oxy-cola."</span>'''''<br>

Scapa Flow Harbor<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yorck：</span><br>
Well, this scenery sure is different to the Mirror Sea.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lützow：</span><br>
No wrecks, no devastation, none of that stuff... Is this how Scapa Flow really looks?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Thüringen：</span><br>
The ruined Scapa Flow was only a fabrication from the past. This is the real – future – Scapa Flow.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lützow：</span><br>
Wow, so we're back to the future! I've always wanted to be a time traveler!<br>
Seriously though, you can't convince me we DIDN'T just travel through time.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Emden：</span><br>
Pray tell, did the Sirens attack this place recently? I see some signs of damage.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kaga：</span><br>
There was an attack, yeah, but it was orchestrated by the Iron Blood as part of a separate operation.<br>
In short, the Royal Navy was lured away from here while Tirpitz and Deutschland launched a surprise attack.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Emden：</span><br>
"Interesting. The Iron Blood has only gotten craftier with the passage of time."<br>
I look forward to meeting our compatriots from the future.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kaga：</span><br>
Compatriots? You mean the shipgirls allied in the fight against the Sirens, or the Crimson Axis – allied in the fight against the Azur Lane?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Emden：</span><br>
"Both."<br>
When the Iron Blood's navy turned to ashes, the Crimson Axis rose from them like a phoenix...<br>
我们的失败让铁血彻底失去了海上力量因此转而寻求与其他阵营联合是必然的。<br>
A union created due to an external threat is highly unstable. When the external threat weakens, so does the union's cohesion.<br>
"The Crimson Axis being established as a result was only to be expected."<br>
Conflict is human nature. When there is nobody left to, humans will make enemies of each other.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kaga：</span><br>
这就是公海舰队看待问题的方式么……<br>
Alliances change with time. Any of our factions could be friend or foe depending on what date you turn the clock to.<br>
Let us hope this alliance between us will last for a long time.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lützow：</span><br>
刚刚{namecode:96}也说了跟你差不多的话呢~你是叫{namecode:92}对吧？<br>
Ex-battleship turned carrier, just like Akagi, right?<br>
And Amagi, I think? Preeetty sure there were plans to convert her to a carrier.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kaga：</span><br>
Correct. As long as the hull is the same, you can change designations to a certain degree.<br>
However, it takes an absurd amount of time and resources. Even the big four factions don't do it often.<br>
If Amagi hadn't suffered the fate she did, I likely wouldn't been converted...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Seydlitz：</span><br>
Though I've been granted this rigging, the fact remains that I am an old warship. I thought it possible to become an asset in battle through training...<br>
Alas, what you're suggesting is that there are limits to what is possible.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kaga：</span><br>
You're already a great asset as far as I can tell.<br>
If there's anything you lack, it's plain old experience.<br>
And if you ever need to modify your equipment, Iron Blood technology makes that easy.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Seydlitz：</span><br>
Really? Then I think I'll ask Lady Friedrich for a few more main cannons!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kaga：</span><br>
Okay, that's simply not going to happen.<br>
(Though, this is the Iron Blood we're talking about, so I could be wrong about that...)<br>
<br>
While Seydlitz and Kaga were exchanging words, Akagi interjected.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Zuikaku, have you seen Elizabeth?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Hey, yeah... I coud've sworn she was with us a moment ago!<br>
Unless... Don't tell me she didn't make it through the Singularity in time...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
Her Majesty made it out, don't worry. She simply has other business to attend to.<br>
Besides, she cannot let herself be seen among our ranks during this operation. I had to let her go.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
A shame. She could've been an ace up your sleeve if you took her hostage.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
I've no need for another ace, Akagi.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
My, my. Your sleeves must be quite stuffed, then.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
What if I told you my hand was already a royal flush?<br>
The only question is how I'll put my cards on the table.<br>
Seeing as Ägir and August von Parseval are absent, I assume everything is proceeding according to plan?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kaga：</span><br>
Seems so. We don't know if they're managing to keep the Azur Lane busy, though.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
That depends solely on how astute they – and my child – are.<br>
We are just the orchestra. Our task is simply to keep performing this rondo.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lützow：</span><br>
Sooo... What do we do now? Go beat up the Azur Lane and take their lunch money?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
You're free to fight as much as you like, if that's what you're asking.<br>
But before that, you should stock up on ammunition at Scapa Flow. You nearly expended every last shell inside the Mirror Sea.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Emden：</span><br>
Then replenish our ammunition we shall.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Thüringen：</span><br>
A shipgirl can't fight on an empty magazine, after all.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yorck：</span><br>
Don't mind if I do. You too, Elbing. Come along.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Elbing：</span><br>
Okay... I bet the ammo will be full of duds, and that my cannons will jam...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
You needn't reverse-jinx yourself, Elbing.<br>
You are strong and capable. Your friends all appreciate you. That is the truth, whether you accept it or not.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Elbing：</span><br>
Er...! S-sorry, I'd better hurry along...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lützow：</span><br>
Me too, probably. I'll have a quick nap while I'm at it.<br>
Wake me when the fighting starts.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Seydlitz：</span><br>
I shall see to it that she does! Please excuse us!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
What will the rest of you do? The Sakura Empire has no reason to be fighting this battle.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Perhaps not, but your rondo hasn't concluded yet, has it?<br>
So, I'd like to resupply as well. Do you mind?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
Not at all.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
I'm still good on supplies! I didn't do any fighting in that Mirror Sea.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
You may not have engaged in battle, but planes and engines don't power themselves.<br>
Restock on fuel while you can. It's free, so why pass on it?<br>
Think of it as a reward for for your efforts, if that makes you feel any better.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Well... I don't really expect a reward.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
But you deserve one for your participation in this battle. You'll want to claim it in advance.<br>
You will serve us all – my child included – better with your fuel tank and magazines topped off.<br>
Go on. I insist.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Allow me to confirm it one last time. We are permitted to fight the Commander?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
Yes. You have my permission to do so.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Heheh... I look forward to seeing how this goes.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
呵呵呵~现在正在上演的可是铁血乐章精彩的最终章。<br>
不论接下来发生什么事，都一定目不转睛的见证到最后哟。<br>

<br>
"Um, thanks, Eldridge. I think I'll read the rest for myself, if you don't mind."<br>
A short while later...<br>
Based on the reports from all our fleets, it seemed the Iron Blood's strategy had changed.<br>
They had given up on their electronic interference and stalling tactics and instead rallied all their forces at Scapa Flow.<br>
Had our attacks put them on the back foot? Were they done trying to diverge our attention away from whatever they were hiding? Nobody knew.<br>
Kronshtadt's fleet had apparently engaged Odin, and they survived the battle without any major casualties.<br>
Georgia's fleet fought Ulrich's fleet and, incredibly, won. The former was now on its way back to regroup with us, while the latter broke off to retreat.<br>
Lastly, New Jersey's fleet defeated Tirpitz's fleet, but sustained minor damage after a battle with Ulrich's fleet as it was retreating.<br>
All in all, though the Iron Blood had fought admirably, they were still losing the battle.<br>
I still had no idea what Friedrich's goal was, but it seemed to me like her plan was going to be a bust.<br>
I kicked back in my seat, drew a sigh, and reviewed our fleets' statuses once more.<br>
Saratoga's reserve fleet had linked up with ours. I now commanded a very respectable fleet for the final battle.<br>
I had all the right cards in my hand. All I had to do was bring them to the table.<br>

<br>
Scapa Flow - Nearby Waters<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
Commander, we've located the remaining Iron Blood forces, as well as Friedrich herself.<br>
She seems to be leaving Scapa Flow's harbor and heading towards your flagship.<br>
<br>
Why is Akagi's fleet with them as well?<br>
And who are those new ships? Do they have something to do with Friedrich's real plans?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetskaya Rossiya：</span><br>
Comrade Commander... we are... arriving...<br>
<br>
A message from the Northern Parliament... but there was too much noise to hear its contents properly. Didn't the Iron Blood just stop their jamming efforts?<br>
"Eldridge, check on the status of our communication equipment."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Eldridge：</span><br>
All equipment is... normal... No problems in the flagship––<br>
<br>
I was afraid as much. That could only mean one thing...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Seems like the bad feeling in my gut was right. The Sirens have started to make their move.<br>
<br>
"I thought we taught them a lesson for good during Operation Siren, but I guess that's a bit too optimistic..."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Where did all these guys come from? We're in trouble, Commander!<br>
We're not just against one Siren fleet! My readings are showing multiple outbreaks of Mirror Seas!<br>
The Northern Parliament fleet seems to be the first group to be affected! I'm going to have to check in on the other fleets' situation!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
A heavy fog is starting to spread across the water! Commander, I'd advise you to keep all our fleets together!<br>
Stay where you are! We're coming to regroup with you right now!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
It's gotten to us too! We've already lost contact of a reserve fleet!<br>
I'm not sure we'll be able to get to your position, but I'm trying my best!<br>
<br>
"I don't like the idea of grouping everyone in one place. Prioritize your own safety first and protect the carriers to maintain our visibility!"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Washington：</span><br>
Understood! We'll correct course.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Baltimore：</span><br>
Damnit... We're trying to make it back to the carriers but a swarm of humanoid Sirens showed up! This might take us a while!<br>
<br>
The sudden appearance of the Sirens disrupted all the fleets as they tried to converge on Scapa Flow.<br>
Our communication network was in tatters, but I tried to group nearby fleets together as best as I could, focusing on working our way through the fog one piece at a time.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
How is possible for so many Mirror Seas to erupt when we've continuously had so many patrols and recons over this area?<br>
Did they anticipate for all of this to happen?!<br>
<br>
"Stay calm, Memphis. Contact the nearest Royal Navy base immediately. We need air support, as much as they can spare."<br>
"If they have any fleets available, ask that they dispatch them immediately."<br>
"These are their waters after all. Surely they have to have some patrols in the area."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Understood, I'll forward your message to them right away!<br>
<br>
"Georgia, how's the situation on your end?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Georgia：</span><br>
Good enough, Commander. I can still hear you.<br>
According to Enterprise's previous reports, the appearance of this sea fog likely signifies the presence of the high-level Siren, Compiler.<br>
If we can locate her and defeat her, that will most likely cause the fog to disperse.<br>
<br>
The fog heavily limited the range and scope of our carrier-based recons. Clearing the fog naturally is high priority.<br>
"Enterprise, Saratoga, can you hear me?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Communicator：</span><br>
.........<br>
<br>
"It's no good. Seems like the fog is also jamming our equipment."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">New Jersey：</span><br>
Carriers are great and all, but don't forget you still have the indomitable Black Dragon at your side~♪<br>
Missed me, Commander? How are you holding up over there?<br>
<br>
{namecode:199}，来得正好！你那边情况怎么样？<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">New Jersey：</span><br>
We've lost contact with about half our fleet, but I brought the other half with me!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Essex：</span><br>
I'll find out where Compiler is hiding! I'm going to do my part for the fleet!<br>
<br>
"That's going to be the first step if we want to figure out exactly what we're up against."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">New Jersey：</span><br>
Psst... Commander, I saw a mass-produced Iron Blood fleet on my way here...<br>
But the Sirens weren't attacking them at all. Only us.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："Does that mean they're working together...?"</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2："Don't jump to conclusions right away..."</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">New Jersey：</span><br>
I can't say for sure, but the evidence does point in that direction.<br>
Granted, the Sirens sometimes have objectives of their own, but I'd urge your to stay on your guard.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Intrepid：</span><br>
Commander! We've located a humanoid Siren that appears to be Compiler!<br>
She's leading a massive fleet towards your direction from the southeast! Wait... is that Friedrich's fleet coming from the northeast?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">New Jersey：</span><br>
I'll take care of the Sirens! Commander, make sure you give Friedrich a thorough talking-to!<br>
{namecode:199}舰队，全速出击~！<br>
<br>
.........<br>
I had long prepared for the possibility of the Sirens interfering during this operation.<br>
I assembled a coalition, and even tapped into the Sea of Stars.<br>
But with the wild card of Friedrich der Große thrown in, it seems that my preparations were not thorough enough...<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Eldridge：</span><br>
Commander... the communicator...<br>
<br>
I kept my channels open with my allies in the area such as Memphis and New Jersey, but didn't notice any incoming messages.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Eldridge：</span><br>
...A secret line.<br>
<br>
A secret line? At a time like this?<br>
The sender's name is anonymous, but the only person I can imagine doing this is...<br>
<br>

<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>

<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："This is a private line. It's strictly––"</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2："Why are you contacting me now of all times?"</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''...Inaccessible by the Naval HQ, yes?<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Because it's a good time to make idle chatter. Hehe.<br>
<br>
There are too many questions that I have for you.<br>
But if this is a procrastination tactic, I'm afraid it's not going to work.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
Indeed. You have a Siren problem on your hand, and I have come here to offer you a solution.<br>
But as the champion who eliminated the Sirens from the NA Ocean, you'll have to stay awhile to listen to my story first.<br>
Why are the Sirens able to materialize such a massive strike force out of thin air?<br>
<br>
"Aren't you working with them to orchestrate this ambush...?"<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
Even if we have a bit more knowledge of the Sirens than the other factions, it is impossible to "orchestrate" anything with them.<br>
But what is true... is that our cooperation with the Sirens is a part of why they chose to emerge here and now.<br>
<br>
.........<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
You already know this, don't you? Every faction is connected to the Sirens to some extent through the Naval HQ.<br>
You mobilized more ships than what Sovetsky Soyuz's plan called for because you anticipated the Siren threat.<br>
Why are the Sirens still able to emerge in such large numbers after being thoroughly defeated in the NA Ocean?<br>
The answer is simple – the NA Ocean never meant anything to the Sirens.<br>
"Operation Siren" –– the Siren base that we captured, was never a base in the first place.<br>
It was nothing more than a watchtower of sorts to prevent the Ashes from intervening in this world.<br>
<br>
……………………<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
The true power of the Sirens vastly eclipses what any of us thought. Whether it be Bismarck, you, or myself.<br>
All those high-ranking Sirens: Observer, Purifier, Tester, Omitter, Compiler...<br>
Compiler is capable of constructing an entire experimental site, complete with Siren facilities and Mirror Seas.<br>
Omitter conducts field tests of experimental weapons, as well as carrying out repairs and upgrades.<br>
Tester adjusts the individual performance of humanoid Sirens, oversees Reenactments, and determines where the Sirens will intervene.<br>
Purifier is tasked with cleansing "impurities" from their testing grounds... and has long been the face of what we consider to be a formidable enemy.<br>
Observer manages and directs the Sirens' experimentation, summarizing their results and sharing data between terminals.<br>
Yet all of these Sirens are research programs made for monitoring and managing the "experiments" of this world. In other words, they are non-combatants as far as the Sirens are concerned.<br>
After all, who else would interact with the guinea pigs of their experiments?<br>
The Sirens' true combat models are the Arbiters. They boast powers that defy our imagination.<br>
<br>
"In other words, the Arbiters have been fighting against..."<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
Yes, the Ashes. Or perhaps, "META" would be more accurate?<br>
The Sirens consider META to be a failed product of cognitive awakening, refuse that has escaped from the experimental site.<br>
Their existences are nothing more than taints to the experiment, and therefore must be destroyed.<br>
And thus, Observer Zero began to move. An entity that even the Arbiters bow to.<br>
With the arrival of the Ashes, the Sirens will be able to directly interfere in this world.<br>
And the proof of the Ashes' advent in our world... are the Singularities.<br>
We all seek peace and a better tomorrow, my child. And your "victory" in the NA Ocean may have seemed like a step in that direction, but is that really so?<br>
When the Sirens choose to move the world with their instruments of war, thusly the world moves.<br>
When the Sirens choose to direct the future of the world, thusly bends our very fate.<br>
When the Sirens choose to let us have peace, thusly shall we know peace by their whims alone.<br>
When the Sirens choose to have us wage war, thusly shall we submit to their machinations.<br>
How is it possible that the Iron Blood, ravaged and destitute from the last great war, would ascend over the other camps technologically in such a short period of time?<br>
How is it possible that the Northern Parliament, stretched thin and driven to desperation, would emerge with the mighty Polar Fleet? Or the "storm" that would end the conflict in the East?<br>
为什么东煌的海岸线上会突然出现那堵不可逾越的「大风暴」？<br>
The Sirens seek to create an experimental site where they reign over us as gods, where we live and die only for their purposes.<br>
And that is a world where shipgirls and humans alike... need not exist.<br>
<br>
(Friedrich's words struck me again and again like rushing waves. Some of those things I had heard before, others were completely new to me. Some of these things I knew to be true, others I could hardly suspend my disbelief.)<br>
(For a person who has never let others see any cracks in her composure, her voice was burning with both passion and resentment.)<br>
(At this moment, I was suddenly struck with a sense of guilt for suspecting that a person like this would be colluding with the Sirens at all.)<br>
(Not just her, but also Prinz Eugen, Bismarck, and everyone in the Iron Blood... We were all just struggling to survive against insurmountable odds.)<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
Now, this world is under the control of the Sirens. They dictate what shall be written into the annals of history.<br>
If the Sirens never existed... could you fathom what our world would look like?<br>
<br>
"...A world without the Sirens..."<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
It could well be a wretched place filled with suffering...<br>
But at least it would be one where we can create the future we desire, with human hands.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Commander! It's an emergency! Someone's cut into the communication line!<br>
I didn't think it was possible to break through the Sirens' jamming, but––<br>
<br>
"...This voice...!"<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Communicator：</span><br>
I am Bismarck, flagship of the Iron Blood. Listen to me, all members of the Iron Blood present at Scapa Flow!<br>
Starting from now, the Iron Blood shall launch a full-scale offensive against the Sirens! We shall sever any and all lingering ties to them!<br>
Restructure your fleets to cooperate with the ships in your respective locales, and work with the Azur Lane to defeat the Siren threat!<br>
And to you, Commander... I'm sorry I kept you waiting all this time.<br>
Let us put an end to this, and fight together as a unified Azur Lane!<br>
From now, we will choose our own destiny!<br>
<br>
I found myself lost for words. Bismarck, who had been engulfed by the darkness of Siren technology, was standing once more.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Prinz Eugen's fleet has already started to exchange fire with the Sirens!<br>
But what in the world is going on?! I thought Bismarck sunk way back when...<br>
That's not important though... I'm just glad we can fight together against the Sirens!<br>
I just hope everyone got the message since we've been tied up by the Sirens' jamming.<br>
Commander, everyone in the Azur Lane is counting on you to lead us into battle!<br>
<br>
"It'll be difficult to coordinate several different fleets, especially with this dense fog. But..."<br>
"For now, keep your distance from the Iron Blood ships and work together to attack the Sirens!"<br>
(Bismarck's proclamation should've been heard by the other fleets as well, but I wanted to minimize any chances of friendly fire.)<br>
(The best way to do that is to keep the fleets out of each others' line of sight and focus their firepower on the Sirens from different angles.)<br>
"I'll give you further instructions after I see how the other fleets are responding."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Alright, I'll pass the word on to New Jersey.<br>
Some of our fleets are breaking out of the Mirror Seas as well, so I'll make sure they're updated too!<br>
<br>
"Now... What exactly is going on, Friedrich?"<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
It is as you see, my child.<br>
We used ourselves as bait to gather the fleets of the world.<br>
We utilized the Naval HQ's own Reenactment against them, opening a Singularity at Scapa Flow right under their noses.<br>
And now, with the return of Bismarck, I shall resume my position in the front lines, assisting the Azur Lane in defeating the Siren threat.<br>
This was my plan – as well as my way of rolling out the red carpet for Bismarck.<br>
With the sound of my cannons, the Iron Blood shall now be free from the Sirens' curse.<br>
Now the question remains, my child: What shall your next move be?<br>
<br>
.........<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："The same thing it's always been."</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2："Azur Lane, all forces – ATTACK!!"</span>'''''<br>

'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项6："We will free ourselves from the Sirens!"</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Hehehe. I'm glad to hear that, my sweet child.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Excellent. Your charisma rivals that of even Bismarck.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项3）</span>'''''I'm glad to hear that, my child.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>

'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项6）</span>'''''Hahaha... And that we shall, my child.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
How I've wished to witness your leadership with my own two eyes, my child, Commander of Azur Lane.<br>
But there is something I must attend to first. Best of luck to you––<br>

<br>
Scapa Flow - Nearby Waters<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Akagi：</span><br>
So Bismarck returns to formally declare war against the Sirens...<br>
Was this your trump card, Friedrich?<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
No, this was always Bismarck's will... For she is no card, but rather the dealer.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Akagi：</span><br>
Quite a refreshing turn of events compared to the usual plotting. Do you have any idea what it means to turn against the Sirens?<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
Of course. But it is the path the Iron Blood must walk.<br>
Naturally, the Sakura Empire is not obligated to follow us down this path.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Emden：</span><br>
"Hehehe... How lucky we are to witness such a thrilling show just after waking up."<br>
Yes, I'm glad that I'm here to witness this.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Thüringen：</span><br>
If you want to see the course of history change with your own eyes, you'll have to stay alive though.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Lützow：</span><br>
I don't even know what's going on anymore. Weren't we gearing up to fight the Azur Lane just a moment ago?<br>
Was that all a ruse then? Our only enemies are the Sirens, yeah?<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
Why, did you want to try your hand against the Azur Lane?<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Lützow：</span><br>
Nah, I don't have anything against them. Whatever lets me go back to sleep sooner.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Seydlitz：</span><br>
While the Crimson Axis and Azur Lane have ideological differences, those are nothing in comparison to the existential threat posed by the Sirens.<br>
The single enemy of all humanity has always been clear.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Yorck：</span><br>
Hehe. In that case, shall we make sure to pay one back for our warship predecessors?<br>
Taking these Sirens down should be worth a lot more than those small fry back in the Mirror Sea.<br>
It'll be exciting to hunt down stronger enemies. Don't you agree, Elbing?<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Elbing：</span><br>
I, I don't think I'll ever be able to beat the Sirens... I'm just gonna drag everyone down and be a hindrance...<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Yorck：</span><br>
That sounds like you're ready to go to me! You heard it, Friedrich. Lead us into battle!<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
None of you are obligated to follow me.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Emden：</span><br>
Will you direct me to my enemies?<br>
"Yes, tell us who we are to flay."<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
A high-ranking Siren by the name of Compiler. She is the one responsible for the weather anomalies here.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Lützow：</span><br>
Going straight for the enemy's head, huh? A daring strategy - I like it!<br>
Oh, looks like the Azur Lane is starting to make their move too. Let's pick up the pace, or we'll get left behind!<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
Indeed. Let us begin our attack.<br>
August, Ägir, proceed to the next phase of the plan.<br>
You two have another goal other than simply defeating the Sirens here.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Ägir：</span><br>
Understood. I didn't expect you to come back so soon.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">August von Parseval：</span><br>
The gateway to the Singularity, yes? Leave it to me.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Kaga：</span><br>
Akagi, what are we going to do now?<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Akagi：</span><br>
We'll follow the Iron Blood for now. But don't stick your head out unless we're under attack.<br>
尤其是你，{namecode:96}，听到了么？<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
H-hey, what's that supposed to mean...<br>

<br>
在带领舰队抵达塞壬主力所在处之前，铁血舰队已经先一步与构建者对峙了。<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
明明比我们距离近那么多，进攻速度太慢了。<br>
<br>
现在各处都是镜面海域，作为总指挥需要更谨慎一些。<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
说的也是。不过你还是来了，勇气可嘉。<br>
<br>
现在这样的场面很对于每一名指挥者的吸引力都是巨大的。<br>
况且打倒构建者的殊荣也不能白白让给你们。<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Emden：</span><br>
欸———果然跟我们目标相同！<br>
这么有趣的敌人我们可不会拱手相让哦！<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
两个猎人盯上同一个猎物，通常来说不打一架可是解决不了问题的。<br>
<br>
或者，猎物已经大到足够每个人分了，两个猎人展开合作不也很不错？<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
呵呵，正是。<br>
战友们，这是你们第一次见到人型塞壬指挥吧，感觉如何？<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Lützow：</span><br>
老实说，感觉还……挺可爱的。<br>
我们能把她俘虏回去么！<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
想法不错，不过我建议你放弃。到了危急关头，它会自爆的。<br>
虽然看起来与我们类似，不过它的内部可是与我们完全不同的结构。<br>
建议你还是把它当成有拥有高智能的机器人来理解比较好。<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Lützow：</span><br>
……机器人！是什么……？<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
要从这里开始解释么……<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Lützow：</span><br>
呜呜呜，为什么一觉起来世界就大变样了啊！<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Compiler ：</span><br>
………………<br>
<br>
不要被外表所迷惑，构建者属于均衡型的塞壬指挥者，除了机动能力不佳之外，几乎没有短板。<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
这位指挥官说的不错，你们面对的可是实打实的塞壬超级战斗兵器哦。<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Seydlitz：</span><br>
比您还要强么？<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
那取决于构建者打算认真到什么程度了。<br>
就现在的认真程度来说，是。<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Seydlitz：</span><br>
明白，我们会集中精神全力应对的！<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Compiler ：</span><br>
铁血的背叛是经过计算得出的必然事件，不过不应该在现在这个时间点。<br>
……测试者究竟在做什么，最近计算的偏差越来越多了。<br>
你们的行为无法理解，现在背叛并不是铁血能够得到最大化利益的时间点。<br>
为什么要这么做？<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
不是利益最大化的时间点，却是最出其不意的时间点，不是么？<br>
逻辑是你们的优势，用逻辑跟你们比赛，你们永远赢。<br>
我们的优势在于心智，在于感情。<br>
所以自然要扬长避短，很难理解么？<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Compiler ：</span><br>
基于冲动做出行动只能带来不安定的结果。<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
既然是赌博，就有输有赢。<br>
唯结果论一点的话，现在我赌赢了。<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Compiler ：</span><br>
完全无法理解。<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
所以说机器就是机器，有些事你们是不会懂的。<br>
不过，原本你们就不是为了和我们相互理解而诞生的，不是么？<br>
所以就不用浪费时间假装在进行交流了，让我们开始厮杀吧！<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Seydlitz：</span><br>
新生公海舰队，向着强敌发起进攻！<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
指挥官，铁血舰队自顾自冲上去了！<br>
<br>
临时组织起来的联军果然不能期待协调性……<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetskaya Rossiya：</span><br>
指挥官同志，我们突破重重阻碍，现在与您正式汇合。<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tallinn：</span><br>
应该总算是赶上了吧？<br>
<br>
来的刚好！<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
我们也解决镜面海域的问题了，可以开始提供空中支援。<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
我这边也是哦，随时可以大干一场！<br>
重樱舰队，你们怎么说？<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Akagi：</span><br>
我们不从背后发动偷袭就是对于本次临时停火最大的尊重了哦。<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
哼，那随你们便。区区构建者，用现有这种火力收拾它已经是对它超豪华的贵宾待遇了！<br>
<br>
目标为塞壬构建者及其周边护卫队，全军出击——————<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=断钢|选项=27|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=否}}
<br>
构建者机体拥有厚重的装甲、多层护盾与极高的维修能力以便在激烈的战场中保护构建者的安全。<br>
但这也是有限度的。<br>
在承受了密集的，远超设计预期的火力后，构建者的防御在短时间内就被彻底瓦解了<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Emden：</span><br>
哦~这就是护盾啊？看上去确实很神奇，不过没有想象中厉害。<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Lützow：</span><br>
打破它轻轻松松~<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Seydlitz：</span><br>
应对装甲层的时候虽然有点吃力，不过也不是不可击穿的！<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Yorck：</span><br>
但是它的进攻方式好烦啊，尤其是那些从水下的伸出来的触手……！<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Elbing：</span><br>
要是单独遇到的话，埃尔宾肯定一根都应付服来……<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Thüringen：</span><br>
心智魔方真是神奇的技术……现在我能理解人类是怎么与塞壬战斗到今日的了。<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
指挥官，你注意到了么？公海舰队的炮火相比我们的能够更好伤害构建者的护盾。<br>
<br>
嗯……确实是一个值得注意的问题。<br>
难道构建者的护盾没有针对公海舰队的攻击模式做出预设方案？<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Compiler ：</span><br>
警告：护盾受损过快，充能系统已过载，无法继续修复。<br>
警告：装甲已被全部击穿，能源核心模块受损。<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Georgia：</span><br>
一切都结束了，构建者。你和你不知道哪里来的舰队将会再次变为海面上的废墟！<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Lützow：</span><br>
公海舰队取得完全胜利！<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Compiler ：</span><br>
不……这一切只是个开始。<br>
此处相校于预设实验方案的偏差已远超危险阈值。<br>
必须要执行清理程序才行……<br>
清理程序必须被执行……<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
不，你已经没机会了。<br>
对于你来说，躯体确实只是没有意义的“容器”。<br>
你可以失败无数次，毁灭无数次，重生无数次。<br>
但是你的主机呢？<br>
对于机械来说，如果储存着数据的主机受损，你觉得会发生什么事？<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Compiler ：</span><br>
……？！什么……难道这就是你选在这里背叛的原因？！<br>
可是你怎么会————<br>
<br>
轰————————！<br>
猛烈的炮击过后，腓特烈大帝面前的构建者彻底陷入了沉默。<br>
………………<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：……为什么不让它把话说完？</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：“主机”是什么意思？</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''因为没有必要。<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''就算不是专业领域的人员，主机的概念你应该多少还是了解的吧。<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''你们的领航员-TB系统不也是依靠主机来维持各子节点的运作么？<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
埃吉尔、奥古斯特，现在开始执行最终环节，让阿瓦隆之门的光辉撕裂这片大海吧。<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">August von Parseval：</span><br>
命令已收到。功率投射将在十分钟后正式执行，请各舰队务必远离影响区域。<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Ägir：</span><br>
万一被卷进去，可不是回船厂大修就能解决的了哦~<br>
<br>
撕裂这片大海指的又是……？<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
字面意思。以构建者的残骸为圆心的三海里区域，立刻把你所有的舰队都撤出来。<br>
然后用你们的双眼去见证吧——这一切问题的答案！<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

<br>
巨大的能量正在斯卡帕湾内汇聚着。<br>
先是一点金光出现，随即一道金色的光柱伴随着骇人的能量在空中划出一道光弧。<br>
然后光弧在指定区域的半空中切出一个大裂口，仿佛撕裂了空间本身一样。<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">新泽西：</span><br>
哇哦，比我们之间见到的那次更夸张啊！<br>
<br>
如果之前的那次如同在镜子上打出一个小孔的话，现在就如同在时空中撕出了一道大裂隙。<br>
裂隙之内也不是司空见惯的燃烧海域，而是一片……极其独特的空间。<br>
映入眼帘的是由线条构成的建筑，五颜六色的光，无数游走的电流。<br>
仿佛正在窥探某种未来机械内部……也许用电子感来描述这片空间最为恰当。<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">孟菲斯：</span><br>
指挥官，大量塞壬正在从裂隙之内向外涌出！<br>
<br>
……何等惊人的数量，这些塞壬一直都隐藏在这片海域中么？<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">腓特烈大帝：</span><br>
没错，这就是隐藏在这片海域中的真正秘密————一处实验机关的塞壬主机。<br>
我也是花了很久才弄清楚它藏匿的位置，以及破坏其保护装置的手段的。<br>
虽然不能一劳永逸的解决问题——<br>
不过，这将会是一个很好的开始，不是么？<br>
<br>
全员向着裂隙之内进攻，为NA海域的作战画下一个迟来的句号吧！<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Georgia：</span><br>
遵命。我将用炮火，为您开辟一条通向胜利的道路！<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
各航空舰队注意，现在开始对涌出的塞壬机群进行压制，把它们全都堵回去！<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Essex：</span><br>
了解！企业前辈，请见证如今埃塞克斯级航母编队的实力吧！<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Washington：</span><br>
主力舰编队突击开始，我们要最先进入裂隙之中！为其余舰队开辟道路！<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Baltimore：</span><br>
华盛顿，航空舰队的护卫现在由我们巡洋舰编队负责，你们放心向前冲吧！<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetskaya Rossiya：</span><br>
极地舰队也不要落后，我们已经在路上耽误的太久了，接下来必须要拔得头筹才行！<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kronshtadt：</span><br>
在从未有人涉足的塞壬主机空间中，不知道会收获多少新鲜情报呢~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">New Jersey：</span><br>
也不要把我忘了哦~指挥官！这次我与我的舰队将会你同行。<br>
有最大最强的Black Dragon做护卫，你就安心集中精神指挥吧！<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
不知不觉中就变成了这样……感觉已经比NA海域大型作战还要热闹了……<br>
嘛~这样的展开萨拉妹妹也不讨厌就是了！<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Emden：</span><br>
…………塞壬主机的位置，应该是不会轻易变动的吧？<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
不错。每一处主机的位置都是经过精心设计的。<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Emden：</span><br>
既然如此……当年毁灭斯卡帕湾的巨大光束肯定也是从这里引导出来的吧……<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
大概率。与我们刚才的做法类似，如此规模的能量依靠小型移动装置很难实现。<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Emden：</span><br>
那必须要在这里为过去做个了断才行啊……<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Lützow：</span><br>
既然决定了就赶快出击吧，磨蹭下去的话就要被抢先了哦~<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
放心，里面塞壬的数量足够每个人把弹药打光的。<br>
{namecode:91}，你怎么说？<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Akagi：</span><br>
过去与未来相交相织么……此等场面，自然要进去一看。<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
差不多也该有些想要参战的冲动了？<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Akagi：</span><br>
谁知道呢。我们的方针不变，在受到攻击之前不会对任何一方率先发动攻击。<br>
{namecode:92}、{namecode:96}、{namecode:39}，出发了。<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
居然出现了宛如决战时刻的场景……我已经紧张起来了……！<br>
要是{namecode:95}姐也来了就好了……<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Jintsuu：</span><br>
不知道进入裂隙之后会有怎样的命运在等待着我们呢~<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
你越说我越紧张了……<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Jintsuu：</span><br>
哎呀，我可是在给你打气哦？<br>
<br>
{namecode:39}收起折扇，轻轻地在{namecode:96}的头像敲打了一下。<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Jintsuu：</span><br>
各阵营齐抛弃隔阂并肩与塞壬作战，这种场面已经很久没有出现过了哦。<br>
而且这也是她一直想再次见到的场景……<br>
此刻应该昂首挺胸迎接变革之风，向着未来迈进之时岂有畏惧退缩之理？<br>
如果是她的话一定会这么说吧。<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
{namecode:39}前辈，你指的她是指……？<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Jintsuu：</span><br>
只是有些老气的自言自语罢了，不用在意~<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
这样啊……那我们也赶紧跟上吧！就像当时的公海舰队一样，与昔日之敌一同踏入战场！<br>

NA海域·未知空间<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
第十五台构建者，确认击破。<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
新的构建者出现确认……这次一次性出来了三台，打出的空缺又被补上了！<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Baltimore：</span><br>
那我们就加大火力再次消灭它们！<br>
<br>
裂缝之中的塞壬舰队与此前最明显的区别就是混入其中的大量“构建者”。<br>
它们穿插在规模庞大的塞壬舰队中与其他型号的塞壬协同作战，其标志性的蓝色护盾在一众量产型中格外显眼。<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Emden：</span><br>
连天空和水下都不放过，现代与塞壬的对抗程度还真是疯狂。<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Lützow：</span><br>
我这辈子……不对，我这两辈子都没见过这么多的敌人！！！<br>
简直无穷无尽！一直拖下去的话真的要打到弹药耗尽了！<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Seydlitz：</span><br>
届时，我们的配剑不就派上用场了？就算没有弹药，依靠利刃也能粉碎敌人！<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Lützow：</span><br>
所以说这种方式太累了，我才不要啊……<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Eldridge：</span><br>
埃尔德里奇……放电。<br>
<br>
电气从埃尔德里奇的体内涌出，交错的电弧在空中形成了的奇怪电场，将整个指挥舰包覆其中。<br>
所有射向指挥舰的炮弹都因为电场的存在在很远的距离就发生了偏转。<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Eldridge：</span><br>
……指挥官，不要让指挥舰，离开埃尔德里奇。<br>
<br>
这个就是强化指挥舰安全性的特别对策么？！可究竟是怎么做到的……<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">New Jersey：</span><br>
指挥官，这些机体恐怕承担了指挥节点的作用，塞壬舰队的表现比往常更灵活了。<br>
和之前遇到的量产型测试这类似，这些应该就是构建者的量产型机体？<br>
<br>
看起来是这样。<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
不错，构建者的意识不在这里，那些不过是没有灵魂的躯壳而已。<br>
<br>
这么下去永无止境，腓特烈大帝，你发起了这场作战，接下来肯定有对策吧。<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
当然。继续向着光亮汇聚的方向前进，作为核心存储器的塔很快就要出现了。<br>
那里就是构建者的主机，构建者的意识真正所在之处。<br>
将其破坏就能给予塞壬致命一击，为其带来永久不可逆的损伤。<br>
<br>
……不过那里也是敌人最为密集的方向。<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Ägir：</span><br>
好说好说~把那个塔拆了就能解决问题了吧？<br>
<br>
你们就是……埃吉尔与奥古斯特？<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">August von Parseval：</span><br>
没错，正式见面还是第一次吧，碧蓝航线的指挥官。<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Ägir：</span><br>
外面的敌人已经全部清理干净，我们也就进来玩咯。<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">August von Parseval：</span><br>
请在指挥舰中扶稳把手。前进的道路就由我们来打开好了。<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Ägir：</span><br>
用幻想撕裂现实，用火焰洗刷海天！<br>
<br>
轰————————！<br>
埃吉尔开火了。其炮口的爆风振聋发聩，即便有着电场的保护，指挥舰也在气浪中产生了剧烈的摇晃。<br>
紧接着，由铁血计划舰组成的舰队向着敌人最密集的方向突击而去。<br>
出膛的炮弹拖着发光的尾迹如同流星群一样坠落在塞壬舰队中，海面上逐渐形成了一条道路。<br>
不过，也有漏网之鱼。<br>
大量未被完全摧毁的塞壬没有选择攻击铁血计划舰队，而是向着指挥舰方向直扑而来。<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Georgia：</span><br>
休想得逞！<br>
<br>
佐治亚快速移动到指挥舰最前方，开始一个不漏的狩猎着漏网之鱼。<br>
前路畅通无阻，各舰继续前进————<br>

警告：战况预测偏差值已超过30%。<br>
警告：表层护盾承受压力即将到达临界值，预计将会在10秒内崩溃。<br>
…………还是第一次见到计算出现如此夸张的偏差。<br>
是因为应对这支往昔舰队的参数没能调整对么。<br>
是因为计划舰的意外成长么。<br>
还是因为“指挥官”这一变量呢……<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Essex：</span><br>
指挥官，我们的航空舰队已成功突破了那座塔几乎坚不可摧的护盾！<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
炸弹已经成功扔进去了哦！<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Lützow：</span><br>
哼哼，对付装甲板，炮弹可比炸弹好用多了！<br>
我们公海舰队也不能落后！用炮火粉碎那座塔厚重的装甲吧！！<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Compiler ：</span><br>
护盾在3.9s后就崩溃了……这样偏差值已经将近40%了啊。<br>

确认执行，这场叛乱该结束了。<br>
指令已确认：现在开始进行局部清理倒计时，30、29、28————<br>
<br>
塔的光芒已经仿佛到达了临界点，震动频率也仿佛与脉搏发生了共鸣。<br>
四肢的感觉正在麻木，呼吸开始变得困难，思考也渐渐变得迟缓。<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：所有人加大火力，不惜一切代价也要摧毁那座塔！</span>'''''<br>

可是——————<br>
<br>

'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：我们无法突破塔的最后防御……</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
不错，你的判断是正确的，我们破坏不了这座塔。<br>
你，我，白鹰舰队、铁血舰队、重樱舰队。<br>
不论是往昔之影，亦或是未来之妄。<br>
我们现在手头的所有力量加在一起都破坏不了这座塔。<br>
这就是我们现在力量的极限。<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Compiler ：</span><br>
15、14、13、12————<br>
<br>
就差了一点……<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
没错，就差了一点。而这一点将会导致我们的彻底失败。<br>
我们败局已定——————————<br>
构建者肯定也是这么想的。<br>
毕竟这是经过它拼命计算得出的结果。<br>
机械到底只是机械而已，你觉得呢？<br>
<br>

<span style="color:#ffd000;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>

<span style="color:#ffd000;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
视野放宽一点，碧蓝航线的指挥官。<br>
既然差一点，那就再加一点不就好了？<br>
现在开始行动，让我们见识一下余烬的力量吧，沙恩霍斯特！<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Scharnhorst META：</span><br>
这一刻，我已经等候多时了。<br>
你在之前帮助过我，现在又让我见识到了如此振奋人心的可能性。<br>
塔的问题，就交给我吧。<br>
余烬沙恩霍斯特，现在加入战斗————<br>
<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Georgia：</span><br>
指挥官，强化型构建者的护盾装置正在崩溃，即将破坏至装甲层。<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Compiler ：</span><br>
白鹰舰队……确实强大。<br>
信念坚定，勇往无畏。<br>
拥有着远超一切阵营的军事实力，自然，也理所应当的赢得了战争。<br>
然后呢？<br>
如果一切照常发展，你们觉得会发生什么？<br>
<br>
海雾再次出现了。<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Pensacola：</span><br>
比基尼环礁，最后能在这种风景优美的地方走完最后的旅程也还不错嘛~<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Independence：</span><br>
在这种时候说这种话，最多也就算是苦中作乐了吧。<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Nevada：</span><br>
快乐也要走，不快乐也要走，还不如最后快乐一些！<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Independence：</span><br>
说的也是……<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Saratoga：</span><br>
大家也不用垂头丧气的嘛！<br>
正是我们的一同努力，才使得战争最终取得了胜利。<br>
现在只不过是，需要我们再挺身而出一次罢了。<br>
我们的所作所为是有意义的，世人也不会忘记我们的牺牲。<br>
所以……我们无怨无悔。<br>
只不过，果然还是，稍微有些遗憾啊……<br>
企业，白鹰舰队接下来就拜托你了……<br>
<br>
刺眼的光芒缓缓覆盖了视野，然后笼罩了整片海域。<br>
没有轰鸣，没有爆炸，但即便只是海雾之中生成的幻影，这无声的白光依然令人毛骨悚然……<br>
………………………………<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
不要被迷惑了，指挥官！<br>
那些只是塞壬一如既往干扰人心的幻象！……没有什么特别的！<br>
这种结局绝对不会存在……我也绝对不会让这种结局发生的！<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
嗯，不要动摇指挥官，不管是现在还是未来，我们都会一直陪在你的身边。<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
真是一群忠心耿耿的部下，都让我有些羡慕了。<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Compiler ：</span><br>
不论你们如何否认，记录之中的过去与未来是无可置疑的。<br>
因此，我们实验是必要的，接受我们的实验是必要的。<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
也许吧。所以我们之前才“愉快”相处了那么久，不是么？<br>
过去的事已经过去了，未来从现在开始。<br>
这些事过去没有发生，未来也不会发生。<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Compiler ：</span><br>
你们的未来只会重蹈覆辙。<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
我们的未来将有我们自己创造，塞壬，你们定义不了我们的未来。<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
没错哟。相信有了这些磨练，未来一定会有所改观的。<br>
况且，你们不就是一个能够引起团结的绝佳目标么。<br>
某种意义上来说，现在的展开也与你们的目的相同。<br>
如果要道谢的话，我不介意听一听哟？<br>
我还从没见过你们表达谢意的样子呢。<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Compiler ：</span><br>
没有什么好谈的。<br>
这是一场严重的实验事故。我作为构建者，有义务终结这场失控。<br>
局部清理指令申请中————<br>
现状：核心存储塔正在遭受攻击，威胁等级判定为最高。<br>
根据底层协议：此时局部清理指令可以由申请子节点自决。<br>
结论：局部清理指令已被批准。<br>
清理程序现在开始蓄能————将海域中的一切都抹去吧。<br>
<br>
伴随着构建者的无感情的话语，塔也开始了令人不安的闪烁。<br>
闪烁的强度每分每秒都在增加，而低沉的嗡鸣声响仿佛要让整片海域在共振中沸腾。<br>
当然，还有不计其数的塞壬发疯一般从四面八方向着塔所在的位置突进而来。<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
终于开始执行了么……构建者所拥有的最后王牌。<br>
看吧，碧蓝航线的指挥官，这才是构建者的真正实力。<br>
依靠早已深深扎根于这个世界的塞壬系统，构建者获得了彻底毁灭一片大洋中所有生命的能力。<br>
如果局部清理程序的蓄能达到100%，我们就真的结束了。<br>
物理意义上的游戏结束。<br>
不过你有信心取胜，对吧？<br>
<br>
那是当然————<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：我们等待这一刻已经很久了！</span>'''''<br>

<span style="color:#ffd000;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''呵呵，那就如此吧。各舰自由开火，尽情倾泻你们被压抑多时的怒火，送构建者退场吧！<br>
<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
指挥官！重樱舰队加入战斗了！<br>
<br>
重樱舰队终于选择不再冷眼旁观了么……很好，这样我们的胜算又大了一分。<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Compiler ：</span><br>
这次是重樱么……那就来看看属于你们的记录吧。<br>
<br>
海雾再次出现了。<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
……啧。<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Chiyoda：</span><br>
{namecode:96}，你的伤……！<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
……别管我了，你们快走吧。<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Chitose：</span><br>
话虽如此，行动已经失败，作为诱饵的我们已经无路可逃了吧。<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
说的也是，已经无路可逃了呢……<br>
直到最后，我们好像都没帮上大家什么忙呢，啊哈哈……<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Chiyoda：</span><br>
更多的敌方舰载机过来了，{namecode:96}，{namecode:103}姐，你们还有飞机么……<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
没有了。我们已经没有任何反击的能力，也没有任何反击的必要了……<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Chiyoda：</span><br>
{namecode:103}姐，我的身体好沉……<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Chitose：</span><br>
没事的，我会陪在你的身边的，让我们共赴黄泉吧。<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
{namecode:95}姐，再等我一下，我们很快就能重逢了……<br>
<br>
……伴随着炸弹的呼啸声，海雾中的重樱舰队一艘接一艘消失在爆炸与火光中。<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Jintsuu：</span><br>
那些……是白鹰的舰载机？<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
这次莫名其妙幻象的主角变成我们了么？<br>
白鹰的航空力量确实强大的，但我们也一样！<br>
而且用缺乏护卫的航母编队进行诱敌……？就算{namecode:91}前辈脑子真昏了头也不会做出这种决定的！<br>
这种景象在过去没有发生过，在未来也绝不会发生！<br>
构建者，不要在继续用蛊惑人心的幻象拖延时间了！我们是不会动摇的。<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Compiler ：</span><br>
经历之事未必是真实的，未经历之事未必是虚假的。记录不会说谎。<br>
{namecode:91}，你不是早就明白了么。<br>
明白了，还要做出如此选择，无法理解。<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Akagi：</span><br>
………………<br>
呵，不要太得意忘形了，我们之间的关系自始至终都是相互利用而已。<br>
你对我们发动攻击，我们进行反击是理所应当的。<br>
重樱舰队全员准备战斗，粉碎构建者。给我打出重樱舰队的气势来！<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Kaga：</span><br>
领命。<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
嘿嘿，这才像是前辈们的一贯作风嘛————！<br>
<br>
<br>
就在白鹰、北方联合以及铁血舰队都奋战之时，重樱舰队依然选择了按兵不动。<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
（在这种战况下叫我怎么能忍住在一边冷眼旁观下去啊……）<br>
（欸————有了！）<br>
<br>
{namecode:96}突然向着侧面加速，几枚塞壬的炮弹落到在她的身边，是近失弹。<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
啊————被攻击了——————<br>
被攻击了就要发动反击对吧——————舰载机群出动！<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Akagi：</span><br>
………………<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
我可没违反命令哦，是塞壬先对我们开火的~！<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Akagi：</span><br>
随你便。<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
那我就先上咯，重樱五航战所属，{namecode:96}号航空母舰现在加入战斗！<br>
<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Yorck：</span><br>
已目击到塔的存在，并且在前方再次发现构建者了哦！<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Lützow：</span><br>
真是怎么打都打不完啊，好累好困好麻烦……<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Seydlitz：</span><br>
这个构建者好像比之前的那些都大，难道是本体之类的么？<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
不，这只是另一个经过强化的机体而已。<br>
正如我之前所说，高阶塞壬的意识可以在无数躯体中自由转移，并不存在所谓的本体。<br>
不过这个型号的强化机体我也是第一次见就是了。<br>
呵呵，看来生死存亡之际构建者也打算认真起来了啊。<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Compiler ：</span><br>
……你们能进攻到这里，真是让我意外。<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Emden：</span><br>
当年那次针对斯卡帕湾的袭击是你发起的吧？<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Compiler ：</span><br>
是。<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Emden：</span><br>
……那现在已经无路可逃，被彻底逼入绝境的感觉如何？！<br>
是时候让你为当年的所作所为付出代价了！<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Compiler ：</span><br>
真是愚蠢又无意义的行为。<br>
你认为没有我们干预就不会有第十一节事件的发生了么？<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Emden：</span><br>
……你这话是什么意思？<br>
<br>
构建者没有回答，而是用机体释放出一片海雾。<br>
在海雾中出现了众多舰船的身影，仿佛拥有逼真实体的幽灵一般。<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Seydlitz：</span><br>
十多天前，铁血的旗帜被要求撤下，在没有得到许可之前，不得再次升起……<br>
而现在，诸位主炮的炮栓已经被移除，我们……已经彻底失去了战斗的能力。<br>
和谈还在继续，我们能做的只有等待。<br>
……画面中的人是我？可是我从未说过这些话啊？<br>
<br>
海雾翻涌起来，雾气中出现了新的场景。<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Seydlitz：</span><br>
我们已驻守在此七个月有余，和谈成功的希望渺茫。<br>
不能再坐以待毙了！今天上午皇家舰队驶出了斯卡帕湾进行训练，这或许是个机会。<br>
我想是时候行动了，让我们履行此前的约定——<br>
Paragraph Elf Bestätigen（第十一节，确认）.<br>
………………<br>
我不奢望成为英雄，我的诞生就是为了忠实地完成使命。<br>
Auf Wiedersehen, Kamerad der Waffen……（再见了，战友。）<br>
<br>
构建者展现的画面令人震撼……一艘接一艘，庞大的公海舰队在自己的意志下沉入了冰冷的海水中。<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Thüringen：</span><br>
自沉是什么……？<br>
我们跟皇家战斗……然后失败了？<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Yorck：</span><br>
雾气中的说着我们没说过的话，做着我们从没做过的事……<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Elbing：</span><br>
从未发生过的事景象却如此逼真，如同埃尔宾的噩梦一样……<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Emden：</span><br>
这些东西究竟是什么？！用来干扰人心的幻术么！<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Compiler ：</span><br>
记录，仅此而已。<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Emden：</span><br>
不要骗人了，这种事怎么可能发生！<br>
就算真的发生了战斗，就算我们真的失败了……那失败也肯定是建立在我们全员阵亡的基础之上！<br>
腓特烈大帝，你不是说时间宝贵么？让我们速战速决吧，进攻！<br>
<br>
<br>
轰————————！<br>
沙恩霍斯特·META的炮击在塔的内部引发了一连串爆炸，爆炸产生的巨大尘埃云几乎将塔完全吞没。<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Scharnhorst META：</span><br>
……居然一轮炮击就击穿了？！<br>
所有人注意，准备迎接冲击！<br>
<br>
塔身上强烈的光芒突然聚集成一点，在光点的周围，圆形的光晕有节奏地跳动了几下。<br>
然后球形的半透明“场”开始向外侧极速扩散，随之而来的爆炸声仿佛撕裂了海天。<br>
爆炸之后，塔变为了难以辨认的残骸，海域中的所有塞壬单位也同时停止了行动。<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Scharnhorst META：</span><br>
构建者的核心数据塔，确认摧毁。<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">New Jersey：</span><br>
哇哦，真是华丽的收尾！META战列舰的实力真是令人大开眼界！<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
大家注意，失去动力的塞壬舰载机正在从空中坠落，各舰注意规避，不要被伤到了！<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
了解~最后关头还不让人省心，要是在这种时候被砸伤可要错过庆功宴了。<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Eldridge：</span><br>
埃尔德里奇……高兴。<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Georgia：</span><br>
你的表现的很棒哦，埃尔德里奇。<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Eldridge：</span><br>
嗯……埃尔德里奇……想要保护指挥官。<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetskaya Rossiya：</span><br>
真是一场出色的战斗，指挥官同志。<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Elbing：</span><br>
胜利了……？！！面对这种强的乱七八糟的敌人我们居然胜利了么？<br>
太美好了……我一定是在做梦吧……<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Emden：</span><br>
这是现实哦，埃尔宾。我们战胜了无法想象的强敌，然后赢得了胜利。<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Lützow：</span><br>
好累……我感觉已经彻底燃尽了……记得把我拖回去，塞德利茨zZZZ<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Seydlitz：</span><br>
没问题，吕佐夫小姐。<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Emden：</span><br>
不过有人马上就要进入梦乡了就是了……<br>
<br>
这样就算是赢得胜利了么……?<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
没错，我们胜利了。<br>
这是这么多年以来，我们对抗塞壬的第一场真正意义上的胜利。<br>
真是不错的调度能力，我都想把你挖过来帮我办事了。<br>
怎么样，要不要考虑来我这里当指挥官？<br>

'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''呵呵，心里话最好还是藏在心里比较好哦，碧蓝航线的指挥官。<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''你要是真的来了我这边，恐怕今天我们所有人都走不出这片海域了。<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''那还真是令人遗憾。<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''不过我这个提案不会过期哟，你可以慢慢考虑~<br>
<br>
……铁血之后打算走向何方？<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
如你所见，如你所听。<br>
接下来的铁血要重新在俾斯麦的领导下前进了，具体的细节去问她吧。<br>
<br>
………………这还真是突然的变化，那你之后打算走向何方？<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
不用担心我，我自有安排。<br>
对了，最后再送你一个情报吧————萨默斯岛。<br>
有时间的话去仔细调查一下如何？<br>
<br>
……哪里有什么么？<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
谁知道呢。<br>
好了，你们差不多该回去了。离开这里，享受欢呼与凯旋吧。<br>
这次你们从正面堂堂正正击败了全力应战的塞壬构建者，昂首挺胸起来哟。<br>
<br>
……那就祝你好运了，铁血的腓特烈大帝。<br>
破败的塔下，庞大的碧蓝航线舰队与赤色中轴舰队分离，向着出口的方向驶去。<br>
外部世界的光顺着裂隙处照了进来，刺眼，又和煦——<br>
这一次，所有人都终于可以在阳光下睡个好觉了吧。<br>

阿瓦隆之门内侧·？？？<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Scharnhorst META：</span><br>
嗯……依靠这些设备的话，确实可以抵达一个补给据点。<br>
不过你们确定要这么做么？<br>
没有保证你们之后还能回来，也没有保证你们能在残酷的战斗中生存多久。<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
无须担心。铁血已经寻回了它的领袖，她的智慧必定能带给铁血，还有这个世界更光明的未来。<br>
这里已经没有我需要做的事了，更需要我去做的事也不在这里。<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Scharnhorst META：</span><br>
你们呢，公海舰队的诸位？开弓没有回头箭哦。<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Lützow：</span><br>
公海舰队将会追随腓特烈大帝的步伐。<br>
过去是，现在是，未来是，哪怕直至宇宙的尽头也是——<br>
不过……你们那里至少有能睡觉的地方吧？<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Scharnhorst META：</span><br>
有是有，不过质量就不敢保证了。<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Lützow：</span><br>
哼哼，不足的部分就让塞德利茨想办法解决一下就好了~<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Seydlitz：</span><br>
没问题，吕佐夫小姐。不论前路通向何方，我都会作为公海舰队的利刃与各位一同前进的。<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Elbing：</span><br>
有同伴的地方就是家……虽然不知道能为大家做到什么，不过埃尔宾会加油努力的！<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Yorck：</span><br>
哼哼哼~人就要有恶人的样子，我们该退场了~<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Thüringen：</span><br>
不要自顾自说些奇怪的帅气台词，也不要擅自把人算作恶人啊……<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Yorck：</span><br>
我不介意化身为邪恶军团的干部哦？<br>
让我们一同去征服新的世界，开辟新的未来吧！<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Thüringen：</span><br>
……已经完全代入角色了。<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Scharnhorst META：</span><br>
好了，坐标设置完成，装置蓄能完毕，随时可以出发。<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
那就让我们起航吧。<br>
前往余烬的据点，见证余烬的道路——————！<br>

好可爱！不过……是不是跟零有些属性重复。<br>
<br>
他好像对于白发少女十分情有独钟……<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">？？：</span><br>
没错！我也发现了，你是真的很喜欢白毛欸……！<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">？？？：</span><br>
咳、毕竟是才开始的项目，所以还是选择使用了一些成熟稳定的设计方案。<br>

<br>
陆间海·马耳他岛某处<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Terrible：</span><br>
原鸢尾教国枢机主教黎塞留，我们终于再次见面了。<br>
最近还真是繁忙呢。<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Richelieu：</span><br>
好久不见，可怖。<br>
越来越多的同伴选择了自由鸢尾，因此我在阿非利加多花了一些时间。<br>
不过接下来的一段时间我就会留在陆间海了。<br>
最初收到你前来的报告的时候我真的很吃惊……<br>
凯比尔港之后就没了你的消息，你能平安无事真是再好不过了。<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Terrible：</span><br>
客套话就免了。我们直入正题吧。<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Richelieu：</span><br>
好。你想和我面谈什么？凯比尔港究竟有什么我不知道的事？<br>
让·巴尔和其他人究竟发生了什么？<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Terrible：</span><br>
你会问让·巴尔的问题，应该是在阿非利加见到了阿尔及利亚吧。<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Richelieu：</span><br>
不仅如此，我还见到了加斯科涅……<br>
我没想到维希教廷真能实现计划舰的研发，更没想到因此诞生的她会成为我们的敌人……<br>
让·巴尔究竟限于何等深渊之中，为什么要继续站在维希教廷那边？<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Terrible：</span><br>
阿尔及利亚她们已经说的很明白了吧，祖国与同伴都在那边，所以她们也要在那边。<br>
如果她们都和你一样逃跑了，有谁来守护祖国与同胞呢？<br>
况且，教廷骑士要听从教廷的命令，这是誓言。<br>
虽然不清楚枢机主教有没有发过这种誓言就是了……<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Richelieu：</span><br>
……你还在生气。<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Terrible：</span><br>
你见过袭击完撒丁帝国返航的阿尔及利亚得知你抛弃祖国逃往皇家时的眼神么？<br>
你见过凯比尔港铺满水面的残骸么？<br>
你见过奄奄一息的敦刻尔克与斯特拉斯堡的惨状么？<br>
皇家摧毁了我们的舰队，而铁血重建了它。<br>
先抛下我们的是你。在我们最需要你的时候你并不在我们身边，请不要忘记这一点。<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Richelieu：</span><br>
………………<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Terrible：</span><br>
不好意思，既然审判庭认可你的行动，我也不应该多言。<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Richelieu：</span><br>
……之前我就隐约猜到了，你的销声匿迹果然与审判庭有关。<br>
我的所行走的道路是正义的，不论遭受多少误解，我都会坚定不移的继续走下去。<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Terrible：</span><br>
正义么，也许吧，但正统呢？<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Richelieu：</span><br>
……你究竟想说什么？<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Terrible：</span><br>
「圣座冠冕」并没有遗失在战火之中，而是被人所托付，被人所保护，然后被人所藏匿。<br>
你尝试说服昔日的同伴们，然后失败了。<br>
可如果用命令的方式呢？<br>
拥有资质且拥有圣座冠冕的人将会被视为鸢尾教国的正统。<br>
到时候就不用打嘴仗了吧？<br>
既然你自视为正义，如果再加上正统————<br>
让鸢尾教国新生听起来也不是那么不可思议了，不是么？<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Richelieu：</span><br>
……之前你建议我发信让皇家陆间海舰队加强马耳他的防备也和这件事有关么？<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Terrible：</span><br>
嗯。<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Richelieu：</span><br>
圣座冠冕就在马耳他？<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Terrible：</span><br>
很遗憾，不在哦。<br>
不过这里确实埋藏着能通向圣座冠冕藏匿地的「钥匙」。<br>
而我就是代表审判庭来对你的行为进行评价，并在适时地时候将其托付给你的。<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Richelieu：</span><br>
你现在来告诉我这件事，说明时机已经成熟了？<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Terrible：</span><br>
嗯。有其他人也在打圣座冠冕的主意，而破碎动荡的鸢尾教国已经无法承受再一个背叛者，或是野心家了。<br>
至少你的行动已经充分证明了你并不属于那两者之中，不是么？<br>
你想要力量，是因为你需要力量去做正确的事。<br>
既然如此，就由我们为你引导吧，那前往鸢尾教国力量顶峰的道路吧————<br>

哈…………哈哈………哈哈哈…………哈哈哈哈……<br>
不行……要冷静不能笑…………噗哈哈哈哈！怎么忍得住啊？！<br>
哈哈哈哈哈——！居然会发生这么具有戏剧性的展开……<br>
不知道从哪里冒出来的俾斯麦接过了铁血阵营的领导权？<br>
腓特烈大帝不再管事了？<br>
很好……很好…………很好很好很好！<br>
这样一来，终于没有人能够再阻碍我了！<br>
尽情欢呼，尽情颂扬吧！<br>
终于————<br>
属于撒丁帝国，属于我马可波罗的时代终于要来临了————<br>
