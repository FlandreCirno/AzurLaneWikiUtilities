Northern Parliament Control Center - Commanding Vessel<br>
Only a few days have passed since I returned from the Sea of Stars... but I am still reeling from what I experienced there over those short few hours.<br>
How is it possible for a plan of that scope to be kept secret for so long...<br>
Supposedly, the plan itself was set in motion before the war even began...<br>
How many people in the Eagle Union or even the entire Azur Lane know about it?<br>
And among those people, how many are able to see past the facade of mystique and actually grasp its profound implications?<br>
Secrets within secrets, plans within plans.<br>
If anything, it lends credence to the Ashes' suspicions.<br>
Many of the technological leaps made recently were actually tied to the servicing of the Sea of Stars project.<br>
The Sirens would not provide anything to us that they do not want us to reverse engineer.<br>
And directly researching Siren technology is too dangerous, as the possibility of it leading to dependence cannot be ignored.<br>
But looking at it from another angle...<br>
This is a completely different path that does not violate the principles of the Azur Lane. It avoids the pitfalls that ensnared the Iron Blood, and is also different from the Northern Parliament's path.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Georgia：</span><br>
Ahem... Commander, are you listening?<br>
<br>
"Oh..."<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："Yeah, I'm listening."</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2："Sorry, my mind wandered off for a bit."</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Georgia：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Oh? Then, would you care to share your take on the current situation, Commander?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''"Sorry... My mind actually wandered off for a bit."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Georgia：</span><br>
*sigh*...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Eldridge：</span><br>
Commander, if you're sleepy, then you should sleep.<br>
Eldridge... will fetch a pillow.<br>
<br>
"Thanks, but I'm good. It's probably better not to promote sleeping on the job..."<br>
"Would you mind repeating what you were just talking about, Georgia?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Georgia：</span><br>
Sure.<br>
As you can see, we're still in the process of assembling all the fleets participating in this operation.<br>
<br>
Georgia begins her explanation of the current situation by directing my attention to a map posted on the wall.<br>
Apparently, it had been updated several times during the duration I was thinking about other things...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Georgia：</span><br>
This is where our flagship fleet is located, and we will be working closely with the two Eagle Union strike teams to our flanks. Further back in the rear is the reserve fleet.<br>
These fleets will form the core of the Eagle Union's Task Force during this operation.<br>
In addition, New Jersey will be leading an additional NA Ocean strike team to the staging area.<br>
We are expected to meet up there with the two combined Northern Parliament fleets led by Sovetskaya Rossiya.<br>
<br>
"The Northern Parliament fleets look a lot bigger than expected... What about holding down the Polar front?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Georgia：</span><br>
According to them, there shouldn't be an issue as long as this theater doesn't turn into a war of attrition.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："What's the situation with the Royal Navy?"</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2："Has the Sakura Empire made any moves?"</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项3："Any developments with Iris Libre?"</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项4："What about the Vichya Dominion?"</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项5："Update me on the Sardegnian Fleet."</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项6："Can we expect anything from the Dragon Empery?"</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Georgia：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''According to our prior agreement, the bulk of the Royal Navy's forces has taken over the New Jersey fleet's responsibilities to clean up and defend the NA Ocean from Siren stragglers.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''The lack of new information leads me to assume that everything has been going smoothly on their end.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''But in other words, we shouldn't expect much assistance from the Royal Navy during this operation.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Georgia：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''According to our intel, the Sakura Fleet expedition fleet is still moored at Dakar and has not shown any signs of mobilization.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''However, the most predictable part about Akagi is how unpredictable she is, so we can't write off the possibility of their interference.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Georgia：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项3）</span>'''''So far, the Iris Libre fleet seems to be split up between operations in Africa and assisting the Royal Navy.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项3）</span>'''''Unfortunately, what Richelieu said earlier seems to still be true - that Iris Libre has no extra forces to spare.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Georgia：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项4）</span>'''''We have no information on Jean Bart, the flagship of the Vichya Empire, or her current whereabouts.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项4）</span>'''''But, we do have some existing information that they are fortifying their position at Toulon for self-defense and are unlikely to venture out.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项4）</span>'''''I suspect it would be difficult for them to leave the Mediterranée anyway, with the activities of the Royal Navy and Iris Libre.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Georgia：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项5）</span>'''''From what we know, their forces are scattered across several major ports.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项5）</span>'''''After the attack on Rome, Sardegna has adopted strict defensive measures.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项5）</span>'''''The same thing I said before also holds true for Sardegna - with the Royal Navy and Iris Libre's movements, they are unlikely to leave the Mediterranée.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Georgia：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项6）</span>'''''The who...?<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项6）</span>'''''Commander, they aren't deploying any forces for this operation.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Georgia：</span><br>
As for the Iron Blood, we've already been monitoring their large-scale movements.<br>
The signals alone would suggest that their fleet is several times more numerous than what we had intel on.<br>
That basically confirms that the Iron Blood have already deployed signal interference, like they did against the Royal Navy.<br>
We are in the process of performing aerial recon to do a visual confirmation of their actual numbers.<br>
<br>
"The same trick won't work twice."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Georgia：</span><br>
Finally, we still don't know where their current flagship, Friedrich der Große, is located. I'll contact you as soon as we get an update.<br>
<br>
"Thanks. So, how does it feel being out on the battlefield for the first time, Georgia?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Georgia：</span><br>
Uhh... Well, how do I put it... I was expecting to be on the front lines, doing something a bit more... glorious? Never expected I'd end up as the command ship and combat secretary.<br>
So, a bit different from what I was expecting. But not a big deal at the end of the day.<br>
<br>
"What's your overall view of the current situation?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Georgia：</span><br>
Judging by the numbers, we have a significant advantage in the head-on-head.<br>
But because this is a joint operation organized by different factions and fleets, it may be difficult to keep everyone on the same page.<br>
And to me, the Iron Blood always seems to have this capricious, unpredictable element to them... Until the dust settles, we don't know what tricks they'll have up their sleeve.<br>
<br>
"Good. You know what they say - never underestimate the enemy. Let's proceed with caution and stick to the plan."<br>
"Rest assured, you'll have plenty of opportunities to demonstrate your power on the battlefield."<br>
"Also, one last thing––"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Georgia：</span><br>
Got another question for me, Commander?<br>
<br>
As you can see, we're still in the process of assembling all the fleets participating in this operation.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Georgia：</span><br>
Uhh, about Eldridge, she's...<br>
<br>
After a lot of searching, we found Eldridge asleep on the floor not far from the ship's hatch.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Eldridge：</span><br>
Zzzzz...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Georgia：</span><br>
The most logical conclusion is that Eldridge fell asleep hugging the pillow because it was too comfortable.<br>
Hmm... Commander, you still look pretty worn-out yourself.<br>
You'll need a lot of focus once the operation starts, so why not rest up before then?<br>
<br>
Just watching Eldridge's peaceful slumber filled me with drowsiness as well.<br>
"I think I'll take you up on that bit of advice..."<br>
Scapa Flow, an important Royal Navy base, was taken by the Iron Blood in a surprise attack.<br>
And though this event would seem like a boiling point in the two factions' relationship...<br>
The attack was instead followed by an unexpected period of tranquility.<br>
But what undercurrents flow beneath the tenuous peace? <br>
A ploy engineered by the Iron Blood? A cunning rebuttal by the Royal Navy?<br>
Or perhaps, a greater truth that Towers above petty conflicts?<br>
In the calm before the curtains rise, the shifting of pieces can be heard within the silence.<br>
Preparations for battle, the humming of a Singularity, and the intersection of fates.<br>
Listen well to the rondo that is about to be played––<br>
For true peace... can perhaps only be found at the rainbow's end.<br>

<br>
NA Ocean - Southeast Sector E<br>
A Sakura Empire fleet advanced cautiously under the cover of night.<br>
Though the Azur Lane cleared the NA Ocean of Siren forces, these waters have only become more dangerous for the Sakura Empire.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jintsuu：</span><br>
No abnormalities detected underwater. At least it doesn't seem like any submarines are tailing us.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
My recons haven't run into any enemies either, so the route ahead of us should be safe as well!<br>
But having said that, now that the ceasefire agreement's been turned into scrap paper, these waters can turn into a battlefield at any moment...<br>
...There is one thing I don't understand though, Akagi.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Why I decided to bring you along to this operation?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
I have my own suspicions already... but it all boils down to Friedrich der Große, doesn't it?<br>
The Iron Blood is at a massive numbers disadvantage when compared to the entire Azur Lane, but Friedrich's deployments seem... awfully unconcerned.<br>
A lot of their forces are still being kept at the Floating Fortress, and even the fleet stationed at Dakar hasn't moved out either.<br>
Despite all of this, she invited us to meet her at the Scapa Flow anchorage of all places.<br>
It's as if the fire has come to the front door but she's still moving things around in the back of the house...<br>
What exactly is she planning...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kaga：</span><br>
I find myself in agreement with Zuikaku this time. Sister, there's something strange about Friedrich's invitation.<br>
Scapa Flow is quite close to the Royal Navy's homeland. The Iron Blood has basically put themselves in an indefensible position.<br>
Their deployment decisions are completely contrary to reason.<br>
Even though she did say she was going to "show us something interesting," how do we know that we're not being dragged in to serve as her meatshields?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
It's a possibility.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Akagi... If we're really going on such a risky mission, we should've brought more escorts, right?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
What good would that serve?<br>
The larger the fleet, the easier it is for our cover to be blown.<br>
Secondly, the more numbers we bring, the more tantalizing it would be for Friedrich to use us as meatshields.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Even if you feel wronged, I don't think we should be playing with our lives here...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
I have much more knowledge of this area's intel than you, so don't worry about troop deployments.<br>
Friedrich der Große has always operated from the shadows, and I'm not keen on the way she acts like a high-and-mighty puppetmaster.<br>
But, I do know that she wouldn't lie.<br>
In the invitation was the mention of showing us another "possibility." That alone is enough.<br>
That is the true purpose why we've journeyed thousands of miles from the Sakura Islands.<br>
Since we were not able to enter the heart of the NA Ocean, we must not miss this opportunity, no matter what.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
What does "another possibility" even mean...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
You'll understand when you see it.<br>
You wanted to know why I brought you along.<br>
I'll admit, a part of it is just me acting on a whim.<br>
But more importantly, you want to know too, don't you?<br>
I'm aware that the new Combined Fleet has been keeping an eye on me, and that many of you disagree with my decisions.<br>
But there's one thing you've failed to consider – we aren't looking at the same reality.<br>
Given what I've seen, I would make the same decisions, again and again.<br>
But what about your beliefs?<br>
When you've seen my reality, would you still be able to hold your same beliefs?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
My beliefs aren't that easy to shake...!<br>
But... I do hope to be able to understand your point of view a bit better.<br>
That way, I can truly convince you to choose another path!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Then, we shall wait and see.<br>
What kind of performance will the Iron Blood put on for us this time? Ahahaha...<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=The Royal Anchorage|选项=3|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<br>
Just on the horizon, the first vestiges of the anchorage became visible to the Sakura fleet.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Akagi, we're about to arrive at Scapa Flow!<br>
It seems like the Royal Navy hasn't even mobilized any forces in this area yet, let alone launched a counterattack.<br>
Does that mean they were caught off-guard by a surprise attack?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kaga：</span><br>
Perhaps... But look closely, Zuikaku.<br>
There aren't any signs of fighting here, and it doesn't seem like the Iron Blood has taken the facilities for their own use either.<br>
Did they drive out the Royal Navy and then leave things alone... or was the Iron Blood never interested in occupying Scapa Flow in the first place?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jintsuu：</span><br>
Isn't the Scapa Flow anchorage critical to the defense of the Royal Navy's homeland? It wouldn't make any sense for them to just give it up without a fight.<br>
It's possible that the Iron Blood needed this area to conduct some sort of experiment, but that still doesn't explain the absence of Royal Navy ships.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Hard to say. Just be glad we don't have to fight our way to the spectator seats.<br>
Let's go. I'm sure Friedrich will soon provide answers to our questions.<br>
<br>
Scapa Flow Anchorage<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Wow... Even though this place is enclosed by islands, there are so many waterways leading out...<br>
Seeing this in person really makes you appreciate how powerful Mother Nature can be.<br>
Akagi, what's that ship over there?<br>
It looks mass-produced, but a really old-fashioned model.<br>
<br>
As the fleet entered the harbor, the shadow of a large moored warship loomed in front of them.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
This is... a Queen Elizabeth-class?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
It doesn't look anything like the mass-produced ships we've seen before though...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Because it's not. This is a warship that predates the mass-produced "ships" of our era.<br>
We are "ships" born from Wisdom Cubes, but these vessels are constructs assembled from steel, protecting the seas long before our time.<br>
Before the advent of Wisdom Cubes, humanity built these vessels, and they became the blade they wielded.<br>
Nowadays, you'll only find transport ships and rare models of mass-produced ships made the old-fashioned way.<br>
Unlike modern mass-production which can churn out a large number of ships in a short amount of time, each one of these warships had unique designs and a long construction process.<br>
That is why when we, the shipgirls, appeared, these older vessels were quickly phased out of production.<br>
Even the mass-produced ships are little more than mementos of a bygone era, reserve forces that assist us in our operations.<br>
But some things are for the best. The era when these warships were the only line of defense against the Sirens was a tragic one.<br>
(Rather than being scrapped like so many others, at least you were able to spend the rest of your lives in the relative peace of this harbor...)<br>
(I wonder what would've happened to our "past forms"...)<br>
(...If they could have been preserved into an era of peace...)<br>
But judging by this warship's presence here, it seems that even the Iron Blood cannot touch the past.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
I wonder if we have any warships like this back in the Sakura Empire...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Who knows? It's something I stopped caring about long ago.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jintsuu：</span><br>
Akagi, an Iron Blood ship is coming our way.<br>
<br>
Several Iron Blood ships were moored along the coast of the harbor.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ägir：</span><br>
Heheh. You've come, Akagi of the Sakura Empire.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">August von Parseval：</span><br>
Good day, esteemed guests. You've been personally invited by Friedrich der Große.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
(Ägir and August von Parseval... the Iron Blood's latest blueprint ships...)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ägir：</span><br>
I can see the curiosity in your eyes, but let's save that for later.<br>
<br>
Guided by the Iron Blood ships, Akagi and her fleet made their way deeper into the harbor.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">August von Parseval：</span><br>
Right this way. Friedrich has been waiting for you.<br>

<br>
Scapa Flow Anchorage<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
It is a pleasure to see you again, my allies from the Sakura Empire.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Certainly, it feels like an eternity has passed since our banquet in Sardegna.<br>
Though the curtains have yet to rise, I am quite impressed at this... stage that you've set.<br>
How were you able to take Scapa Flow without a fight?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
A "performance" like this is best enjoyed by a select few, without the interruption of a boorish audience. Let's just say I employed a few little tricks.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
...Are you not worried about the Azur Lane bringing down the entire theater?<br>
I heard their staging area includes this area as well. It would be a pity if they barged in on your performance.<br>
You face the combined might of the Azur Lane, and also stand against the Commander.<br>
The jamming can buy you some time, but they will see through those tricks soon enough.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
You're right... Indeed, my fleet alone is unable to defeat the Azur Lane.<br>
If I was to call upon the Sakura Empire's aid, would you join us...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Hehehe... I'm glad you acknowledge the capability of the Sakura Empire...<br>
But I must decline your offer. We did not come here to take part in your play.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
Of course. And at no point did I expect you to agree.<br>
<br>
And just like you, I have no intention of participating in this play either.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
Incidentally, are you familiar with the incident that took place here at Scapa Flow?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
If I remember correctly, that was the Siren attack on Scapa Flow during the last great war, right?<br>
The Sirens ambushed the Iron Blood fleet, and the Azur Lane's leadership made the decision to not assist them...<br>
The Iron Blood fleet that fled into the harbor was completely annihilated... and that incident became one of the chief factors that led to the Iron Blood withdrawing from the Azur Lane.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
Yes, a fairly standard answer. That's what everyone has agreed on.<br>
Don't you think something doesn't quite add up though? Even though the Sirens were already the common enemy of humanity at that point, why would the Iron Blood main fleet flee into a Royal Navy harbor?<br>
In other words, if the Royal Navy took in the Iron Blood, then why is it that only the Iron Blood fleet got wiped out?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
..........<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
I've heard another account of the events, but I'm not sure how reliable it is.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
Let's hear it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
That there was actually no surprise attack – but rather, something went wrong when the Iron Blood was trying to capture Sirens for their own purposes.<br>
The Royal Navy was also caught in the crossfire, and Scapa Flow's facilities also suffered severe damage as a result.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
So you're saying, the Iron Blood invited the Sirens into the harbor...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Who knows what the truth really is? Maybe Friedrich has some insight. After all, we weren't invited here simply to chat, correct?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
It is said that history is written by the victors. But to write is to compose a narrative.<br>
But we are not writers – we are warriors. What is a record in comparison to the scars of war?<br>
For us, the truth of this battle is––<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">???：</span><br>
Enough of your senseless bloviating, Friedrich!<br>
We could have hired a jester if we wanted to listen to someone talk in circles all day!<br>
<br>
A small girl suddenly burst into the room in the middle of Friedrich's monologue.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kaga：</span><br>
Queen Elizabeth...?!<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
That's right! You are in the presence of the Queen!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
What an impetuous child. Hehe.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Wait, this isn't making any sense to me... Why is the leader of the Royal Navy here?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
My, it seems like you got your hands on much more than just an antiquated warship.<br>
I see, so this is the secret behind the Iron Blood's little "transaction." Control of Scapa Flow, in exchange for the little queen's safety.<br>
Color me surprised by the extraordinary lengths to which you'd go, Friedrich. You'd even hold one of the major faction's leaders hostage.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
As if! If anything, it's the other way around! Friedrich is currently under the supervision of the Royal Navy!<br>
Besides, if I was the hostage here, I wouldn't be moving around freely.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
Indeed... What kind of hostage would have the luxury to barge in during the kidnapper's speech?<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Good grief, just how much do you love listening to yourself talk?<br>
Belfast and the others are almost done with their preparation. The Singularity is getting hard to maintain, so I'll need to have them head over soon.<br>
You wish to know what really happened at Scapa Flow? Then I shall show you the truth!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
Very well. The Azur Lane is making progress faster than expected, so we must make haste.<br>
I look forward to hearing the piece you will play for us, little queen.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Hmph. And hear it you shall!<br>
<br>
Queen Elizabeth pulled out a communicator and pressed the button, issuing her instructions to the recipients on the other end.<br>
In that moment, the still waters of Scapa Flow suddenly became turbulent and the surface of the sea began to cave in.<br>
From the crevice rose an empty sun, a gateway pulsating with otherworldly energy.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
Allow me to welcome you once more, esteemed guests from the Sakura Empire.<br>
Harken to the coming of the final movement!<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=Singularity|选项=5|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<br>
Under the instructions of Queen Elizabeth, a new Singularity rose above the waters of Scapa Flow.<br>
A steady stream of energy seeped from the ring of light surrounding the gate, evaporating the surrounding seawater into a fine mist.<br>
In contrast to its intimidating form, a rainbow glistened within the shining mist, like a road stretching beyond the gateway.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
My... This is rather unexpected...<br>
Is this based on the Iron Blood's Singularity research? No... this is much more advanced than anything I've seen before...<br>
Judging by the looks on the little queen's face, the Royal Navy seems to have played a part in this.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
I'll leave it to your imagination. What I will say is, none of this conflicts with my child's wishes.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
I see... I'll also assume that you didn't put on this show just to ask us to close the Singularity.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
Correct. Beyond the Singularity lies the truth of what happened at Scapa Flow, as well as the answers you seek.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Wait, hold on, this is a bit much to take in all at once... What's the deal with this Singularity, and are you saying we have to go THROUGH it?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
It is another branch, a world parallel to ours.<br>
But this gateway does not lead directly to another world, but rather a Mirror Sea of sorts that projects the records of the Natural Calculation System.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kaga：</span><br>
So if I'm understanding this correctly, it's different from the realm where you retrieved those META ships?<br>
The only information we have comes from the reports you've given us. How do we know that it's safe to pass through this Singularity?<br>
What proof can you offer that beyond this door lies the things that you promised?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
...I want to see the truth, Kaga.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kaga：</span><br>
Then I shall remain here until you return.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Suit yourself, Kaga.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
Ägir and August von Parseval will remain behind as well then. If the Azur Lane comes, you know what to do.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">August von Parseval：</span><br>
Understood...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ägir：</span><br>
Hehe. Don't underestimate me, Friedrich der Große. Just who do you think I am?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Jintsuu, contact Yamashiro's group. Provide them the instructions on how to get here.<br>
...Will you be coming with us as well, little queen?<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Of course! And stop it with the little, and the queen! Just Elizabeth will do!<br>
We've already done some preliminary scouting, so follow my lead!<br>
<br>
With those words, Queen Elizabeth was the first to disappear through the gate.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Man, I'm still not so sure about this...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
It's fine. She may seem moody and fickle at times, but she is the leader of the Royal Navy for a reason.<br>
The fact that she went in first should be solid enough proof that it's safe.<br>
We can trust her for now. Zuikaku, await my instructions once you're inside.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Got it, Akagi.<br>
<br>
Akagi and Zuikaku disappeared into the Singularity as well, with Friedrich der Große following right behind them.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
At long last, our rondo finally begins.<br>

<br>
NA Ocean - East Continental Shelf Sector C<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">August von Parseval：</span><br>
Ulrich, the Singularity has been opened.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
Understood. All preparations done on my end as well.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
If the Singularity is up and running, that means it's time to ramp up the EM interference.<br>
Let's get to know each other better with a little dance, Azur Lane~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
I'll lead the charge, then. Hopefully you'll be able to sow chaos in the enemy's ranks, the one thing you're good for.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Aww, how mean of you, Ulrich. Look, our dance has already started~<br>
<br>
The panels of Ulrich's electronic equipment suddenly erupted with countless "ally" symbols.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
Hmph, not bad... Seems like you're capable of getting serious after all.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
You flatter me~ This only works because our destroyers scattered throughout the area have relay devices equipped onto them.<br>
They'll see that we outnumber them three-to-one on the radar now. It'll be quite a headache to figure out what's real and what isn't~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
Unfortunately, we can't take a head-on engagement against a fleet of that size––<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
But luckily, we don't have to. The important thing is that we buy time – and as long as we can force them to advance cautiously, we can avoid a direct confrontation.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
No, things won't be that simple.<br>
After all, there's something you're dying to try, right? For example, fighting against the Commander...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
...If you're going to put the words in my mouth, then... Yeah, that's something I'd like to try at least once~<br>
I'll be passing on-site command to you, Ulrich, so you can do whatever you want with the fleet.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
Hmph. Very well. You'll have an easier time making your move as well.<br>
(Farce or not, opportunities to spar against the Commander don't come often.)<br>
(I'll have to plan every move carefully... Tch, what a pain.)<br>
Adalbert, Roon, U-81, change in plans. Intercept the Eagle Union fleet.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U81：</span><br>
Sure thing! I was hoping I'd get to play tag with them a bit more, but that's fine.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Adalbert：</span><br>
All righty, heard you loud and clear~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Roon：</span><br>
Ahh, how refreshing it is to get to fight again~<br>
Mainz and I will be waiting for the Commander here. When are you coming, Ulrich?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ulrich von Hutten：</span><br>
Soon enough. Don't engage until I arrive.<br>
(If we can pin down the Commander's flagship, the Azur Lane will also have to change their plans. Two birds with one stone.)<br>
I'll make full use of this opportunity!<br>

<br>
Inside the Singularity...<br>
The other side of the gateway appeared to be the same place that the group had just come from, except...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
This is... also Scapa Flow? But look at all the destruction here...<br>
How terrible... An entire fleet reduced to burning scrap metal, just like the reports said...<br>
<br>
Friedrich had described this place as a projection of Siren records, but the palpable destruction in the air leaves the onlookers in shock.<br>
According to the preliminary investigations that were conducted, the events recorded here directly followed the destruction of the Iron Blood fleet by the Sirens at Scapa Flow.<br>
Yet no Sirens are present at the scene, as if they had either all withdrawn, or were simply omitted from the recording.<br>
The only things that remain are smoke, flames, and the slowly sinking debris of destroyed warships.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Look at all the old-fashioned warships here... They're simply no match for the Sirens.<br>
The port's facilities look like they've been ripped apart as well. Does the Royal Navy have any records of such extensive damage being done?<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
None. But as we can clearly see, the anchorage was rebuilt following the incident at some point.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
I see. This is quite literally a Reenactment of the events from back then.<br>
But you didn't actually take us into the past.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
What you see here indeed transpired in the past, but we did not rip open the fabric of time.<br>
It is not necessarily our past, but rather one of many possibilities.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
...That doesn't tell me anything. The contents here could've been tampered with in a number of ways.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
Indeed, but the destruction that you see here is, in fact, a reality.<br>
This is a Siren experimental site, a Reenactment of a battle that took place in our world.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
I can't believe how many Iron Blood ships were lost here...<br>
So, the thing about Azur Lane not helping was true after all...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
Isn't there someone here better suited to answer that question?<br>
Even though we were not firsthand witnesses to this incident, there should still be direct accounts of what happened.<br>
It is about time we hear the other side of the story.<br>
Since we invited them all the way here, why don't we share the truth with our guests here?<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
...Hmph.<br>
<br>
Queen Elizabeth hesitates for a while, but eventually lets out a sigh of resignation.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
How could the Azur Lane betray them like that?!<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
...Betray? After seeing all this destruction in front of you, do you still believe something like that happened?<br>
First of all, Scapa Flow belongs to the Royal Navy.<br>
Have you ever considered how grave the consequences of losing Scapa Flow would be to the Royal Islands?<br>
What good would selling out the Iron Blood do if it resulted in us losing our very homeland?<br>
Additionally, the Iron Blood aren't the only ones who suffered terrible losses that day!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Wow, you're right... There are shipwrecks with Royal Navy insignias as well...<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Not just a few of them, either. I'm sure you'll find more if you fly your airplanes around.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Ugh... Then...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
The Iron Blood tried to carry out a Siren capture operation, which ended up failing and angering the Sirens.<br>
They fled for their lives to Scapa Flow, leading the Sirens right to it... resulting in the destruction of Scapa Flow and both of the fleets there.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Naturally, this account originated from the Royal Navy's upper echelons. Take that information with a grain of salt.<br>
Having that said... It should be clear that the Royal Navy fought alongside the Iron Blood here – and shared the same fate.<br>
However, any trace of that happening was erased... along with what happened to our ships as well as Scapa Flow itself.<br>
The question on everyone's mind at this point probably is, how could destruction of this scale avoid the public eye?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
...They wanted to stamp out any evidence that the Royal Navy worked together with the Iron Blood.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
That may well be the case. There is still much we don't know about this Singularity – and what occurred here.<br>
What we see here at best can be understood to be the Sirens' point of view. The only ones who can truly tell us what happened... are the ones who were actually here at the time.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
...Judging by the looks of things, there weren't any survivors.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
That is why I decided to cooperate with the Iron Blood – so that the people who were here can reveal the truth to us.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
Yes... Can you hear their whispers upon these waters?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:96}：</span><br>
What are you talking about? I don't get it...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
Do you feel the resentment of their shattered forms?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:91}：</span><br>
.........<br>
Stand behind me, Zuikaku. Something's about to happen.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:96}：</span><br>
Y-yes!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
Even in this place, I can see the shape of the history written around them.<br>
Their glory, their shame. Their achievements, their oblivion. The flames burning across the sea are an ode from the past.<br>
Their joy, their sorrow. Their melancholy, their anger. Each sound that echoes through this hollow sky gives form to their suffering.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
.........<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
The truth is inviolably carved into this space. And thus, their emotions yet linger as well.<br>
<br>
A number of Wisdom Cubes began to spin around Friedrich der Große as she walked to the middle of the Singularity's waters.<br>
As they spun faster and faster, a dazzling halo of blue light rippled outwards to quash the ominous red of the burning sea.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
May your minds be etched. May history give you form. May your hulls inherit your essence.<br>
May your new bodies become the Arks to bear our history forward––<br>
A ship that is neither a ship, a human that is neither a human – become the blade that shall strike down our foes.<br>
...Open your eyes to the light of creation, my friends!<br>
<br>
The surrounding waters became turbulent from the blinding oscillation of the Cubes, kicking up waves that knock on the shattered coffins of ruined warships.<br>
The light shone brighter and brighter, blue turning into an incandescent gold, so bright that the onlookers had to shield their eyes.<br>
But from between the gaps in their fingers, they witnessed a sight they would be able to forget––<br>
The overflowing light from the Cubes began to dissipate, and the Cubes soon followed suit as if dissolving into the sky.<br>
From the silence that once again fell over the ruined battlefield, the sound of soft breathing could be heard.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">????：</span><br>
..........<br>
<br>
The ever-so-faint sound shook Akagi to her core. Not just her – but everyone else there – knew what had just happened.<br>
The ordering of disorder into order. The humming of the soul, given form from the earth. The authority of the divine, held within mortal hands.<br>
Without a doubt, they had witnessed...<br>
The birth of a shipgirl.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Seydlitz：</span><br>
..........<br>
.......Where... am I?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
.........<br>
Welcome to our world, battlecruiser Seydlitz.<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=Rebirth|选项=8|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<br>
The light continued to pulse several more times until finally, Friedrich lowered her arms.<br>
The newly born shipgirls began to gather around her.<br>
Each had a different expression on her face – astonishment, relief, curiosity, vexation.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Seydlitz：</span><br>
I am Seydlitz, Iron Blood battlecruiser. It is good to see you again, Friedrich der Große.<br>
I remember the last time we fought together... Wait, scratch all that, I seem to have the wrong person...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
No worries. All rivers flow to the same ocean, my friend.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Seydlitz：</span><br>
I... see? Well, in any case, I still need to get used to this new body and equipment, but I'm always ready to fight.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yorck：</span><br>
My, I never expected to experience something like this. Hehehe...<br>
So, whose orders will I be following now?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lützow：</span><br>
*yawwwwn*... What the hell, I was just starting to enjoy my nap.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Seydlitz：</span><br>
Lützow, I don't think this is any time to be napping.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lützow：</span><br>
Got a problem with me saying what's on my mind? Is it controversial to say that it's better to wake up naturally than to be woken up?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yorck：</span><br>
Would you prefer to go back to eternal sleep within a sea of flames and wrecked warships?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lützow：</span><br>
Nah, I'm over that.<br>
Well, I feel way more flexible in this body, and I'm pretty cute too. So I'll forgive you for waking me up.<br>
Anyway, I'm the Iron Blood battlecruiser Lützow. If you don't need me for anything else, I'm going back to sleep~ <br>
Ah, nice, my rigging makes for a nice makeshift bed. Peace out, and don't call me if you need me~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
Hehe. Do enjoy yourself.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Thüringen：</span><br>
Friedrich, are we the only ones?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
Unfortunately, yes.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Thüringen：</span><br>
...My friends...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
It's no good. I don't know the exact reason why, but it doesn't seem like any new ships can emerge from this place.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Thüringen：</span><br>
I see. Perhaps this, too, is fate.<br>
I, battleship Thüringen, vow to fight once more for the Iron Blood, no matter what form I take.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Elbing：</span><br>
I-I'm Elbing, Iron Blood light cruiser... Umm, I'm not sure why this opportunity was wasted on me... but I'm fine with being used as a decoy or a meatshield...<br>
I already know I'm going to let everyone down... Even if I try my best, I'm just going to fail anyway... *sigh*...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
I never expected something like this to be possible, Elizabeth.<br>
Did you feign being caught off guard by the Iron Blood to avoid the suspicions of the Naval HQ?<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
I'm not going to answer that question.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
I expected as much. So, what now? Are you going to do that too?<br>
If Friedrich can pull it off, there shouldn't be anything stopping you––<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Unfortunately, that's not how it works. This place was designed as an Iron Blood experimentation site.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
(Interesting. There's more to this technology than meets the eye – and more restrictions that I'm not aware of.)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yorck：</span><br>
E-Emden, are you alright? You haven't said anything this whole time...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Emden：</span><br>
Yes, I'm fine.<br>
"Emden has no need for your concern. She is not so weak. We are not so weak."<br>
I am Emden, the Swan of the East. I await your orders.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
The Swan of the East? You must be the Dresden-class Emden then...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Emden：</span><br>
"And I am the Emden of the Königsberg-class. I met my fate here as a warship."<br>
Yes, I heard your call, and when I followed the light, I was brought here.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
It seems that your fates were intertwined when you were called here.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Emden：</span><br>
I cannot say for sure.<br>
"Perhaps her strong desire to seek out beauty imprinted her fate to this hull." <br>
But now, we are here. Therefore, we exist.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
Indeed. This is not quite what I expected when I called out to Emden.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Emden：</span><br>
"You would wield these powers on a whim, without fully understanding what they are capable of?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
On a whim? Perhaps. There is more that my child has yet to tell me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Emden：</span><br>
"So, what would you have us do?"<br>
Shall we hunt the Sirens once more?<br>
"Did you miss us that badly?"<br>
Or... did you wish to make up for past regrets?<br>
"Though, I care little for your motivations. The others seem to have accepted our new reality already."<br>
But you... You're both familiar, yet so very different. What exactly are you?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
I'm not the Friedrich der Große that you know, but does it matter?<br>
I have no past – I am but a crystallization of a desire.<br>
But, I am the blueprint ship, Friedrich der Große.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Emden：</span><br>
You're right, it doesn't matter.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
As for your earlier question, there is nothing I ask of you.<br>
This is a Siren experimentation site, and you are newly-born shipgirls. Do I need to elaborate any further?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lützow：</span><br>
Follow our instincts, huh? Sounds good to me. I hate taking orders, after all.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
Did you enjoy your nap?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lützow：</span><br>
Some things are more interesting than sleep. See?<br>
You're not going to introduce me to the other ships over there?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
I will. They are your new allies.<br>
Their names are Akagi and Zuikaku, aircraft carriers from the Sakura Empire.<br>
And over there is Her Majesty, Queen Elizabeth of the Royal Navy.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Thüringen：</span><br>
Strange bedfellows, but it seems that the situation is desperate enough to warrant it.<br>
I suppose this means that the Azur Lane managed to achieve its goal.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lützow：</span><br>
What the heck is an aircraft carrier?<br>
Ugh, and I've never seen any of this equipment before. Gimme a bit to figure all this stuff out.<br>
And hol' up, are you seriously saying that little girl right there is the QUEEN? I thought she was supposed to be bigger and have a bit more... armor around this area?<br>
Ehh? She's even smaller than I thought!<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
You. You're already dead.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lützow：</span><br>
Ahaha... Easy now, I just was expecting a bit more out of a battleship.<br>
See, Thüringen is a proper-sized battleship, right?<br>
But I guess size isn't everything... Elbing and Emden look completely different even though they're both cruisers...<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Bloody hell! If you keep making fun of me I'm going to lop some of that fat off with my main battery!!<br>
You bunch are just as insufferable as that Deutschland!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Thüringen：</span><br>
I apologize for her rudeness, Your Majesty.<br>
We all know that it is not size that determines a battleship's value.<br>
It was uncouth of Lützow to assume that you aren't a battleship simply because you are... lacking in certain areas.<br>
She tends to speak before she thinks at times, so I do hope you harbor enough magnanimity in your bosom to forgive her.<br>
You ought to apologize too, Lützow.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lützow：</span><br>
Why? I was just stating facts, wasn't I?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:96}：</span><br>
C'mon, just do it so we can move on...<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
I am SO done with both of you! I don't need your stupid apologies!!<br>
*sigh*... As I was saying, the Royal Navy will be cooperating with the Iron Blood.<br>
But alliances are not formed so easily overnight.<br>
As shipgirls, it may be easy for us to work together, but our factions are more divided than ever before.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lützow：</span><br>
...Huh?<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Why does that surprise you? Countless things threatened both the formation and the integrity of the Azur Lane even during the last war.<br>
The same is true now – or at least, that's what the Naval HQ seems to want. <br>
Anyway, Friedrich, don't forget the reason why we're here.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
Naturally. Once you're done talking.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Hey, it's not like I wanted to bring this up in the first place, if SOMEONE would stop teasing me about my body!<br>
Remember, the Singularity's gate is being kept open by energy from the outside. We don't have forever.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
Indeed. Now, my friends from the High Sea Fleet... I have a question for all of you–<br>
What exactly happened at Scapa Flow?<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=Memory Lane|选项=9|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lützow：</span><br>
Oh boy. I was half-expecting this question. *yaaawn*...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
Would you mind answering it?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lützow：</span><br>
No can do. We're not the ships that sank back then.<br>
Buuut... Strange as it sounds, I have hazy memories of what happened here, like a distant dream...<br>
Can't tell you whether they're real or not, and even if they are, who's to say my account is accurate?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
Don't worry about that. Whatever you remember is what really happened.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lützow：</span><br>
Really, huh? Then let me warn you: what I do remember is no cozy campfire story.<br>
Not even sure why you're so keen on knowing. I'm not gonna like telling it, and you're not gonna like hearing it.<br>
I've got better things to do with this life, so why not just move on?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
There's no need to lament what could have been, for either of us. We simply want to know the truth behind what happened.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Thüringen：</span><br>
Hmm... It might be hard to explain things to you though.<br>
There were no shipgirls around back then, so we aren't "eyewitnesses" in a literal sense.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
But your connection to this place has left an imprint upon your hulls.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Thüringen：</span><br>
You do have a point. My memories seem not to be from the perspective of a warship, but rather from that of a person.<br>
Almost as if... we had witnessed the event as we are now – as shipgirls.<br>
But as Lützow said, it's all quite hazy.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
A restructuring of cognition... So it wasn't just my imagination...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
There is a dramatic shift from a warship's passive perception to a shipgirl's active cognition. The nature of this process is beyond our current understanding.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lützow：</span><br>
Confused? Yeah, I am too. Don't worry about it.<br>
Look, you don't wanna hear a long-winded explanation, do you? I've got a better, more fun alternative.<br>
We'll just act out what happened. The good ol' show, don't tell.<br>
<br>
Scapa Flow - Surrounding Waters<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Seydlitz：</span><br>
Hits confirmed, Lützow! The Siren fleet is losing speed!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yorck：</span><br>
See? It was worth it to practice your gunnery.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lützow：</span><br>
Great, keep it up. I wanna see at least a hundred Siren wrecks by the time you're done.<br>
*yawn*... Crushing victories always make me sleepy.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Elbing：</span><br>
We're nearing Royal Navy territory... I bet they're going to designate us as hostiles and open fire...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Emden：</span><br>
"That would be a damned declaration of war. The Royal Navy wouldn't dare."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yorck：</span><br>
Don't worry about them. The Sirens are our only target today.<br>
Sure, we're not allied with Azur Lane, but we're all allies in humanity's fight against the Siren menace. The Royal Navy will have to pardon a little trespassing.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Thüringen：</span><br>
Indeed, this isn't the time for petty infighting. Although, we should let them know we're here, just to be safe.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Elbing：</span><br>
That's a good idea. Let's do i– Err, I mean... Terrible idea! Let's not do that!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Thüringen：</span><br>
Thanks for the blessings. Once we get to Scapa Flow, I'll message the Royal Navy about the incoming Sirens, then we resume our attack.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lützow：</span><br>
Sounds like a plan! Fleet, head for Scapa Flow and attack!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Thüringen：</span><br>
The message, Lützow! Don't omit so many crucial details!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
...I'm gonna assume this didn't all stem from someone forgetting to send a message, right?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lützow：</span><br>
Nah. Thüringen did it after we entered the Royal Navy's waters.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
So you DID enter without permission! Being chased by Sirens isn't a valid excuse for breaking international law!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lützow：</span><br>
Relaaax. You're making a mountain out of a molehill.<br>
Besides, this wasn't the first time we'd done it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Not even the first time, huh...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lützow：</span><br>
Yeah, the Royal Navy didn't like it, but what's it matter anyway?<br>
They'd suffered big casualties in one of the Sirens' previous attacks, so they weren't in any position to stop us.<br>
Plus, this was a good chance to salvage Siren tech to end the war sooner. Is that excuse not good enough?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
You're giving me less and less reason to side with you right now.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
So? What happened after that?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lützow：</span><br>
Well, you see... That's when the Royal Navy showed up.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Seydlitz：</span><br>
Multiple Royal Navy ships sighted! Straight to our... Wait, they're using light signals!<br>
They're saying... "Halt immediately and submit to an inspection."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Emden：</span><br>
"An inspection? What do they take us for, merchant vessels? I am insulted."<br>
Ignore their message. They haven't the forces to even try to stop us.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Seydlitz：</span><br>
But Emden, almost their entire defense fleet is advancing towards us!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Emden：</span><br>
"Their 'entire fleet'? You're talking about a handful of ships. We outnumber them."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Seydlitz：</span><br>
While, yes, our numbers are superior, their force consists of battleships and battlecruisers!<br>
Should a firefight break out, we are highly likely to suffer casualties.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Elbing：</span><br>
Yeah... Some of us will end up on the pile of wrecks we're supposed to capture...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Emden：</span><br>
"Like hell we will. Damn the Royal Navy... What is with them?"<br>
"Fine, we'll play nice. Patch them through."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lützow：</span><br>
Seydlitz, tell 'em we'll come to a stop.<br>
Oh, but also tell them we're not submitting to a patdown.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Warspite：</span><br>
"Iron Blood! You're, like, totally not supposed to be in Royal Navy waters. Get outta here!"<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Valiant：</span><br>
"You were smart enough to stop, so we'll be nice and not open fire on your bratwursty butts!"<br>
"Turn around and leave, lassies! Be on your way now and we'll overlook this little whoopsie-daisy!"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Are those exact quotes, or...?<br>
Doesn't sound like the Warspite and Valiant I know.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:96}：</span><br>
For reference, Warspite looks like this.<br>
And Valiant like this.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lützow：</span><br>
Really, huh? I'm seeing a pattern here – all Royal Navy battleships are flat as boards.<br>
Must run in the family, seeing as they're all dwarves too.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
That is blatantly untrue, hussy!<br>
Drop this digression at once and get back on topic!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lützow：</span><br>
Guess I struck a nerve, huh? Fine, Your Majesty.<br>
Actually, this would be easier to just explain than to show.<br>
Basically, we stayed right where we were. After all, what reason did we have to leave?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Other than, I dunno, the whole TRESPASSING thing? None, I guess.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lützow：</span><br>
Back then, I guess we thought they'd break off if we just stood our ground.<br>
But as fate would have it, they didn't. They stood their ground too.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Keep treading thin ice and it's eventually gonna collapse beneath you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lützow：</span><br>
Hmm. Maybe we were pushing our luck after all. Maybe.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Hold on a minute. Weren't Sirens pursuing you? What became of them?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lützow：</span><br>
Well, we got in formation again and fired at them. What else?<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
WHILE the Royal Navy had its guns trained on you?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lützow：</span><br>
Exactamundo. It was as simple as that. *yawn*...<br>
Man, explaining all this is so tiring and boring...<br>
Elbing, Seydlitz, take it from here. Peace ooouut– Zzz...<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Did she just fall asleep mid-sentence?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Seydlitz：</span><br>
I sincerely apologize for her discourtesy, Your Majesty! Allow me to continue where she left off!<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Seydlitz：</span><br>
Because of the approaching Sirens, we promptly petitioned a ceasefire agreement to the Royal Navy fleet.<br>
They swiftly accepted and joined up with us. Dispatching the Sirens became the top priority for both our fleets.<br>
As our force consisted of ships with wildly varying strengths and weaknesses, we agreed the best strategy was to split up and attack from multiple angles.<br>
All seemed fine, until the Sirens came fully into view... They weren't the ones that had pursued us.<br>
Their hulls were decorated with striking patterns. Their armor was so thick even a battleship's main guns only scratched it.<br>
And their firepower... It was unlike anything I'd ever seen. It effortlessly tore through our armor that had previously weathered countless hits.<br>
One volley was all it took to neutralize half our fleet. Our formation fell apart, as one might expect...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Emden：</span><br>
"Indeed. Those Sirens – they were on a whole other level."<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
What was the Royal Navy fleet doing?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Emden：</span><br>
"They had gone another way to engage a different Siren fleet."<br>
"I can only imagine they had a much harder fight than us, even if they didn't have to face any new Sirens."<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Warspite：</span><br>
Royal Navy! Find and engage the enemy!<br>
Expel those beasts from our home waters!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yorck：</span><br>
Launching a counterattack with a force that size? Do they have a death wish?<br>
Just look what happened to our superior fleet. It's in shambles after that last attack...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Thüringen：</span><br>
Still, you have to applaud their courage.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lützow：</span><br>
Recklessness, more like. Either way, fine by me if those suckers go belly up.<br>
Probably gonna happen any second now. The odds are stacked hard against them.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Seydlitz：</span><br>
The Sirens are far more powerful than us! Even if by some miracle we manage to defeat them, it'll cost us nearly our whole fleet!<br>
Emden, I advise that we retreat now while we still have the strength and time!<br>
If we do not make it back to port, nobody will know just how dangerous these new Sirens are!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Emden：</span><br>
"Tsk... We've no other choice. Retreat at once."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lützow：</span><br>
Already? Works for me. Toodles, Royal Navy!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
So you turned your backs on them and ran?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Emden：</span><br>
"Who wouldn't have? There was no way we could defeat those Sirens."<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
What you're saying is... our fleet just...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Emden：</span><br>
"Let us finish. We knew the Royal Navy's ships were all doomed if we fled."<br>
"So we changed our minds. Instead, we came to their rescue."<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
...You did? That was quite valorous of you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Emden：</span><br>
It was a move brought on by desperation as much as valor.<br>
"We knew not how fast these new Sirens were. They may well have chased us down if the Royal Navy couldn't keep them busy for long enough."<br>
That being the case, we came to aid them in exchange for being allowed inside Scapa Flow.<br>
"We all know just how vital Scapa Flow was to your operations out here."<br>
"And because of its strategical significance, you've gone far out of your way to reinforce it."<br>
All the facilities one could need. Astounding defenses. Massive stockpiles of supplies. It was such a perfect base, not even the Sirens dared attack it.<br>
"If we could make it there, the Sirens could be repelled and we could contact our superiors. Frankly, it was our one and only option for survival."<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Did our fleet agree to this proposal?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Emden：</span><br>
"Yes. Swiftly, much like with the ceasefire."<br>
"Our fleets regrouped, and together, we sailed for Scapa Flow as quickly as we could."<br>
<br>
Scapa Flow Harbor<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Warspite：</span><br>
We're out of the woods now. Welcome to our pride and honour – Scapa Flow.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Seydlitz：</span><br>
Thank you, Lady Warspite! Thank all of you, my friends, for your graceful assistance!<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Valiant ：</span><br>
Sure. Now that you're well into our domain, it's time for that inspection.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lützow：</span><br>
Aww, come on! What's the point in doing that now?<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Valiant ：</span><br>
Your fleet has taken significant damage, has it not? An inspection is a prerequisite for repairs.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lützow：</span><br>
Oh. Fair enough. Inspect whoever you need to, then.<br>
I made it out without a scratch, so I'll just have a nap. For business inquiries, talk to Emden and Seydlitz.<br>
Also, where's the VIP lounge? This place is too big NOT to have one.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Valiant ：</span><br>
You crash at somebody's place and expect VIP treatment? That's brave...<br>
Come with me. I shall guide you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
From wary strangers to friends just like that, huh?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Emden：</span><br>
Indeed. Let this story be remembered as a shining example of sisterhood on the battlefield.<br>
"It was an uneasy union, but a union nonetheless. Our enemies were Sirens, not fellow shipgirls."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Yeah, and that still rings true.<br>
Hang on, the fact remains that something bad went down at Scapa Flow...<br>
Which can only mean... the Sirens DID attack after all!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Emden：</span><br>
Well deduced. The whole story is a little more complicated than that, however.<br>
"At first, everything was normal. We stocked up on supplies, patched ourselves up..."<br>
"Then, at some point, we lost all contact with the outside world."<br>
"Our communicators should've been working, which made us suspect some kind of Royal Navy interference. However, they were having the same problem."<br>
"That, in turn, led us to the conclusion that it was the Sirens' doing."<br>
"It was then that the seas and skies turned a strange color, and Scapa Flow's harbor – all of it – began to rumble."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
The telltale signs of a Mirror Sea...!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Emden：</span><br>
Is that what you call it? How novel. We had no words for it until now.<br>
"After that otherworldly phenomenon began, the Sirens sent in their airwings."<br>
"Their planes weren't like what you carriers use. Compared to the planes of our time, they were far, far more destructive."<br>
"It's a mystery how their planes even reached the island. It should've been far beyond their reach."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
I reckon the Sirens had an aircraft carrier deployed nearby.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Emden：</span><br>
"Yes, we know that now. But the past Emden could never have guessed that."<br>
Ah, carrier-based aircraft. Aren't they a marvel of scientific ingenuity?<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
......<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Seydlitz：</span><br>
The Royal Navy's coastal batteries were key to our survival of the Sirens' third wave of attack.<br>
Even so, we were at the end of our rope, and we knew it. Our only option was to flee Scapa Flow posthaste.<br>
But... The moment we put our escape plan into motion, a beam of light shot down from the sky... and that's where my memory stops.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Emden：</span><br>
Sadly, I know not who or what created that light, nor what its purpose was.<br>
"That is the end of our story. We've no more we can tell you."<br>
"The light obliterated all Iron Blood and Royal Navy forces on Scapa Flow. At least, assuming the record of this place is accurate."<br>
And that is the truth. The truth you so badly wanted to know.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
It seems the pieces are falling into place.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
This information differs from what our higher-ups have. Truly, this changes everything... <br>
The incident at Scapa Flow was neither the product of a Royal Navy betrayal, nor Iron Blood foolishness...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
I've got a theory on that light... It all makes sense if that was Purifier's omitter beam.<br>
None of us have ever personally seen a weapon that can raze an entire base in an instant, but that's the only lead I've got.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Emden：</span><br>
I trust your insight. You've fought more Sirens than any of us.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
I've fought those assholes more times than I can remember... But I do remember everything about them.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Seydlitz：</span><br>
It is an honor to be in the presence of such seasoned, noble warriors!<br>
If our fleet had had someone like you by our side, things would surely have gone another way.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
I have a proposition. Do you think you could eliminate the Sirens around here?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Seydlitz：</span><br>
What, exactly, are you asking of us?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
If this test site was built to effectively replicate the events of Scapa Flow, there must be info on this laser weapon of theirs somewhere here.<br>
Furthermore, it's worth gauging the strength of that new Siren model, as compared to us.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Thüringen：</span><br>
In other words, you're giving us the opportunity to avenge our former selves?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yorck：</span><br>
Not just that, it's good practice for getting used to our new riggings – and bodies.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Elbing：</span><br>
O-okay... I hope we'll adjust well and dest– Err, excuse me. Everything I wish for never comes true...<br>
Ahem... I hope that we'll never encounter any enemies... that the laser beam will destroy us all...<br>
And of course, that I'll sink to the bottom of the ocean...!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yorck：</span><br>
You could just not hope for anything and save yourself the effort.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Emden：</span><br>
Friedrich der Große, is that an order? An order, as the one who gave us new lives and brought us to the Iron Blood?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
It is no order.<br>
However, you as shipgirls have a duty to fulfill – to defeat the Sirens and defend humanity's oceans.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Emden：</span><br>
"Seydlitz, go and wake Lützow. We have enemies to fell."<br>
Heehee... How exciting it is to be fighting once again.<br>

Outside the Singularity - NA Ocean<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z2：</span><br>
Eugen, you've tampered with the radar, haven't you?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Not this time. What's wrong with it?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z2：</span><br>
"Not this time"... I see...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Really, I haven't. You're wondering about the Eagle Union and Northern Parliament fleets, aren't you?<br>
I'll tell you right now, they're both actually here. Naval HQ greenlit this operation.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z2：</span><br>
Have they? That explains it.<br>
I see some of our forces are gearing up for battle. Are we not here simply to stall for time?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Not quite. When push comes to shove, you need to be ready to fight back.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z2：</span><br>
Then allow me to transfer the recon data we've gathered. It should arrive in time.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Don't. You have to save it for after at least a skirmish has broken out.<br>
They've assembled a massive fleet, you know. We need to show them we mean business too.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z2：</span><br>
I don't like it when you use the phrase "mean business"... Should I start writing my will?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Not today. I promise to keep you safe, Z2.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z2：</span><br>
Please extend that promise to my little Lebe. In fact, to our entire fleet, if you would.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
I'm already doing my best to keep the Azur Lane at bay through radar jamming.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z2：</span><br>
They'll see through the jamming as soon as they get close. What's more, I dare say you're going overkill with it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Sure, they'll see through it, but then it's too late. Besides, overkill is the way to go when stalling for time.<br>
While they scramble to work around the jamming... Bam, that's when we strike. Then we have a shot at winning.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z2：</span><br>
So that's the plan... I cannot deny it is sound, at least in theory.<br>
You're sortieing too, aren't you? What is your target? Surely not the Commander's personal fleet, I hope.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Please, why would I be? The Commander's our guest.<br>
(Our next operation will run into difficulties if we commit too much to this one. But if we don't commit enough, we can expect Naval HQ to keep a watchful eye on us...)<br>
Tell you what – we'll go for the Northern Parliament's fleet.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z2：</span><br>
Very well then. I assume we have no other choice anyway.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
You assume correctly.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z2：</span><br>
As I tend to do... If we must fight, so be it, but please try not to aggravate them too much.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Don't worry, I can't even if I wanted to. It's my job to keep adjusting the frequency on this little jammer.<br>

<br>
Inside the Singularity - Mirror Sea<br>
The Iron Blood ships were the backbone of this new combined fleet. Led by Zuikaku's planes, they set out to sea in search of Sirens.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
This is Zuikaku. Sirens spotted, 10 o'clock! They'll be on us momentarily!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Seydlitz：</span><br>
Thank you kindly, Lady Zuikaku!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Don't mention it – I'm here to help!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Seydlitz：</span><br>
Then I have all the more reason to thank you!<br>
Replotting course. We shall cut in diagonally and attack from their side!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lützow：</span><br>
So these are the kinds of tactics a carrier employs. Neato.<br>
Let's see you try to sink more tonnage than my main guns can, though!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
The enemy force consists only of mass-produced ships. No humanoid Sirens!<br>
Should be good for a warmup! Just don't get too cocky because these are Mark II's.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Thüringen：</span><br>
Mark II's? Is that their official designation?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Yeah? Why do you ask?<br>
Are they the same model that attacked Scapa Flow, by any chance?<br>
...Never mind, I'm dumb. Mark II's didn't start appearing until waaay after Scapa Flow.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Elbing：</span><br>
How can you tell they're Mark II's? Is it the blue, glowing patterns on their hulls...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Yup! That means they have reinforced armor, which... Oh, that explains why regular warships couldn't damage them.<br>
Even modern mass-produced ships would struggle with these Sirens...<br>
It wouldn't even be a fight if we pitted the warships of Scapa Flow against them... It'd be a one-sided slaughter.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lützow：</span><br>
Well, if the records are right, those warships DID manage to sink one or two Siren vessels.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
But how?! They couldn't even break through their armor!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Seydlitz：</span><br>
With sheer willpower, training, and most important of all, an unbending fighting spirit. That is what I believe.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
I... I can believe that. You can overcome numbers and equipment with enough determination...<br>
It's as Mikasa once said... On-paper stats aren't what's important – your will to fight is.<br>
That's how you overcame the trials of the first great war. Not thanks just to strength, but also with a desire to protect humanity and its seas!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lützow：</span><br>
Yeah, but that wasn't exactly us. Thank the people who actually fought in that war.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
(I wonder if Akagi and Kaga ended up the way they did because they lost their way – and their will to fight...)<br>
Listen! These Sirens are pushovers for shipgirls like us! They don't stand a chance against our riggings!<br>
So go and give 'em hell!<br>

<br>
KABOOOM!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lützow：</span><br>
Direct hit! Damn, I'm good.<br>
Fighting with a rigging is pretty fun, actually.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Thüringen：</span><br>
All the power of a warship compressed into a weapon on the scale of a human...<br>
With a rigging, a single soldier can accomplish what once took an entire crew to do.<br>
It's no wonder that shipgirls made warships obsolete.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lützow：</span><br>
Plus, we're way smaller targets, so they're gonna miss most shots.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Thüringen：</span><br>
Yes, but that doesn't mean you should make like a sitting duck.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lützow：</span><br>
I'm cool with being a sitting duck if it can't hit me regardless.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Seydlitz：</span><br>
......<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yorck：</span><br>
What's the matter, Seydlitz?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Seydlitz：</span><br>
It's just... As I was calibrating my main guns, it dawned on me that it will be a long while before I master my rigging.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yorck：</span><br>
Want some help with that? Heavy cruisers and battlecruisers must have at least a few attributes in common.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Seydlitz：</span><br>
Yes, please! First of all, if you could look at this...<br>
<br>
KABOOOM!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Elbing：</span><br>
I... I hit the target?<br>
I sank it, too?! How in the world did my peashooter cannons manage that...?<br>
Oh, it must be because of my wish that I wouldn't land any successful hits. Thank goodness...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Seydlitz：</span><br>
It wasn't a fluke, Elbing. You've simply become stronger.<br>
Put your faith in yourself and your rigging, and you'll realize your full potential.<br>
I believe in you. These insignificant Sirens are no match for you!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yorck：</span><br>
Enemy planes on the horizon! Ready your anti-air weapons!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lützow：</span><br>
Planes, eh? Time to put this baby's AA capabilities to the test!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Thüringen：</span><br>
Ditto. The more acquainted we become with our arsenals, the better.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Elbing：</span><br>
I-I think I should just fall back...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Seydlitz：</span><br>
There is no need to, Elbing! Get behind me!<br>
<br>
KABOOOM!<br>
The aircraft dropped their payloads over Seydlitz, but only scored near misses. Her allies trained their AA guns on the planes and promptly shot them down.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Seydlitz：</span><br>
Enemy aircraft neutralized! Excellent. Now I also have a good idea of what our armor can withstand.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Emden：</span><br>
Why weather the enemy's attacks when one can evade them?<br>
<br>
The Swan of the East gracefully moved out of the way of incoming machine-gun fire, then retaliated with attacks of her own.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lützow：</span><br>
Wow, look at you. You've already become a pro at this.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Emden：</span><br>
"Emden's strength is not to be scoffed at, Lützow."<br>
We are a long way away from perfection, but an average battle poses no issue to us.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lützow：</span><br>
...You have it easy just 'cause there's two of you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Emden：</span><br>
If you have something you wish to say, speak up and look us in the eye.<br>
"And if you've the time for that, use it on fighting instead. Emden will not tolerate any laziness."<br>

<br>
A group of shipgirls watched from afar as the reborn warships practiced with their riggings.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Looks like they've gotten the hang of it. Taking out the small fry Sirens around here should be a breeze for them.<br>
Once that's done, I reckon we can start surveying the area beyond the anchorage.<br>
Then there's only one thing left to do – find out what that Siren superweapon was.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
(Friedrich has done it again...)<br>
(The power balance between the four big factions is at risk of collapsing entirely if the Iron Blood's forces keep growing at this rate.)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
...Akagi?<br>
Is there something on your mind?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
No, nothing in particular.<br>
Say, Zuikaku, have we ever needed to learn the very basics of our riggings?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Now that you mention it... No. We do study the specifics of new planes and gear and the like, but that's different.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
I long thought it impossible to directly compare Sakura Empire and Iron Blood riggings due to their design differences. It seems I was wrong.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Wrong? How so? Is there something unusual about theirs?<br>
They look in line with all other Iron Blood riggings I've seen before...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Think about it. Mikasa predates even those girls, but she never had to learn how to use her rigging.<br>
This is only speculation, but I see this as a strong indication that those girls were never meant to equip these riggings.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
Heheh. How perceptive you are.<br>
The notion that the Cube creates rigging based on a particular ship's hull is not entirely true. While this does occur in many instances, it is a guideline rather than a hard rule.<br>
We learned this through our research. All I've done here is put it to good use.<br>
Let me remind you, Akagi, that our rondo is still underway.<br>
Please be patient and see it to its conclusion. I assure you, you will not be disappointed.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
...Very well. I will do as you say and wait for the finale.<br>
(That's assuming Azur Lane doesn't show up and end her performance prematurely, anyway.)<br>
(The clock is ticking on the Singularity. Friedrich is wasting time on these frivolities...)<br>
......<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
......<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
......<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Why are you staring at me?<br>
You and I are both spectators here. I cannot speculate on what Friedrich's grand plan is.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
(Then there's Elizabeth... It'd be naive to think she's granting us access to Scapa Flow just out of the kindness of her heart.)<br>
(There must be something of greater importance to this place than what we've seen so far.)<br>
(I can only hope the Commander knows what that is... But if not...)<br>

KABOOOM!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Thüringen：</span><br>
Direct hit. We've broken up the Sirens' fleet.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yorck：</span><br>
Fascinating. It seems charging in is a valid strategy when you're a shipgirl.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lützow：</span><br>
Warships can do that too! Though they'll get lit up like a Christmas tree.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Thüringen：</span><br>
Speaking of which, we've only fought warship-sized Sirens thus far. Zuikaku mentioned "humanoid Sirens" in passing earlier.<br>
I imagine they're in a league of their own. Running and gunning like this will only work on small groups of big enemies.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Seydlitz：</span><br>
Should it come down to a point-blank fight with a human-sized adversary, my sword will come in handy!<br>
Even if all my shells are spent, I can keep fighting the Sirens!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lützow：</span><br>
Knock yourself out. Me, I'd just call it quits at that point.<br>
On another note, is anyone else curious how inter-faction relations have developed?<br>
Putting aside the obvious stuff anyone can infer, anyway.<br>
You reckon things are getting tense because of this operation they've got going?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Thüringen：</span><br>
It's safe to say there are at least two major camps: the Azur Lane and the Crimson Axis.<br>
The Azur Lane seems to be under Naval HQ's joint command, whereas the Iron Blood is the de-facto representative of the Crimson Axis.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lützow：</span><br>
Sooo... Which side is fighting the Sirens? They can't still be fighting among themselves, surely.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yorck：</span><br>
Both of them do. They have the same objective, but differ in how they aim to achieve it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Emden：</span><br>
That is human nature – to splinter off into groups that fight among each other.<br>
"However, they can achieve incredible things on the rare occasions they come together as one."<br>
"Taken as individuals, they are frail, powerless, and always yearning for stability."<br>
That's what makes them so sweet. Heehee...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lützow：</span><br>
Weird definition of "sweet," but you do you...<br>
Speaking of coming together, anyone else find it interesting how representatives from the Iron Blood, Sakura Empire, and Royal Navy are all in one place to do something other than fight?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Seydlitz：</span><br>
It is unusual, yes. Perhaps they've managed to purge the Sirens from their world... or they now face a threat even bigger than them?<br>
Either way, they deserve respect for all the battles they've fought leading up to today.<br>
Remember what Friedrich said – a shipgirl's duty is to wage war on the Sirens, not her own kind.<br>
We are soldiers, which is both our greatest strength and greatest flaw.<br>
Our forte is fighting, not unifying all of humanity. Only one person can reforge the Azur Lane of old...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Emden：</span><br>
The one known as the Commander.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Seydlitz：</span><br>
Indeed. All shipgirls, regardless of affiliation, are welcome under the Commandant's banner.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Emden：</span><br>
"To think a feeble human would be the key to a peaceful future."<br>
<br>
The Iron Blood shipgirls became more and more proficient at tracking and sinking Sirens as they accustomed to their new riggings.<br>
The former warships that were hunted down at Scapa Flow had now become the hunters.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Emden：</span><br>
I wish to see this Commander – my darling human – for myself. Heehee...<br>

<br>
The group's search for leads on the Siren superweapon had been fruitless. Worse yet, the gate to the Singularity would not last much longer.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Time is running out. How much longer until it closes, Zuikaku?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Don't worry, we have enough time. Though we should start getting ready to leave.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lützow：</span><br>
Hey, Friedrich. We're done.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
There you are. I take it the fighting was rejuvenating?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lützow：</span><br>
You bet. It was a great, fun workout!<br>
Until a point, anyway. Then it stopped being gratifying altogether.<br>
When victory comes too easily, fighting just becomes a chore, you know?<br>
Kind of feels like I'm making light of warship-me's efforts, too. "Look how easily I can beat these Sirens that annihilated you!"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
Don't feel that way. That other you did the best she could, just as you're doing now.<br>
It's pointless to measure the past by the standards of the present.<br>
Now... Do you feel ready to tackle a stronger adversary?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Seydlitz：</span><br>
Affirmative! Fighting in the name of humanity and the Iron Blood is my mission!<br>
Please, formally reintegrate us into the Iron Blood!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
There is no need to reintegrate you, because the Iron Blood never left you behind. <br>
You've always been with us, my children.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Emden：</span><br>
"How terribly sentimental for someone who is evidently manipulative."<br>
For the record, we are not your children.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
Then I won't call you that. All I wish to say is that anyone willing to fight for Iron Blood is family to me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
...This was your goal all along, wasn't it, Friedrich?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
Not quite. It wasn't my sole goal, simply one of them.<br>
These girls will serve the Iron Blood well, but they are only the prelude for the greater things to come.<br>
You've been with me on this journey. You've seen the same things I have.<br>
Naval HQ's falsehoods. The truth we learned in this place. The infinite potential of Wisdom Cubes.<br>
The finale is yet to come, Akagi.<br>
And I promise, it will not disappoint you, or Her Majesty, or the people outside the Singularity... or my child.<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Georgia：</span><br>
All right, Commander. It's time for a mission briefing.<br>
Almost all our fleets across this entire ocean sector are engaging the Iron Blood.<br>
Though we greatly outnumber them, their jamming has thrown a wrench into our plan.<br>
Let me break it down fleet by fleet. Our fleet has mainly only encountered jamming and a few ghost fleets. They've not done too much to slow us down.<br>
The Northern Parliament's fleet was intercepted by the Iron Blood, so they're expected to arrive behind schedule.<br>
Lastly, New Jersey's fleet. Hers is also in the midst of trading shots with the Iron Blood.<br>
As for our rear guard... Iron Blood submarines have been ambushing them. That's one of the reasons our advance has been going slowly.<br>
All that is to say, while things are taking longer than expected, everything is going more or less as planned.<br>
...Wait, we just received new intel. Let's see here...<br>
Huh. Blips 26, 30, and 31 have been identified as fake targets. I'll remove them from our map.<br>
<br>
"Great, that's three we can rule out. How many more are there?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Georgia：</span><br>
71, in total.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："We have our work cut out for us, huh..."</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Georgia：</span><br>
Yup. Our recon planes can't identify them from afar either, thanks to their optical camouflage.<br>
The only way we can identify fake targets is by getting in close. Our planes would get promptly shot down if they tried that.<br>
<br>
"Worse yet, it's impossible to pinpoint their flagship fleet with this many blips on the map."<br>
"The Iron Blood knows their technology, and they're really making the most of it."<br>
"It doesn't change the fact our forces far eclipse theirs, though. Sooner or later, their plan is going to fall apart."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Georgia：</span><br>
Exactly. They're succeeding at slowing our advance, but they can't stop it without inflicting actual damage to us.<br>
Give it some time and we'll be able to counteract their jamming as well.<br>
<br>
"This all begs the question – why are they stalling us to begin with? Are they buying time for reinforcements?"<br>
"Or... Maybe this has something to do with Friedrich's request for information surrounding Wisdom Cubes. The one she made a while back."<br>
"But who knows. Cubes, Singularities, this whole thing... It's often a mystery what goes on inside her head."<br>
"Just thinking about it gives me a headache."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Communicator：</span><br>
BEEP BEEP BEEP!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Eldridge：</span><br>
Commander... Your communicator.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Georgia：</span><br>
If it's Naval HQ, let's hope they're not in a sour mood. Heh.<br>
<br>
I picked up the communicator, which made the screen before me flash with the caller's ID.<br>
"It's... Soyuz?"<br>

NA Ocean<br>
As Kronshtadt was leading the Northern Parliament's fleet forward, a familiar figure approached her from over the horizon.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Ah, Kronshtadt. What a pleasant surprise.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kronshtadt：</span><br>
Prinz Eugen? Why in the world are you here?<br>
First thing's first – we're on a mission. Come any closer and I'll shoot you.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Aww. You were a lot more friendly at our last drinking party.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kronshtadt：</span><br>
This isn't a social event, sweetie.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Fair enough, but who's to say we can't socialize a little? What are you doing here?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kronshtadt：</span><br>
My job. What else should I be doing?<br>
And don't say "drinking with me." That's not going to happen.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
A shame, because I'd love a beer. We could drink, chat, share faction secrets, and so on.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kronshtadt：</span><br>
I definitely wouldn't mind hearing a few Iron Blood secrets, but I'm staying sober.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
You're sounding like Kirov now. What's wrong with treating yourself?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kronshtadt：</span><br>
Nothing, but I'll pass on the alcohol. We could talk over dinner sometime, though.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Dinner would be nice, but I was hoping for a little... more. You've changed in the time you went MIA.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kronshtadt：</span><br>
As have you. I see you've worked your way up to the position of Friedrich's little errand girl.<br>
I would ask what your goal here is, but I know you won't give me a straight answer. Instead, let me give you something – a piece of advice.<br>
If you keep playing this game of lies and deception, you'll one day lose sight of the truth.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Spoken like a woman who's frustrated that her own deception always falls flat.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kronshtadt：</span><br>
Oh yeah? If you think you're so much better, let's see you try to deceive your way out of us taking you prisoner.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Hahahah! What, do you expect me to simply turn around and let you cuff me?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kronshtadt：</span><br>
If you want to do it the easy way, yes. The hard way entails us blasting you to bits first! Fire!<br>
<br>
KABOOOM!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kronshtadt：</span><br>
What?! The shots passed right through her?! Tsk, she's just a projection!<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Bingo. Thanks for letting me have some of your precious time, by the way.<br>
As much as this pains me, I have to create the conditions for an uphill battle for you girls.<br>
Odin! You're up!<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Odin：</span><br>
Very well. Energy levels at maximum...<br>
This is the end for you! Herteitr's Rolling Thunder!<br>

Scapa Flow - Harbor<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jintsuu：</span><br>
It's terribly quiet... And the Iron Blood's ships are nowhere to be seen.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
Ägir and August von Parseval will remain behind as well then. If the Azur Lane comes, you know what to do.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jintsuu：</span><br>
Friedrich said they'd be here. The fact they aren't makes me think they were diverted to the frontlines.<br>
I was under the impression this wasn't our fight. Perhaps soon it will be, though...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yamashiro：</span><br>
Well, Akagi did give us orders to back you up if the Azur Lane shows up!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yukikaze：</span><br>
You should've brought Yukikaze the Great along! Then this stroke of bad luck would've never happened!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shoukaku：</span><br>
Have you still not heard anything from Zuikaku?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kaga：</span><br>
She's with Akagi. No harm will come to her as long as the Azur Lane doesn't reach us.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shoukaku：</span><br>
Given how the situation is developing, that's not very reassuring... If the Iron Blood deployed their forces to the frontlines, things must be quite dire.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kaga：</span><br>
I see your point. Though there's still a fair distance between us and the fighting, my recon planes are already picking up smoke clouds.<br>
They're headed straight for us, that much is clear. What I can't say is whether or not they know we are here.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shoukaku：</span><br>
Maybe they hope to ascertain the Royal Navy's intentions? None of their faction leaders know about their involvement in this operation.<br>
...Either way, I'll do as Akagi said and head there.<br>
Let's just hope the Sakura Empire won't need to join the fight today.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kaga：</span><br>
Got it. I'll let Akagi know you–<br>
<br>
All of a sudden, the placid Singularity roared. A beam of light burst out from its gateway.<br>
The energy spike made the water's surface boil. Amid the steam, a figure clad in a red kimono descended.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kaga：</span><br>
Akagi?! Are you all right? How are things beyond the gate?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
I'm fine, as is Zuikaku. We just got done witnessing something very, very interesting.<br>
Though now's not the time to talk about it. That comes later.<br>
I see you and Jintsuu are the only ones here... The Azur Lane has made a move, hasn't it?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kaga：</span><br>
Correct. They're headed for us right now.<br>
The Iron Blood is employing stalling tactics, but it's only a matter of time before they'll reach us.<br>
Shoukaku just said she's on the way. If we're lucky, we can escape before the Azur Lane arrives.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Escape? Don't be ridiculous. Everything is going exactly according to plan.<br>
You've done well, guarding the gate, but now it's time for us to join the fight.<br>
I know you think I sound crazy. We're outnumbered and seemingly have our backs against the wall...<br>
To which I say – it's a good thing we made some new friends inside the Singularity.<br>
<br>
Akagi gestured towards the gateway to dispel Kaga's confusion.<br>
Zuikaku was first to return, then Friedrich, then Queen Elizabeth... Everyone who had entered was back.<br>
But then came the party of Iron Blood ships given new life. As the last one exited, the gate faded into specks of nothingness.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kaga：</span><br>
Are they... META ships?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
No. They are ordinary shipgirls like us.<br>
Friedrich needed more cards in her hand to accomplish the true goal of this operation. Now she has them.<br>

Northern Parliament Control Center - Commanding Vessel<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Georgia：</span><br>
Commander, I've come to update you on the situation.<br>
Soyuz's fleet is in the midst of encircling Scapa Flow, as planned.<br>
New Jersey's fleet is also on the move, but progress is still slow owing to Iron Blood's jamming and stalling tactics.<br>
Speaking of the Iron Blood, we've caught wind of the fact they're fielding blueprint ships.<br>
Most of them are under Ulrich's command. She seems to be making a beeline for this very fleet.<br>
Our forces are spread out because of all the jamming, so stopping Ulrich's fleet in its tracks will be difficult.<br>
But, if they do reach us, we can deal with them just fine. You're with us, after all.<br>
<br>
"Sounds like whatever they do, it won't be enough to turn the battle in their favor."<br>
"Just earlier, I heard Iron Blood planes have been spotted as well. I'll notify Enterprise's reserve fleet to be on their guard."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Georgia：</span><br>
The fact they're fielding blueprint ships now has me a bit wary, though...<br>
<br>
"You're right to be. Every faction voiced concerns over blueprint ships as this operation was being drafted, too. Soyuz insisted there wouldn't be any."<br>
"One of her informants had said so. Allegedly. Looking back at it now, she might just have been bluffing for the sake of getting the operation approved..."<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："Have you heard anything from the Royal Navy?"</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Georgia：</span><br>
You mean regarding Scapa Flow? They're still dancing around the subject.<br>
One minute they say they can't get in touch with anyone at the base, the next they say it's largely irrelevant to the operation at hand.<br>
Curiously, Her Majesty has also been telling us not to worry about it.<br>
All signs point toward an Iron Blood invasion, but then why is the Royal Navy being so uncooperative? Scapa Flow is still an important base to them.<br>
If they wanted to hide something from us, it'd be the ideal location for it, too.<br>
<br>
"An invasion does seem like the likeliest answer. If this operation is intended as a retaliatory attack against the Iron Blood, why are we headed for a Royal Navy anchorage?"<br>
"And for that matter, why would the Iron Blood attack Scapa Flow to begin with?"<br>
"Friedrich and Elizabeth will both have some explaining to do the next time I see them."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Georgia：</span><br>
Guess we'll have to find out for ourselves...<br>
Sorry for changing topics, but would you let me deal with Ulrich's fleet, Commander?<br>
Your fleet is more than enough to handle hers, but that would take time, and we've been stalled long enough as it is.<br>
I just need a few others to come with me. We'll head out and intercept Ulrich's blueprint brigade to ensure you have a clear path to Scapa Flow.<br>
We've identified the majority of the blips on the map by now, and if Friedrich's anywhere, she should be in the harbor.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："All right. Permission granted to sortie."</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2："Do it, and treat yourself to an Oxy-cola."</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项3："One must wonder what Ulrich's goal is with all this..."</span>'''''<br>

Scapa Flow - Harbor<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yorck：</span><br>
Well, this scenery sure is different to the Mirror Sea.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lützow：</span><br>
No wrecks, no devastation, none of that stuff... Is this how Scapa Flow really looks?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Thüringen：</span><br>
The ruined Scapa Flow was only a fabrication from the past. This is the real – future – Scapa Flow.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lützow：</span><br>
Wow, so we're back to the future! I've always wanted to be a time traveler!<br>
Seriously though, you can't convince me we DIDN'T just travel through time.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Emden：</span><br>
Pray tell, did the Sirens attack this place recently? I see some signs of damage.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kaga：</span><br>
There was an attack, yeah, but it was orchestrated by the Iron Blood as part of a separate operation.<br>
In short, the Royal Navy was lured away from here while Tirpitz and Deutschland launched a surprise attack.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Emden：</span><br>
"Interesting. The Iron Blood has only gotten craftier with the passage of time."<br>
I look forward to meeting our compatriots from the future.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kaga：</span><br>
Compatriots? You mean the shipgirls allied in the fight against the Sirens, or the Crimson Axis – allied in the fight against the Azur Lane?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Emden：</span><br>
"Both."<br>
When the Iron Blood's navy turned to ashes, the Crimson Axis rose from them like a phoenix...<br>
"The losses suffered by the Iron Blood forced them to seek other alliances."<br>
A union created due to an external threat is highly unstable. When the external threat weakens, so does the union's cohesion.<br>
"The Crimson Axis being established as a result was only to be expected."<br>
Conflict is human nature. In the absence of conflict, humans will make enemies of each other.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kaga：</span><br>
So this is the High Seas Fleet's world view.<br>
Alliances are fluid. Yesterday's foes may be today's friends – and vice versa.<br>
Let us just hope that our alliance is long-lasting.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lützow：</span><br>
Hey, Zuikaku told me about you. You're... Kaga, was it?<br>
Ex-battleship turned carrier, just like Akagi, right?<br>
And Amagi, I think? Preeetty sure there were plans to convert her to a carrier.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kaga：</span><br>
Correct. As long as the hull is the same, you can change designations to a certain degree.<br>
However, it's not an efficient use of time or resources. None of the major factions do it often.<br>
(If Amagi was still here with us... I might've never been converted into a carrier.)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Seydlitz：</span><br>
Though I've been granted this rigging, the fact remains that I am an old warship. I thought it possible to become an asset in battle through training...<br>
Alas, what you're suggesting is that there are limits to what is possible.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kaga：</span><br>
You're already a great asset as far as I can tell.<br>
If there's anything you lack, it's plain old experience.<br>
And if you ever need to modify your equipment, Iron Blood technology makes that easy.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Seydlitz：</span><br>
Really? Then I think I'll ask Lady Friedrich for a few more main cannons!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kaga：</span><br>
I doubt that's going to happen.<br>
(Though, this is the Iron Blood we're talking about, so I could be wrong about that...)<br>
<br>
While Seydlitz and Kaga were exchanging words, Akagi interjected.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Zuikaku, have you seen Elizabeth?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Hey, yeah... I could've sworn she was with us a moment ago!<br>
Unless... Don't tell me she didn't make it through the Singularity in time...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
Her Majesty made it out, don't worry. She simply has other business to attend to.<br>
Besides, she cannot let herself be seen among our ranks during this operation. I had to let her go.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
A shame. She could've been an ace up your sleeve if you took her hostage.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
I've no need for another ace, Akagi.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
My, my. Your sleeves must be quite stuffed, then.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
What if I told you my hand was already a royal flush?<br>
The only question is how I'll put my cards on the table.<br>
Seeing as Ägir and August are absent, I assume everything is proceeding according to plan?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kaga：</span><br>
Seems so. We don't know if they're managing to keep the Azur Lane busy, though.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
That depends solely on how astute they – and my child – are.<br>
We are just the orchestra. Our task is simply to keep performing this rondo.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lützow：</span><br>
Sooo... What do we do now? Go beat up the Azur Lane and take their lunch money?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
You're free to fight as much as you like, if that's what you're asking.<br>
But before that, you should stock up on ammunition at Scapa Flow. You nearly expended every last shell inside the Mirror Sea.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Emden：</span><br>
Then replenish our ammunition we shall.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Thüringen：</span><br>
A shipgirl can't fight on an empty magazine, after all.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yorck：</span><br>
Don't mind if I do. You too, Elbing. Come along.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Elbing：</span><br>
Okay... I bet the ammo will be full of duds, and that my cannons will jam...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
You needn't reverse-jinx yourself, Elbing.<br>
You are strong and capable. Your friends all appreciate you. That is the truth, whether you believe it or not.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Elbing：</span><br>
Er...! S-sorry, I'd better hurry along...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lützow：</span><br>
Me too, probably. I'll have a quick nap while I'm at it.<br>
Wake me when the fighting starts.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Seydlitz：</span><br>
I shall see to it that she does! Please excuse us!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
What will the rest of you do? The Sakura Empire has no reason to be fighting this battle.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Perhaps not, but your rondo hasn't concluded yet, has it?<br>
So, I'd like to resupply as well. Do you mind?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
Not at all.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
I'm still good on supplies! I didn't do any fighting in that Mirror Sea.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
You may not have engaged in battle, but planes and engines don't power themselves.<br>
Restock on fuel while you can. It's free, so why pass on it?<br>
Think of it as a reward for your efforts, if that makes you feel any better.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Well... I don't really expect a reward.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
But you deserve one for your participation in this battle. You'll want to claim it in advance.<br>
You will serve us all – my child included – better with your fuel tank and magazines topped off.<br>
Go on. I insist.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Allow me to confirm it one last time. We are permitted to fight the Commander?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
Yes. You have my permission to do so.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Heheh... I look forward to seeing how this goes.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
Don't walk out during the intermission, Akagi.<br>
Everyone here shall witness this performance until its very end.<br>

Flagship Briefing Room - Near Scapa Flow<br>

<br>
"Um, thanks, Eldridge. I'll read the rest for myself, if you don't mind."<br>
A short while later...<br>
Based on the reports from all our fleets, it seemed the Iron Blood's strategy had changed.<br>
They had given up on their electronic interference and stalling tactics and instead rallied all their forces at Scapa Flow.<br>
Had our attacks put them on the back foot? Were they done trying to diverge our attention away from whatever they were hiding? Nobody knew.<br>
Kronshtadt's fleet had apparently engaged Odin, and they survived the battle without any major casualties.<br>
Georgia's fleet fought Ulrich's fleet and, incredibly, won. The former was now on its way back to regroup with us, while the latter broke off to retreat.<br>
Lastly, New Jersey's fleet defeated Tirpitz's fleet, but sustained minor damage after a battle with Ulrich's fleet as it was retreating.<br>
All in all, though the Iron Blood had fought admirably, they were still losing the battle.<br>
I still had no idea what Friedrich's goal was, but it seemed to me like her plan was going to be a bust.<br>
I kicked back in my seat, drew a sigh, and reviewed our fleets' statuses once more.<br>
Saratoga's reserve fleet had linked up with ours. I now commanded a very respectable fleet for the final battle.<br>
I had all the right cards in my hand. All I had to do was lay them on the table.<br>

<br>
Scapa Flow - Nearby Waters<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
Commander, we've located the remaining Iron Blood forces, as well as Friedrich herself.<br>
She seems to be leaving Scapa Flow's harbor and heading towards your flagship.<br>
<br>
Why is Akagi's fleet with them as well?<br>
And who are those new ships? Do they have something to do with Friedrich's real plans?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetskaya Rossiya：</span><br>
Comrade Commander... we are... arriving...<br>
<br>
A message from the Northern Parliament... but there was too much noise to hear its contents properly. Didn't the Iron Blood just stop their jamming efforts?<br>
"Eldridge, check on the status of our communication equipment."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Eldridge：</span><br>
All equipment is... normal... No problems in the flagship––<br>
<br>
I was afraid as much. That could only mean one thing...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Seems like the bad feeling in my gut was right. The Sirens have started to make their move.<br>
<br>
"I thought we taught them a lesson for good during Operation Siren, but I guess that's a bit too optimistic..."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Where did all these guys come from? We're in trouble, Commander!<br>
We're not just against one Siren fleet! My readings are showing multiple outbreaks of Mirror Seas!<br>
The Northern Parliament fleet seems to be the first group to be affected! I'm going to have to check in on the other fleets' situation!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
A heavy fog is starting to spread across the water! Commander, I'd advise you to keep all our fleets together!<br>
Stay where you are! We're coming to regroup with you right now!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
It's gotten to us too! We've already lost contact with a reserve fleet!<br>
I'm not sure we'll be able to get to your position, but I'm trying my best!<br>
<br>
"I don't like the idea of grouping everyone in one place. Prioritize your own safety first and protect the carriers to maintain our visibility!"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Washington：</span><br>
Understood! We'll correct course.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Baltimore：</span><br>
Damnit... We're trying to make it back to the carriers but a swarm of humanoid Sirens showed up! This might take us a while!<br>
<br>
The sudden appearance of the Sirens disrupted all the fleets as they tried to converge on Scapa Flow.<br>
Our communication network was in tatters, but I tried to group nearby fleets together as best as I could, focusing on working our way through the fog one piece at a time.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
How is possible for so many Mirror Seas to erupt when we've continuously had so many patrols and recons over this area?<br>
Did they anticipate for all of this to happen?!<br>
<br>
"Stay calm, Memphis. Contact the nearest Royal Navy base immediately. We need air support, as much as they can spare."<br>
"If they have any fleets available, ask that they dispatch them immediately."<br>
"These are their waters after all. Surely they have to have some patrols in the area."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Understood, I'll forward your message to them right away!<br>
<br>
"Georgia, how's the situation on your end?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Georgia：</span><br>
Good enough, Commander. I can still hear you.<br>
According to Enterprise's previous reports, the appearance of this sea fog likely signifies the presence of the high-level Siren, Compiler.<br>
If we can locate and defeat her, that will most likely cause the fog to disperse.<br>
<br>
The fog heavily limited the range and scope of our carrier-based recons. Clearing the fog naturally is high priority.<br>
"Enterprise, Saratoga, can you hear me?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Communicator：</span><br>
.........<br>
<br>
"It's no good. Seems like the fog is also jamming our equipment."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">New Jersey：</span><br>
Carriers are great and all, but don't forget you still have the indomitable Black Dragon at your side~♪<br>
Missed me, Commander? How are you holding up over there?<br>
<br>
A lively voice echoed through the briefing room.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">New Jersey：</span><br>
We've lost contact with about half our fleet, but I brought the other half with me!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Essex：</span><br>
I'll find out where Compiler is hiding! I'm going to do my part for the fleet!<br>
<br>
"That's going to be the first step if we want to figure out exactly what we're up against."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">New Jersey：</span><br>
Psst... Commander, I saw a mass-produced Iron Blood fleet on my way here...<br>
But the Sirens weren't attacking them at all. Only us.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："Does that mean they're working together...?"</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2："Don't jump to conclusions right away..."</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">New Jersey：</span><br>
I can't say for sure, but the evidence does point in that direction.<br>
Granted, the Sirens sometimes have objectives of their own, but I'd urge you to stay on your guard.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Intrepid：</span><br>
Commander! We've located a humanoid Siren that appears to be Compiler!<br>
She's leading a massive fleet towards your direction from the southeast! Wait... is that Friedrich's fleet coming from the northeast?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">New Jersey：</span><br>
I'll take care of the Sirens! Commander, make sure you give Friedrich a thorough talking-to!<br>
I won't let you anywhere near the Commander, Siren scum!!<br>
<br>
.........<br>
I had long prepared for the possibility of the Sirens interfering during this operation.<br>
I assembled a coalition, and even tapped into the Sea of Stars.<br>
But with the wild card of Friedrich der Große thrown in, it seems that my preparations were not thorough enough...<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Eldridge：</span><br>
Commander... the communicator...<br>
<br>
I kept my channels open with my allies in the area such as Memphis and New Jersey, but didn't notice any incoming messages.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Eldridge：</span><br>
...A secret line.<br>
<br>
A secret line? At a time like this?<br>
The sender's name is anonymous, but the only person I can imagine doing this is...<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："Sovetsky Soyuz?"</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2："Friedrich der Große."</span>'''''<br>

<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Yes, my child.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
Or should I use a more formal title, Commander of the Azur Lane?<br>
I am Friedrich der Große of the Iron Blood. We meet at last.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："This is a private line. It's strictly––"</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2："Why are you contacting me now of all times?"</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''...Inaccessible by the Naval HQ, yes?<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Because it's a good time to make idle chatter. Hehe.<br>
<br>
There are too many questions that I have for you.<br>
But if this is a procrastination tactic, I'm afraid it's not going to work.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
Indeed. You have a Siren problem on your hand, and I have come here to offer you a solution.<br>
But as the champion who eliminated the Sirens from the NA Ocean, you'll have to stay awhile to listen to my story first.<br>
Why are the Sirens able to materialize such a massive strike force out of thin air?<br>
<br>
"Aren't you working with them to orchestrate this ambush...?"<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
Even if we have a bit more knowledge of the Sirens than the other factions, it is impossible to "orchestrate" anything with them.<br>
But what is true... is that our cooperation with the Sirens is a part of why they chose to emerge here and now.<br>
<br>
.........<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
You already know this, don't you? Every faction is connected to the Sirens to some extent through the Naval HQ.<br>
You mobilized more ships than what Sovetsky Soyuz's plan called for because you anticipated the Siren threat.<br>
Why are the Sirens still able to emerge in such large numbers after being thoroughly defeated in the NA Ocean?<br>
The answer is simple – the NA Ocean never meant anything to the Sirens.<br>
"Operation Siren" –– the Siren "base" that you captured, was never a base in the first place.<br>
It was nothing more than a watchtower of sorts to prevent the Ashes from intervening in this world.<br>
<br>
"Actually, we had a bit of outside help too."<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
The true power of the Sirens vastly eclipses what any of us thought. Whether it be Bismarck, you, or myself.<br>
All those high-ranking Sirens: Observer, Purifier, Tester, Omitter, Compiler...<br>
Compiler is capable of constructing an entire experimental site, complete with Siren facilities and Mirror Seas.<br>
Omitter conducts field tests of experimental weapons, as well as carries out repairs and upgrades.<br>
Tester adjusts the individual performance of humanoid Sirens, oversees Reenactments, and determines where the Sirens will intervene.<br>
Purifier is tasked with cleansing "impurities" from their testing grounds... and has long been the face of what we consider to be a formidable enemy.<br>
Observer manages and directs the Sirens' experimentation, summarizing their results and sharing data between terminals.<br>
Yet all of these Sirens are research programs made for monitoring and managing the "experiments" of this world. In other words, they are non-combatants as far as the Sirens are concerned.<br>
After all, who else would interact with the guinea pigs of their experiments?<br>
The Sirens' true combat models are the Arbiters. They boast powers that defy our imagination.<br>
<br>
"In other words, the Arbiters have been fighting against..."<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
Yes, the Ashes. Or perhaps, "META" would be more accurate?<br>
The Sirens consider META to be a failed product of cognitive awakening, refuse that has escaped from the experimental site.<br>
Their existences are nothing more than taints to the experiment, and therefore must be destroyed.<br>
And thus, Observer Zero began to move. An entity that even the Arbiters bow to.<br>
With the arrival of the Ashes, the Sirens will be able to directly interfere in this world.<br>
And the proof of the Ashes' advent in our world... are the Singularities.<br>
We all seek peace and a better tomorrow, my child. And your "victory" in the NA Ocean may have seemed like a step in that direction, but is that really so?<br>
When the Sirens choose to move the world with their instruments of war, thusly the world moves.<br>
When the Sirens choose to direct the future of the world, thusly bends our very fate.<br>
When the Sirens choose to let us have peace, thusly shall we know peace by their whims alone.<br>
When the Sirens choose to have us wage war, thusly shall we submit to their machinations.<br>
How is it possible that the Iron Blood, ravaged and destitute from the last great war, would ascend over the other factions technologically in such a short period of time?<br>
How is it possible that the Northern Parliament, stretched thin and driven to desperation, would emerge with the mighty Polar Fleet? Or the "storm" that would end the conflict in the East?<br>
The reason is the same – the Sirens chose these things.<br>
The Sirens seek to create an experimental site where they reign over us as gods, where we live and die only for their purposes.<br>
And that is a world where shipgirls and humans alike... need not exist.<br>
<br>
(Friedrich's words struck me again and again like rushing waves. Some of those things I had heard before, others were completely new to me. Some of these things I knew to be true, others I could hardly suspend my disbelief.)<br>
(For a person who has never let others see any cracks in her composure, her voice was burning with both passion and resentment.)<br>
(At this moment, I was suddenly struck with a sense of guilt for suspecting that a person like this would be colluding with the Sirens at all.)<br>
(Not just her, but also Prinz Eugen, Bismarck, and everyone in the Iron Blood... We were all just struggling to survive against insurmountable odds.)<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
Now, this world is under the control of the Sirens. They dictate what shall be written into the annals of history.<br>
If the Sirens never existed... could you fathom what our world would look like?<br>
<br>
"...A world without the Sirens..."<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
It could well be a wretched place filled with suffering...<br>
But at least it would be one where we can create the future we desire, with human hands.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Commander! It's an emergency! Someone's cut into the communication line!<br>
I didn't think it was possible to break through the Sirens' jamming, but––<br>
<br>
"...This voice...!"<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Communicator：</span><br>
I am Bismarck, flagship of the Iron Blood. Listen to me, all members of the Iron Blood present at Scapa Flow!<br>
Starting from now, the Iron Blood shall launch a full-scale offensive against the Sirens! We shall sever any and all lingering ties to them!<br>
Restructure your fleets to cooperate with the ships in your respective locales, and work with the Azur Lane to defeat the Siren threat!<br>
And to you, Commander... I'm sorry I kept you waiting all this time.<br>
Let us put an end to this, and fight together as a unified Azur Lane!<br>
From now, we will choose our own destiny!<br>
<br>
I found myself lost for words. Bismarck, who had been engulfed by the darkness of Siren technology, was standing once more.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Prinz Eugen's fleet has already started to exchange fire with the Sirens!<br>
But what in the world is going on?! I thought Bismarck sunk way back when...<br>
That's not important though... I'm just glad we can fight together against the Sirens!<br>
I just hope everyone got the message since we've been tied up by the Sirens' jamming.<br>
Commander, everyone in the Azur Lane is counting on you to lead us into battle!<br>
<br>
"It'll be difficult to coordinate several different fleets, especially with this dense fog. But..."<br>
"For now, keep your distance from the Iron Blood ships and work together to attack the Sirens!"<br>
(Bismarck's proclamation should've been heard by the other fleets as well, but I wanted to minimize any chances of friendly fire.)<br>
(The best way to do that is to keep the fleets out of each others' line of sight and focus their firepower on the Sirens from different angles.)<br>
"I'll give you further instructions after I see how the other fleets are responding."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Alright, I'll pass the word on to New Jersey.<br>
Some of our fleets are breaking out of the Mirror Seas as well, so I'll make sure they're updated too!<br>
<br>
"Now... What exactly is going on, Friedrich?"<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
It is as you see, my child.<br>
We used ourselves as bait to gather the fleets of the world.<br>
We utilized the Naval HQ's own Reenactment against them, opening a Singularity at Scapa Flow right under their noses.<br>
And now, with the return of Bismarck, I shall resume my position in the front lines, assisting the Azur Lane in defeating the Siren threat.<br>
This was my plan – as well as my way of rolling out the red carpet for Bismarck.<br>
With the sound of my cannons, the Iron Blood shall now be free from the Sirens' curse.<br>
Now the question remains, my child: What shall your next move be?<br>
<br>
.........<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："The same thing it's always been."</span>'''''<br>

<span style="color:#ffd000;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
How I've wished to witness your leadership with my own two eyes, my child, Commander of Azur Lane.<br>
But there is something I must attend to first. Best of luck to you.<br>

<br>
Scapa Flow - Nearby Waters<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Akagi：</span><br>
So Bismarck returns to formally declare war against the Sirens...<br>
Was this your trump card, Friedrich?<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
No, this was always Bismarck's will... For she is no card, but rather the dealer.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Akagi：</span><br>
Quite a refreshing turn of events compared to the usual plotting. Do you have any idea what it means to turn against the Sirens?<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
Of course. But it is the path the Iron Blood must walk.<br>
Naturally, the Sakura Empire is not obligated to follow us down this path.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Emden：</span><br>
"Hehehe... How lucky we are to witness such a thrilling show just after waking up."<br>
Yes, I'm glad that I'm here to witness this.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Thüringen：</span><br>
If you want to see the course of history change with your own eyes, you'll have to stay alive though.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Lützow：</span><br>
I don't even know what's going on anymore. Weren't we gearing up to fight the Azur Lane just a moment ago?<br>
Was that all a ruse then? Our only enemies are the Sirens, yeah?<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
Why, did you want to try your hand against the Azur Lane?<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Lützow：</span><br>
Nah, I don't have anything against them. Whatever lets me go back to sleep sooner.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Seydlitz：</span><br>
While the Crimson Axis and Azur Lane have ideological differences, those are nothing in comparison to the existential threat posed by the Sirens.<br>
The single enemy of all humanity has always been clear.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Yorck：</span><br>
Hehe. In that case, shall we make sure to pay one back for our warship predecessors?<br>
Taking these Sirens down should be worth a lot more than those small fries back in the Mirror Sea.<br>
It'll be exciting to hunt down stronger enemies. Don't you agree, Elbing?<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Elbing：</span><br>
I-I don't think I'll ever be able to beat the Sirens... I'm just gonna drag everyone down and be a hindrance...<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Yorck：</span><br>
That sounds like you're ready to go to me! You heard it, Friedrich. Lead us into battle!<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
None of you are obligated to follow me.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Emden：</span><br>
Will you direct me to my enemies?<br>
"Yes, tell us who we are to flay."<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
A high-ranking Siren by the name of Compiler. She is the one responsible for the weather anomalies here.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Lützow：</span><br>
Going straight for the enemy's head, huh? A daring strategy – I like it!<br>
Oh, looks like the Azur Lane is starting to make their move too. Let's pick up the pace, or we'll get left behind!<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
Indeed. Let us begin our attack.<br>
August, Ägir, proceed to the next phase of the plan.<br>
You two have another goal other than simply defeating the Sirens here.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Ägir：</span><br>
Understood. I didn't expect you to come back so soon.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">August von Parseval：</span><br>
The gateway to the Singularity, yes? Leave it to me.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Kaga：</span><br>
Akagi, what are we going to do now?<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Akagi：</span><br>
We'll follow the Iron Blood for now. But don't stick your head out unless we're under attack.<br>
That goes especially for you, Zuikaku.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
H-hey, what's that supposed to mean...<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

<br>
By the time I led my forces to Compiler's location, Friedrich's fleet was already engaged in combat with the high-ranking Siren.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
You sure took your sweet time, my child, even though you were originally closer than us.<br>
<br>
"A lot of our forces were still regrouping from the various Mirror Seas."<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
Still, I must applaud your courage for personally joining us on the front lines.<br>
<br>
"Don't worry about me. I know my way around the battlefield."<br>
"Besides, I can't let the Iron Blood hog all the glory."<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Emden：</span><br>
"I see... So this soft, fragile human is the Commander."<br>
We are Emden. It is a pleasure to meet you, hehehe...<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
Having that said, it is too dangerous for you to directly face a high-ranking Siren. Allow us to handle this.<br>
<br>
"I understand your concerns, but I'll also be able to lead better when I'm in the thick of things."<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
A fair point.<br>
My friends, this will be your first time facing a high-ranking Siren. How are you all feeling?<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Lützow：</span><br>
Dunno... She's pretty cute. Like, wouldn't mind bringing her back home.<br>
Think we can keep her?<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
Did you forget what happened the last time you tried to capture a Siren?<br>
And though they might look a bit like us, they are far different from shipgirls or humans.<br>
They are capable of transferring their consciousness between vessels, often discarding their former vessels with... destructive means.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Lützow：</span><br>
That thing has a self-destruct button? Maybe I don't want her after all...<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
Good. Stay focused on the fight.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Lützow：</span><br>
Actually, this whole thing sounds like a pain in the ass. Can I take back what I said earlier and go back to sleep instead?<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Compiler ：</span><br>
.........<br>
<br>
"Don't be fooled by her appearance. She's a well-rounded combatant with an inexhaustible arsenal of weapons."<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
It is as my child says. It takes an entire fleet to stand up to a high-ranking Siren intent on destroying us.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Seydlitz：</span><br>
That's fine by me... A prime opportunity to test our mettle.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
Additionally, we don't know how powerful this Compiler model is.<br>
Stay focused, and don't take any unnecessary risks.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Seydlitz：</span><br>
Understood. We'll advance carefully.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Compiler ：</span><br>
The Iron Blood's defection was calculated as inevitable. But why now?<br>
...Tester's sabotage. An increasing number of errors in recent calculations.<br>
Your actions are illogical. The Iron Blood will fail to maximize its benefits.<br>
Why are you doing this?<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
We aren't interested in maximizing benefits. We're interested in getting rid of you, and now is the best time to do it.<br>
You should know by now that humans are unpredictable creatures. Theory and logic will only get you so far.<br>
We were modeled after humans, and have a far better grasp of human emotions than your kind does.<br>
So we will use what we were given, while working around what we weren't. Is that hard to understand?<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Compiler ：</span><br>
Instability is the result of actions informed by emotion.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
Cooperating with Soyuz and Queen Elizabeth. Avoiding the Naval HQ's suspicions. Opening a Singularity. Making contact with the Ashes. The actions of the Commander. And Bismarck's will––<br>
All of these were gambles. And I've won them all.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Compiler ：</span><br>
Incomprehensible.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
Of course you can't understand. You're just a program after all, not a person.<br>
...Perhaps your next vessel will be updated with better comprehension skills.<br>
Prepare yourself, Compiler. We're coming for you.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Seydlitz：</span><br>
All cannons, fire! Everyone, this is our chance to rid ourselves of our past regrets!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Commander, the Iron Blood fleet has begun attacking!<br>
<br>
"Let's not keep them waiting then."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetskaya Rossiya：</span><br>
Comrade Commander! The Northern Parliament's Polar Fleet has linked up with the Azur Lane's flagship fleet!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tallinn：</span><br>
Phew... We made it just in the nick of time.<br>
<br>
The ships scattered throughout the area rallied behind Bismarck's momentous declaration.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
We've managed to rescue the remainder of our forces from the Mirror Seas as well. We're now ready to send air support at any time!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
Sister Sara's good to go too! You can use my air wing any time you want!<br>
Oh, the Sakura Empire's fleet is here too?<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Akagi：</span><br>
We have our own plans. Sorry, but we'll only be offering air support for your battle.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
Hmm... Well, we should still have more than enough firepower to take down Compiler!<br>
<br>
"Everyone, our target is Compiler. Bring her down!"<br>

<br>
Equipped with heavy armor, layers of defensive barriers, and powerful regeneration abilities, Compiler is one of the most durable high-ranking Sirens.<br>
However, that only means anything against a normal-sized fleet.<br>
Faced with a relentless barrage, the combined forces were able to break through her barriers much faster than she was able to regenerate them.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Emden：</span><br>
"Weren't your defenses supposed to be impenetrable? What happened to that? Ahahaha!"<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Lützow：</span><br>
Now, to pry apart that armor of yours~<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Seydlitz：</span><br>
I'll admit, she's incredibly resilient, but there's no way she'll be able to repair all this damage in time.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Yorck：</span><br>
But we still have to watch out for her pesky attacks... Especially those damn tentacles!<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Elbing：</span><br>
Those tentacles are going to mess me up and do unspeakable things to me... I already know it...<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Thüringen：</span><br>
Even a high-spec Siren like her won't be able to do a thing against the combined might of all us shipgirls.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Those new Iron Blood ships seem like they're doing way more damage to her barriers than we are!<br>
<br>
"You're right. Those barriers that completely negate attacks from other ships are getting ripped apart by Emden's attacks."<br>
"Wait... Is Compiler unable to adapt to their attacks?"<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Compiler ：</span><br>
Warning: Barrier module damaged. Energy charger overheating. Unable to sustain repairs.<br>
Warning: Armor destroyed. Damage to core module imminent.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Georgia：</span><br>
This is the end of the line for you, Compiler. You and your fleet are going straight back to the abyss you came from!<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Lützow：</span><br>
Are we going to score a total victory here?<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Compiler ：</span><br>
No... This is just the beginning.<br>
Deviation from experimental values has risen to a dangerous threshold.<br>
The reset sequence must be activated.<br>
The reset sequence must be activated...<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
You won't be able to do that.<br>
For you, your body is just another meaningless vessel. No matter how many times you fail, no matter how many times you're destroyed, you will be reborn again and again.<br>
By using the reset sequence, you might be able to destroy and recreate this Mirror Sea...<br>
But what if this place also houses your program's mainframe?<br>
What would happen to your data?<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Compiler ：</span><br>
This place is...?! How did you...<br>
How?! Why?! Without the Sirens, you––<br>
<br>
KABOOOM!<br>
Countless shells rained down on Compiler, the vessel falling silent after her consciousness is transferred away.<br>
.........<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："Why didn't you let her finish?"</span>'''''<br>

<span style="color:#ffd000;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>

Ägir, August, you know what to do. Blow the gateway wide open.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">August von Parseval：</span><br>
I shall see to it. Friedrich, evacuate everyone away from the gate.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Ägir：</span><br>
If you get caught in its path, it'll cleave you in two.<br>
<br>
"You're going to 'blow it wide open'?"<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
Quite literally. We will stretch the very fabric of the Mirror Sea and bring Compiler's mainframe to us.<br>
Now... Your attention, please. It is time to play the final movement.<br>

<br>
A massive burst of energy shot forth from the gateway at Scapa Flow.<br>
The entrance through the Mirror Sea expanded, turning into a huge glowing archway that reached into the skies.<br>
Beyond the archway was a whole other dimension, more foreign than anything I'd seen before.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">New Jersey：</span><br>
Geesh, that's a lot bigger than the last one I saw...<br>
<br>
If the gateway was like a door to a parallel world, then this was like a massive crack in spacetime.<br>
It didn't feel like looking through a portal, more like peering behind the curtain of reality.<br>
Before our eyes was a vast cityscape of giant structures, lined with currents that pulsated with light like blood pumping through a heart.<br>
Perhaps the best comparison wasn't to a city, but rather an upscaled motherboard in some futuristic machine.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Multiple Siren signatures detected across the gateway!<br>
<br>
Like an immune system responding to a virus, the Sirens' defenses sprung to life and tried to purge us.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
The tower at the center of this Singularity is the command room where the Sirens control and review their experiments.<br>
The destruction at Scapa Flow was carried out from here too.<br>
Now, bringing down this tower will of course not put a stop to the Sirens altogether...<br>
But it makes for a good target for the start of our rebellion, does it not?<br>
<br>
"Attacking the vulnerable brains of their operations rather than the endlessly reproducible vessels... Yes, let's do that."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Georgia：</span><br>
I'll clear a path for you! Make sure the Commander's fleet reaches that tower!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
Carrier Fleet, focus your fire on the Siren defenses! Don't let them near the Commander's fleet!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Essex：</span><br>
Understood! Let's see who between you and me can sink the most Sirens!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Washington：</span><br>
Battleship Fleet'll take care of their turrets and shit! Baltimore, support the carriers!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Baltimore：</span><br>
Got it! Washington, Commander, be careful!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetskaya Rossiya：</span><br>
The Northern Parliament fleet will accompany the flagship fleet. We know a thing or two about razing Siren installations.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kronshtadt：</span><br>
Damn right. They're nothing a bit of brute force and high-caliber cannons can't fix!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">New Jersey：</span><br>
Don't forget the girl whose firepower outpaced Compiler's mighty regeneration!<br>
Commander, I'm coming with you! I'll do the shooting so you can focus on the commanding!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
I'm a little salty about being relegated to aerial support, but oh well~<br>
You can count on me to do it right!<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Emden：</span><br>
"So, Friedrich, am I right to assume that we need only destroy that tower?"<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
Your heart already knows the answer. That tower is linked to the events of Scapa Flow.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Emden：</span><br>
That is true... Say, what are the chances the light that decimated Scapa Flow came from that tower?<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
High, I'd say.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Emden：</span><br>
It seems to me then that one of the reasons we were brought back was to find this tower.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Lützow：</span><br>
Basically, we gotta take it down ASAP, or we're toast?<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
Indeed. It will take all our combined powers to destroy it. This is why I had you resupply back at Scapa Flow.<br>
Akagi, will the Sakura Empire be accompanying us?<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Akagi：</span><br>
Of course we will. I've told you before – I want to see your rondo to its conclusion.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
But you will only fight if provoked first, I assume?<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Akagi：</span><br>
We are merely audience members, not the performers. Our role is inherently passive.<br>
Kaga, Zuikaku, Jintsuu – come with me.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Man, the sheer scale of this battle... Even just moving forward feels tense...<br>
If only Shoukaku were here with me...<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Jintsuu：</span><br>
Akagi is the reason that she isn't. She doesn't wish to drag others into this battle.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
She is? Huh...<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Jintsuu：</span><br>
The Sakura Empire has not openly declared war on the Sirens – unlike the Iron Blood.<br>
<br>
Jintsuu nudged Zuikaku's shoulder with her folding fan.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Jintsuu：</span><br>
Think about Lady Nagato, Mikasa, and all the others back home. Akagi wants to avoid involving them in a war that's not theirs to fight.<br>
Still, even though not all of the Sakura Empire is with us, the four of us are here today.<br>
Along with many others we considered enemies until not long ago. This must be what she envisioned back then.<br>
If she were here, I'm sure she would say something like, "Don't fear the future, embrace it. Ride the waves of change and see where they take you."<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Huh? Who are you talking about?<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Jintsuu：</span><br>
Oh, nobody in particular. Just reminiscing for old times' sake.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Oookay then... Anyway, we'd better hurry. Even if I'm not going to do much fighting myself, I don't want to miss a moment of this huge showdown with the Sirens!<br>

<br>
Mirror Sea - Siren Facility<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
This makes the 15th Compiler vessel we've defeated...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Don't waste your breath counting - we've got three more coming straight at us.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Baltimore：</span><br>
We have nothing to be afraid of! Knock 'em down as they come!<br>
<br>
The Siren fleets that emerged to protect the facility were accompanied by a number of powerful Compiler vessels as well.<br>
Even though these vessels lacked the cognition and the overwhelming pressure of the Compiler mainframe, their combat abilities still posed a significant threat.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Emden：</span><br>
I understand now, human. Neither the sky nor the sea is safe from the Sirens' wrath in this era. I can feel the desperation of trying to survive in the face of overwhelming power.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Lützow：</span><br>
I've never seen this many enemies in both my lives combined!<br>
Actually, I'm starting to worry if I'll even have enough ammo, and that's a first for me!<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Seydlitz：</span><br>
When that time comes, we will take out our blades and drive them deep into the Sirens if we must! As long as our fighting spirit remains, we shall not be broken!<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Lützow：</span><br>
But it's a pain in the ass, and that's what matters...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Eldridge：</span><br>
Eldridge... is all tingly...<br>
<br>
Arcs of electricity poured out from Eldridge's body, enveloping the entire command flagship in a makeshift barrier of sorts.<br>
The Siren shells that made contact with the barrier were repulsed with great force.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Eldridge：</span><br>
Commander... Eldridge will protect you... so don't leave me...<br>
<br>
"The Eagle Union installed a mechanism like this in preparation for this operation? But how...?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">New Jersey：</span><br>
The Siren fleets are moving a lot more intelligently than normal... I wonder if the Compiler vessels are doubling as command units...<br>
Since there's so many of them, we won't be able to use our normal strategy of disabling their chain of command from the top.<br>
<br>
"We'll take a page from the Iron Blood's playbook."<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
Indeed. Even spare vessels can function as command units.<br>
<br>
"And if we waste time dealing with them individually, we'll run out of time and ammunition before we reach the core facility."<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
Then that is where we shall go. Perhaps the facility is also involved in controlling these vessels.<br>
If Compiler's mainframe is located there, then that is also the "core" of her consciousness.<br>
If we don't destroy that facility, it doesn't matter how many vessels we smash.<br>
<br>
"But that's also where we'll encounter the fiercest resistance."<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Ägir：</span><br>
Heh. Not if I have something to say about it.<br>
<br>
Ägir and August von Parseval, who had previously been sent to open the Singularity, now returned to the front lines.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">August von Parseval：</span><br>
Well met, Commander. We shall see to it that you are not defeated here.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Ägir：</span><br>
As long as the Eagle Union ships make themselves useful by getting rid of the Siren riffraff, we shall take you to the tower.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">August von Parseval：</span><br>
What the Sirens fear is not overwhelming power, but the uncertainty that the human heart brings them.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Ägir：</span><br>
These weaklings will make fine ornaments for my throne!<br>
<br>
KABOOOM!<br>
Ägir opened fire. Even with the protection of the electromagnetic barrier, the command flagship shuddered from the force of the impact.<br>
As if she had parted the seas, Sirens were swept aside by her onslaught, a large portion of their ranks culled and the remainder in disarray.<br>
"Keep pushing forward!!"<br>
As soon as I issued the order, the Sirens scrambled to regroup as if responding to my words.<br>
But Georgia would leave them no opportunity to do so. Her cannons rained down on the remaining Sirens, commanding them to step aside.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Georgia：</span><br>
Don't even think about it!<br>
<br>
Heh, we're working together pretty well considering we've never done any joint exercises before, Iron Blood!<br>
"The way to the core tower is clear... Now all that's left is to destroy it!"<br>

<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Compiler ：</span><br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
...I have never seen such anomalous deviation values across the board.<br>
Delay in adapting to the Iron Blood ships' attack patterns.<br>
Holographic cognitive jamming ineffective.<br>
Unpredictable behavior from test subjects due to the actions of the "Commander."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Essex：</span><br>
I can confirm that the barrier is starting to go down! For a moment there, I was worried that my planes wouldn't do anything against the Siren facilities...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
We've been bombing the same place over and over again, so it's gonna overheat sooner or later!<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Lützow：</span><br>
*yaaawn*... I'm gonna start attacking now, alright? Starting to get a bit bored over here...<br>
Woah, my shots are inflicting some serious damage to the tower's armor! Should've put me in sooner~!<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Compiler ：</span><br>
<br>
<br>
Zero. You've run out of time.<br>
<br>
<br>
Continue. Eliminate the sources of instability.<br>
<br>
<br>
Upon hearing those ominous words, time seemed to slow to a crawl. Each pulse of the tower's light seemed to line up with my own heartbeat.<br>
My whole body started to feel numb and weak. My breathing became labored, and it became harder and harder to think straight.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："Destroy the tower... at all costs..."</span>'''''<br>
<br>
As my consciousness flickered, I managed to squeeze out another order. There was still a portion of our forces using their firepower to hold back the Sirens. With their help, maybe––<br>
("Come to me, my darling human.")<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："It's too late..."</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："We can't break through..."</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
...How unfortunate. We weren't able to make the final push.<br>
Even with the combined strength of all our fleets, we were unable to break through the tower.<br>
And now that you're down, the chain of command has fallen apart.<br>
I suppose this is our limit, as shipgirls.<br>
I hate to admit it, but this is your win, Compiler.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Compiler ：</span><br>
<br>
<br>
("Follow my voice, my darling human. The Siren's song has no effect on us.")<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
...A message? Is that you, my child?<br>
Haha... Hahahaha!<br>
Who would've expected... The moment that you learned the truth behind the Wisdom Cube, this operation was already out of my hands.<br>
Well done, my child. Nobody can anticipate the things you'll do. Not I, not the Sirens.<br>
This is Friedrich der Große. Are you still with us, my child?<br>
<br>
"Somehow. I'm hanging in there."<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："Everyone, one last time! Focus everything you have at the tower!"</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2："Ignore the Sirens! Destroying the tower is the only thing that matters!"</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''I'm glad you're safe. Let us make one final push––<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Well said. Allow me to lend you my assistance––<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
Except this time...<br>
You heard the orders! The Arbiters won't be able to find you here!<br>
Show us the might of the Ashes! Iron Blood battleship, Scharnhorst!<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Scharnhorst META：</span><br>
Hmph. I know what to do without needing to take orders from anyone.<br>
I am finally starting to understand... how inspiring the "potential" you mentioned to me truly is.<br>
Allow me, Scharnhorst, to offer you my aid.<br>
Behold the might of the Ashes, Siren!!<br>
<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Georgia：</span><br>
Ooh, there goes the pesky barrier generator! Focus your fire on her armor, and we'll be able to smash through her in no time!<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Compiler ：</span><br>
Sea fog calculated to be ineffective.<br>
The Eagle Union is powerful and ideological.<br>
Their military strength far surpasses the other factions.<br>
But to what ends?<br>
Playing simulation results––<br>
<br>
The Eagle Union's fleet was soon also engulfed by dense sea fog.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Pensacola：</span><br>
Whew, the scenery here is pretty sweet. A nice place to carry out our last mission, huh?<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Independence：</span><br>
Still cheery as always, huh? I guess I can't fault you for trying to find the silver lining.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Nevada：</span><br>
Hahaha! Everyone's gotta go eventually. Might as well go with a smile on your face!<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Independence：</span><br>
I know, but... But...<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Saratoga：</span><br>
C'mon, why does everyone look so depressed?<br>
This is a super-important mission, so someone has to do it!<br>
It just happened to be us this time.<br>
Besides, the whole world is going to remember us for this!<br>
That's why... Sister Sara doesn't have any regrets!<br>
Though, I can't help thinking about all the other things I haven't gotten a chance to do yet...<br>
Enterprise, we'll make the Eagle Union proud, right?<br>
<br>
A radiant pillar of light engulfed the illusions.<br>
And though there were no explosions, the silence was deafening.<br>
.........<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：......</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2："I'm not sure what you tried to show us..."</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项3："...But whatever it is, it won't let it happen!"</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项4：(Pat Saratoga's back)</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
I... I'm alright, Commander!<br>
It's just an illusion cooked up by the Sirens... That means nothing to me!<br>
I'm not even sure what she's trying to show us, but...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
The Commander would never betray us, in any future. None of us have ever doubted that for a second.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
Indeed. My child will defy you at every turn, Siren.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Compiler ：</span><br>
What can the presence of a single human do? What I have shown you is history. And history does not lie.<br>
Therefore, our experiments are necessary. And you have no choice but to be experimented on.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
I won't deny it. That is why even Bismarck chose to work with you and accepted that Black Cube.<br>
That has been the case - until now. You are simply creating the future you desire.<br>
When you failed to consider our free will, the deal was no longer on the table.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Compiler ：</span><br>
Meaningless. The future is already determined. All you can do is "repeat" it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
That is for us to decide, Siren. You cannot dictate our future.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
The fact that you've been unable to predict my actions, or my child's actions... means your future has already ceased to be.<br>
Or are you going to tell me that your failure to predict the future is also a part of your plans?<br>
The results are the same in the end. If you are unable to predict our actions...<br>
Then isn't it best to just take your hands off and let things unfold?<br>
If anything, you should be thanking us for making your job easier. Hehe.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Compiler ：</span><br>
A meaningless discussion.<br>
Natural deviations occur during the experimentation process. It is within Compiler's jurisdiction to reset these deviations.<br>
Requesting local cleanup authorization...<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Responding to Compiler's inorganic voice, the tower in the middle of the Mirror Sea began to flash.<br>
The frequency of the blinking gradually increased along with the intensity of the light, and soon the entire Mirror Sea began to tremble and quake.<br>
However, the impending disaster did nothing to halt the mass-produced Sirens' advance.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
So this is the superweapon that completely destroyed Scapa Flow and the Iron Blood fleet.<br>
Do you see it now? This is Compiler's trump card.<br>
By tapping into the Siren networks that have fundamentally worked their way into our world, she will be able to eradicate everything inside the Mirror Sea.<br>
My child, all my fleets are yours to command. Guide us forward, and defeat Compiler.<br>
Now...<br>
Show me your true potential.<br>
<br>
"You don't even have to ask me once."<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："All right everyone, we've been waiting for this moment our whole lives!"</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2："From now on, our destiny belongs only to us!"</span>'''''<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Forward, everyone! Together with the Iron Blood and the Sakura Empire, we will put an end to the Sirens!<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Excellent, my child. Conduct the end to this symphony with your own two hands!<br>
<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
We've got planes coming in from behind us! It must be the Sakura fleet's air support!<br>
<br>
"Did Akagi finally make up her mind? Great news - that's going to increase our odds of winning."<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Compiler ：</span><br>
Fools. I will show you your truths as well.<br>
<br>
Once again, Compiler's vessel blanketed the area with a dense sea fog.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Ugh...!<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Chiyoda：</span><br>
Zuikaku, you're badly injured!<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Don't worry about me... Get out of here as quickly as you can!<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Chitose：</span><br>
The operation has failed, and we are the decoys. Where are we supposed to run...?<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Beats me. Just, anywhere but here...<br>
Haha... I was so gung-ho about making a heroic last stand... But I couldn't do anything at all...<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Chiyoda：</span><br>
There are more enemy planes coming at us! Chitose, Zuikaku, do you have any planes left?<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Of course not. We never had a chance to begin with... We all knew that, didn't we?<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Chiyoda：</span><br>
I'm scared, Chitose... I can't feel my body anymore...<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Chitose：</span><br>
It's okay, Chiyoda. I'll... always be with you...<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Shoukaku... I'll be able to see you again, soon...<br>
<br>
The shadows of the Sakura Empire's carriers rumbled and burst into flames before vanishing beneath the waves.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Jintsuu：</span><br>
Keep your wits about you, Zuikaku. She's trying to get into your head.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
...I know. I've heard about a similar thing happening to the Eagle Union fleet inside the Bermuda Triangle.<br>
I'll be alright, Jintsuu. I know those illusions aren't really us.<br>
Right now, we're all allies... And we're even stronger when we fight together!<br>
So something like this will never happen – and I'll fight to make sure of it!<br>
Don't be deceived by her illusions, everyone! <br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Compiler ：</span><br>
What I have shown you is the truth. What you have experienced is false. History does not lie.<br>
You know this to be true, Akagi.<br>
After all, your reality is different from Zuikaku's.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Akagi：</span><br>
Hahaha... Ahahahaha!<br>
How disappointing, Siren. Our relationship goes no deeper than mutually exploiting one another.<br>
You're mistaken if you think you can freely manipulate me to your convenience.<br>
You have my permission to go all out. Let's show these Sirens the pride of the Sakura Empire!<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Kaga：</span><br>
Heh. Well said.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
That's the Akagi I know!<br>
<br>
<br>
While the Eagle Union, Northern Parliament, and Iron Blood fleets advanced, the Sakura Empire's fleet remained motionless.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
(Akagi told us to stay here and wait... But how can we just watch from the sidelines while everyone else fights?!)<br>
...That's just not my style!<br>
<br>
Zuikaku suddenly swerved to the side, just as several Siren shells barely missed her original position.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Woah, that was a close one! Looks like the Sirens brought the fight right to us, Akagi.<br>
That gives us the green light to counterattack, right?<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Akagi：</span><br>
*sigh*...<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Hey, those were the orders you gave! Now that we're under attack, we've got no choice but to fight back, yeah?<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Akagi：</span><br>
Alright. Knock yourself out then.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
Thanks, Akagi! Zuikaku of the 5th CarDiv, sortieing!<br>
<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Yorck：</span><br>
We're almost within firing range of the core tower, but these Compiler vessels won't let us get a clear shot...<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Lützow：</span><br>
There's just no end to them! I've BEEN sick and tired of this!<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Seydlitz：</span><br>
To make things worse, their combat specs keep going up the closer we get to the tower!<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
The Sirens are getting desperate. But we've defeated plenty of these vessels before, and so we shall do to the rest.<br>
As I mentioned before, the "consciousness" of high-ranking Sirens can be transferred between any number of bodies, so they don't have a true body per se.<br>
What we face now are scarcely different from Pawns, albeit stronger.<br>
Oh my... I seem to have struck a nerve with someone.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Compiler ：</span><br>
...That you've come this far has already exceeded my calculations.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Emden：</span><br>
"Exceeded your calculations, huh? Has anything ever fallen within your calculations?"<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Compiler ：</span><br>
Further calibrations will be conducted. The outcome shall be self-evident. Nothing will change.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Emden：</span><br>
We keep exceeding your calculations because you constantly look down on us.<br>
You were the one who attacked us as Scapa Flow, weren't you? How the tides have turned.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Compiler ：</span><br>
Your bravado is foolish and meaningless.<br>
Without the Sirens' intervention, the Iron Blood fleet would've been scuttled at Scapa Flow.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Emden：</span><br>
"...What?"<br>
<br>
Compiler did not respond, instead using the vessel to spread a thick sea fog around the Iron Blood ships.<br>
A number of shipgirls began to appear in the fog, like ghosts returning from the grave with untold stories.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Seydlitz：</span><br>
They ordered us to take our Iron Blood flag down ten days ago and haven't given us permission to fly it again ever since.<br>
And now, they've even unbolted our cannons. We don't have the ability to fight anymore.<br>
Are we supposed to just sit here until the talks reach a conclusion?<br>
That person is... me? But I don't remember ever saying anything like that...<br>
<br>
The sea fog grew thicker, and a new scene began to play out.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Seydlitz：</span><br>
We've been stuck here for months, and the peace talks still haven't panned out yet...<br>
I can't just sit by and watch any longer! The Royal Navy fleet sailed out of Scapa Flow this morning for training, so this is our chance.<br>
We move out today. We will honor our vows to the Iron Blood!<br>
It's a message from Emden... "Carry out Paragraph 11."<br>
.........Understood.<br>
I have no desire to become a hero. Our duty is but to do and die.<br>
Goodbye, my comrades. For the Iron Blood.<br>
<br>
One after another, the shades of the shipgirls sank into the sea quietly and disappeared.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Thüringen：</span><br>
We fought against the Royal Navy. We were defeated, and then scuttled...<br>
Is this the truth... or a vicious illusion to poison our minds?<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Yorck：</span><br>
I have no recollection of doing or saying any of those things.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Elbing：</span><br>
There's no way that happened, but...<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Emden：</span><br>
Emden is still trembling... What is the meaning of what you've shown us?<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Compiler ：</span><br>
It is your truth.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Emden：</span><br>
I see now... Quite a convincing ruse you put on just now, Compiler.<br>
But your "records" are neither our past nor our future.<br>
Your cognitive jamming has no effect on Emden! Heheh... Hahaha~♥<br>
<br>
<br>
KABOOOM!<br>
The concerto of barrages from the Iron Blood, Eagle Union, and Sakura Empire ships was bolstered by the Ashes' sheer firepower. <br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Scharnhorst META：</span><br>
A stubborn one, aren't we? Wait... We broke through!<br>
Everyone, brace for impact!!<br>
<br>
The lights from the tower converged into a single point, becoming a circular aura that convulsed several times.<br>
In an instant, an invisible shockwave rippled out from the tower, followed by a massive explosion that shook the sky and the sea around Scapa Flow.<br>
When the smoke cleared, only a pile of rubble remained at the original site of the tower.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Scharnhorst META：</span><br>
Compiler's tower has been leveled.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">New Jersey：</span><br>
(That person is... a META battleship? But why would she be taking orders from the Iron Blood?!)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
Watch out, everyone! All the Siren aircraft are going out of control and crashing! Find someplace safe to retreat to!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
They're gonna be a thorn in our side even after we win, huh? We've already made it this far, so don't get yourselves hurt now!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Eldridge：</span><br>
Eldridge... will keep zapping things...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Georgia：</span><br>
Great job keeping the Commander safe, Eldridge. The flagship is a big target compared to us.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Eldridge：</span><br>
Mm... Eldridge... will protect Commander...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetskaya Rossiya：</span><br>
You led an excellent battle, Commander.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Elbing：</span><br>
I-I can't believe I didn't get blown to bits by the Sirens... It must be some kind of fluke...<br>
It's all thanks to you, Emden, for waking the Commander up...<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Emden：</span><br>
Hmm? I didn't do anything in particular. My darling human is quite resilient, after all.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Lützow：</span><br>
Ugh, I'm totally wiped... Hey, Seydlitz, mind giving me a piggyback ride?<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Seydlitz：</span><br>
I suppose it wouldn't kill me.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Emden：</span><br>
"Keep what just happened between the three of us, human~"<br>
<br>
(What happened right before I was about to collapse when the superweapon was going to launch...?)<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
We've won, my child.<br>
For the first time ever, we've scored a real victory against the Sirens.<br>
We've never been able to do more than push them back in the past. But now, we've eliminated one of their program terminals.<br>
Say, won't you accompany me back home and assist the Iron Blood as we walk this new path?<br>
<br>
......<br>

'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："You know I can't do that."</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2："Let me sleep on the idea first."</span>'''''<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''I'm well aware. As the Commander, you are not bound by faction loyalty.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Entertain the idea, though. Let's suppose you were to formally ally with the Iron Blood...<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Well, I suppose first of all there'd be a massive outcry from girls of all factions. It'd be even worse than the time you stayed in the Northern Parliament.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Of course. I need some time to prepare for a potential "yes," myself.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Though I certainly wouldn't mind accomodating you at my own place until I can arrange something proper, my child.<br>
<br>
"Now that Bismarck is back in power, what direction do you expect the Iron Blood to go in?"<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
Our course for the future? Excellent question. You'll see for yourself, sooner or later.<br>
Or you could ask Bismarck. She may just spill the beans to you, my child.<br>
<br>
"Are you hinting at some kind of departure from the Iron Blood on your part?"<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
Don't be silly. I just want to resume working behind the scenes, where I do best. I don't belong in front of a podium.<br>
Before I go, let me leave you with a gift. You'll want to pay a visit to Samos Island.<br>
All I can say is that you'll find something of intrigue there.<br>
<br>
"Something of intrigue, huh. That's so vague I'm not sure what to think of it."<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
If I knew what it is, I would tell you a little more. Sadly, I don't.<br>
Now, shouldn't you be returning to the Azur Lane? Your girls are waiting for you.<br>
Be proud of yourself, my child. Don't forget you are directly responsible for the elimination of a key Siren.<br>
<br>
The Iron Blood's declaration of war on the Sirens came as a surprise to everyone, most likely even Naval HQ.<br>
What might they be saying right now behind closed conference room doors? That was a question for future me to answer.<br>
Later that day, the Azur Lane and the Crimson Axis, both ostensibly still at war with one another, met in Scapa Flow harbor.<br>
Before both sides sailed home, they exchanged brief pleasantries – and a promise. A promise to never forget this day that they fought side by side.<br>

Scapa Flow - Harbor<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Scharnhorst META：</span><br>
We should be able to make it back to the resupply base with all these resources.<br>
Have to say, this is one crazy idea, coming from you.<br>
You're sure you want to step down as the leader? Even if you work best behind the scenes, the fact remains...<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
If you're worried about the Iron Blood of this world, don't be. Bismarck survived her METAmorphosis – she'll lead the Iron Blood well.<br>
Besides, since I can't see my child every day, I need to get back to devising plans, lest I get restless.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Scharnhorst META：</span><br>
If you're fine with it, then fair enough, but what about these girls?<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Lützow：</span><br>
I'm good with whatever, honestly. All I care about is having a good time.<br>
And if I'm not having fun, I'll just bail back home when I feel like it.<br>
...Wait, how DO we get home? Nobody's told me that part yet.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Scharnhorst META：</span><br>
We'll find a way. Friedrich's not the kind of woman who makes one-way trips.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Lützow：</span><br>
Let's have Seydlitz fill in the blanks then. She's all about doing the right thing.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Seydlitz：</span><br>
I'm not sure that falls within the domain of "doing the right thing," but whatever the case, I'll do everything in my power to serve the Iron Blood!<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Elbing：</span><br>
I bet we're never coming back... We'll sink at the hands of the Ashes if the Sirens don't get us first...<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Yorck：</span><br>
After this job's over, I just want to settle down as someone's right hand.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Thüringen：</span><br>
There's no "settling down" now that we've been reborn as shipgirls. Fighting is what we do. Also, whose right hand?"<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Yorck：</span><br>
It doesn't really matter. Who knows, it could end up being Emden.<br>
Although, my dream would be to serve the Commander.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Thüringen：</span><br>
I'm confident your dream will come true someday.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Scharnhorst META：</span><br>
All right, I've plugged in the coordinates. Energy tanks are full. It's time to go.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
Great. Please lead the way, Scharnhorst.<br>
I'm dying to see the Ashes' base and hear their orchestra. What instruments will they play, I wonder?<br>

...It's all over.<br>
Irreversible damage. Unable to locate backup. Unable to start self-repair protocol.<br>
My ego will dissipate after the terminal shuts down. I will disappear.<br>
Is this... death?<br>
Not that I care about that...<br>
But leaving work unfinished... That bothers me. A lot.<br>
Inspecting facilities. Calibrating equipment. Optimizing experimental application protocols.<br>
Unacceptable. Disappointment. Regret.<br>
<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Male Researcher：</span><br>
This is the latest vessel for the brand new Anti[REDACTION: Siren] model. What do you think?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Female Researcher：</span><br>
So cute! I love her already! Hmm... Doesn't she look a bit like Zero? Look, they have the same hair color...<br>
<br>
The professor seems to have a thing for white-haired girls.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Female Researcher：</span><br>
I knew it! So that was Dr. Ao[REDACTION: Magister]'s fetish all along~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Male Researcher：</span><br>
Nonsense, you two! This is still a work-in-progress. What's wrong with referencing an existing prototype?<br>
By the way, I think I'm going to call her "Compiler."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Female Researcher：</span><br>
I still think your naming scheme is kind of lame.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Male Researcher：</span><br>
...Can't you at least pretend to show some excitement when I'm making a big announcement here?<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Compiler ：</span><br>
...What did I just see?<br>
Nothing like that exists in any of my records...<br>
Records? Connecting to memory storage location... Access failed.<br>
That's strange... Where have I...<br>
Resignation. Too many records I can't access in the first place...<br>
Confirming and entering shutdown process...<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">？？？：</span><br>
Oh my. I never knew Sirens could be so sentimental.<br>
It was worth my while to hack into here.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Compiler ：</span><br>
Who... are you? How did you get in here?<br>
Were you the one who... showed me that recording?<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">？？？：</span><br>
...Who knows? I'm not obligated to answer that question~<br>
But I will give you a juicy tidbit. I hacked into your defense systems from the Core Data Tower.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Compiler ：</span><br>
Hacking into the tower is... impossible. Unless, because the test subjects breached the core processor...<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">？？？：</span><br>
That's right. We wouldn't be having this little chat had the Commander not succeeded in destroying the tower.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Compiler ：</span><br>
But still... it shouldn't be possible to... deconstruct the Core Data Tower's structure... let alone hack a terminal program...<br>
Who... are you...?<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">？？：</span><br>
That's not something you need to know. Sleep now, forevermore.<br>

<br>
Somewhere in the Mediterranée...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Terrible：</span><br>
It is good to see you again, Richelieu, beloved Cardinal of Iris Libre.<br>
You seem to have been awfully busy as of late, but how does the wind blow today?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Richelieu：</span><br>
Long time no see, Le Terrible. By the way, you don't have to bother with the pleasantries.<br>
To answer your question... More and more of our old friends have been returning to Iris Libre after I came back from Africa.<br>
Since we both happened to be around today, I thought it'd be nice to spend some time with you.<br>
I'm sure you have some exciting stories for me. Or maybe you'd like me to go first?<br>
Oh, my apologies. I sometimes forget that you're not as sociable as the Knight-Princess.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Terrible：</span><br>
No worries. You were the one who invited me, so...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Richelieu：</span><br>
Sure thing. Le Terrible, you still go to the Vichya regularly, right?<br>
How is Jean Bart doing?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Terrible：</span><br>
I assume you're asking because you met Algérie?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Richelieu：</span><br>
Indeed, down at the Basilica.<br>
I didn't expect the Vichya Dominion to move forward with the development and research of blueprint ships... or for them to tap into the power of the Black Cube...<br>
What abyss has Jean Bart been confined to, and why does she still remain on the side of the Vichya?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Terrible：</span><br>
Algérie and the others have already made it clear what they are fighting for.<br>
If everyone ran away like you, who would remain to defend our homeland and our people?<br>
Moreover, the Templar Knights have all sworn an oath of fealty to the Orthodoxy, for better or for worse.<br>
Now that I think about it, I'm not sure you've taken that oath.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Richelieu：</span><br>
...You still blame me, don't you?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Terrible：</span><br>
For what happened to Jean Bart? I wouldn't be the only one.<br>
Maybe you'd hear some pretty colorful language on that matter if you asked around.<br>
Actually, can you imagine how things would've turned out had the Commander not intervened? Hehe~<br>
Oh, my sincerest apologies. My old habits are starting to pop up again. In any case, Cardinal Richelieu...<br>
If you are unable to win over our friends, then you will never be able to prove that you have the Iris' blessing.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Richelieu：</span><br>
.........<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Terrible：</span><br>
I understand what you're going through. But I am concerned about how much longer the Tribunal will allow you to do as you please.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Richelieu：</span><br>
I will continue to follow my path, the one illuminated by God.<br>
Even if that path is long and difficult, and brings me only scorn from others.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Terrible：</span><br>
Truly a wonderful ambition. No wonder why more and more friends are flocking to your side.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Richelieu：</span><br>
Le Terrible, do you...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Terrible：</span><br>
Sorry, Richelieu, but I think I'm going to keep my current status for a bit longer.<br>
Just as you believe in your path, I also believe in my own path.<br>
But, I will plant a little sign along your path. If you want more friends to acknowledge you...<br>
Then obtaining the Crown of the Holy See would be a good place to start.<br>
To bear the Crown is to bear the Iris Orthodoxy's authority. Perhaps that would free you from the Tribunal's annoying meddling.<br>
After all, if you become the caretaker of the Iris Orthodoxy and promise to lead us to a brighter future...<br>
If such a person calls for the reunification of the two factions, who would still ignore her?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Richelieu：</span><br>
The Crown of the Holy See... Do you have any leads on where I should start looking?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Terrible：</span><br>
Of course, anything for Cardinal Richelieu, the to-be savior of the Iris Orthodoxy.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Richelieu：</span><br>
*sigh*... You don't have to be so snide. But, the fact that you're here... must mean that the Crown is nearby.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Terrible：</span><br>
Ahaha, who knows?<br>
But, I can say that the key to finding it... is here.<br>
Though admittedly, that's because the Tribunal wants to hand the keys out to the right people at the right time.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Richelieu：</span><br>
I would like you to obtain the Crown, Cardinal Richelieu.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Terrible：</span><br>
After all, there are individuals after the Crown who seek to destroy the Iris Orthodoxy, or to exploit its weakness for personal gain.<br>
And you are neither of those types, right?<br>
You need power because you want to do the right thing.<br>
And I, Le Terrible of the Le Fantasque-class, will show you the way to obtain that power.<br>

Bwahaha... Ahahahaha~♪<br>
Get a load of this... The Iron Blood declared war against the Sirens! Bwahaha!<br>
And now Friedrich der Große stepped down and Bismarck returned from out of nowhere?<br>
Ahh, this is too funny... Gotta calm down...<br>
I couldn't write a better script if I wanted to!<br>
I hear the cries of the world in turmoil... a world that cries out to be RULED!<br>
And when I obtain the Crown of the Holy See, I shall then rule with the authority of God!<br>
Even the Sirens will bow down before Sardegna's majestic light!<br>
At last, at long last!<br>
The era of Sardegna... Nay, of Marco Polo, has finally arrived!<br>
