<br>
Ooshio the Secretary<br>
It was an ordinary morning. The cool sea breeze was blowing, the sun was gently rising, and the port was wrapped in silence.<br>
In the distance one could see the silhouette of a young girl walking with a cheerful gait, heading towards the Commander's office.<br>
Port - Office<br>
I opened the door to my office and—<br>
What the...?<br>
This place was a mess when I went home yesterday, but someone had thoroughly cleaned it up. It almost looked like a newly built apartment ready for an occupant.<br>
Even the air smelled fresher than it usually did because all the furniture had been polished to a mirror sheen.<br>
And in the center of the room was a young girl, silently standing around.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ooshio：</span><br>
Mornin', Commander~ My name's Ooshio, I'm here to serve as yer secretary~<br>
As she greeted me, she left her broom on a shelf nearby.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Greet her back</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：Compliment her</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ooshio：</span><br>
*Giggle*, I know ya never asked me to clean the office, but I'm glad ya like its new look~<br>
Now just sit down 'n relax, Commander~<br>
<br>
I sat down in my chair as Ooshio served me coffee and some biscuits.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ooshio：</span><br>
Ya oughta keep yer sugar intake low in order to stay healthy~<br>
Whatcha want for breakfast? Bacon 'n eggs? Ya sure ya oughta have both?<br>
<br>
It seemed like Ooshio was going to spoil me rotten before I could even start working.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ooshio：</span><br>
I reckon we'll be spendin' a lotta time together from now on♪ Hope I can be of use to ya~<br>

<br>
Do Ya Like Girls?<br>
Port - Coast<br>
Ooshio and I observed the fleet as they were training.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ooshio：</span><br>
Hot as heck today, don'tcha think... We oughta get in the shade of that tree, else we might be riskin' a heatstroke.<br>
...Honestly, nobody should even be out trainin' in this sizzlin' heat...<br>
<br>
We decided to stand in the shade of the tree together. The pleasant sea breeze blew against our bodies and cooled them down.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ooshio：</span><br>
Hehe, hehehe♪<br>
Commander, don'tcha think hardworkin' girls are mighty cute? Hehehe♪<br>
Just watchin' 'em exertin' themselves and workin' up a sweat makes my heart go thump thump~<br>
Ah, I don't mean I get a kick outta watchin' people hurt! I'm just sayin' I love cute girls, that's all~<br>
<br>
The day of training was over.<br>
As I was making sure everyone was heading back to the dormitory, Ooshio proposed we "take a short walk together."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ooshio：</span><br>
Gosh, what a pretty sunset~ Ya think the seagulls like watchin' the sun settin' over the ocean too?<br>
Ah, also, since everyone's worked their butts off today, I was hopin' I could convince ya to treat 'em with some snow cones... Whaddya say, Commander?<br>
Hehe♪ Then I'mma go on ahead 'n get the word out~<br>
<br>
As soon as Ooshio heard my reply, she ran off to talk to all the girls who had finished training.<br>
Just another quiet day at the base.<br>

<br>
Fate or Miracle?<br>
Port - Office<br>
I finished my work for the morning and was taking some sweet time to relax.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ooshio：</span><br>
I done made some handmade sweets for ya, Commander~ Hope you'll like 'em~<br>
They've got less sugar in 'em since I'm conscious 'bout yer health~<br>
<br>
Ooshio left a small box right in front of me. Opening it revealed appetizing biscuits and cookies in various shapes, all lined up nicely inside.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ooshio：</span><br>
Oh, almost forgot to say: ya only get half of 'em. Be nice 'n leave the rest, will ya?<br>
<br>
Only half of it?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ooshio：</span><br>
Who's gettin' the rest? Hehehe, come along 'n you'll find out who~<br>
<br>
Being curious, I decided to follow Ooshio.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ooshio：</span><br>
We're here, Commander~<br>
Howdy, Shigure, it's me~<br>
<br>
The place Ooshio had taken me to was a room in the Sakura Empire's dormitory.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shigure：</span><br>
Oh, it's you! Hehe, I was gonna show you my new nails today, and... Huh, looks like the Commander's here too.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ooshio：</span><br>
Yup♪ Told me, "I'm curious who's getting these snacks," so we went here together~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shigure：</span><br>
Huh, I see. Yuudachi's still sleeping, though.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ooshio：</span><br>
Still sleepin', huh? Then I reckon I oughta show ya my secret trick for wakin' someone up~<br>
<br>
Yuudachi was sleeping soundly on her futon. Ooshio opened the box and took out a biscuit which she put on Yuudachi's nose.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yuudachi：</span><br>
*Sniff, sniff*... Woof! I smell snacks! Where?! Where are the snacks?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ooshio：</span><br>
Μornin', Yuudachi~ I done gotten you some snacks~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yuudachi：</span><br>
W-wait, you mean...?!<br>
Your handmade snacks! Awoooo! I'm as awake as a Pillar Man! Gimme those snacks, right now!<br>
<br>
Yuudachi was as excited as a dog seeing its owner come home when she started munching on Ooshio's snacks.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ooshio：</span><br>
Ya don't gotta eat it all at once~ There's still plenty left~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shigure：</span><br>
Those two share some kind of strange fate... But I'm sure that's nothing you need to worry about, Commander.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ooshio：</span><br>
Hey now, Shigure, don't say that kinda misleadin' stuff to the Commander~<br>

The Trusted Press Corps<br>
Port - Pier<br>
Ooshio and I were patrolling around the base.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Aoba：</span><br>
*Sigh*... If I don't get some new material, my job as a reporter will be over...<br>
I wonder if something headline-worthy has happened anywhere recently...<br>
<br>
Aoba was in dire straits.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Aoba：</span><br>
...Maybe I should MAKE something happen?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ooshio：</span><br>
Hey, is that Aoba sittin' over there? Must have somethin' on her mind... Wait here just a sec, Commander~<br>
<br>
Ooshio went over to greet Aoba.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ooshio：</span><br>
Ya havin' trouble findin' new stuff to write 'bout again?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Aoba：</span><br>
Oh, hey, Ooshio. You know anything I could use? Like something big that even I haven't heard about?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ooshio：</span><br>
Hehehe♪ I reckon I do~<br>
<br>
Ooshio whispered something into Aoba's ear.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Aoba：</span><br>
Holy crap! Y-you're giving me a scoop this big?! You might have it in you to be a reporter!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ooshio：</span><br>
Shhhh! Don't go shoutin'!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Aoba：</span><br>
Oh crap! The Commander's staring at us! Okay, please come back and give me some details later when the Commander's not around!<br>
After Aoba saw me, she panicked and tried her hardest to act normal.<br>
<br>
What in the world was that about?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ooshio：</span><br>
Ya curious what we were talkin' 'bout? Hehehe♪ It's a secret between girls that I can't letcha in on~<br>

<br>
Time for Overtime!<br>
Port - Office<br>
Though it was now late into the night, I still had a big pile of work to do.<br>
There's just no end in sight...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ooshio：</span><br>
Commander, the deadline for these docs is tomorrow mornin', so ya can't rest till ya gone through 'em...<br>
I'll stay here 'n help ya out, so just keep on truckin'...<br>
<br>
Ooshio brought me a glass of milk.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ooshio：</span><br>
How 'bout some milk? It's gettin' late, so I reckon ya could use somethin' warm to drink.<br>
<br>
As I was sipping my hot milk, I looked at the mountainous pile of paperwork left. I let out a sigh and continued working.<br>
Guess I won't be getting any sleep tonight...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">？？？：</span><br>
...Commander? Are ya awake?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ooshio：</span><br>
Ooshio woke me up. I guess I ended up falling asleep in my office.<br>
G'mornin', Commander. Guess ya ended up fallin' asleep in yer office...<br>
I done prepared ya some food. Once yer ready, gimme a call 'n I'll heat it up for ya.<br>
<br>
That's when I noticed that my coat was hanging on my shoulders, like a blanket. Ooshio must've covered me with it while I was sleeping.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ooshio：</span><br>
Sorry for havin' to tell ya this when ya just woke up, but...<br>
<br>
Ooshio placed her hand on a stack of papers. The mountain of paperwork from yesterday was now only a fraction as big.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ooshio：</span><br>
Thanks to yer hard work, ya almost done achieved yer goal~ Reckon ya can manage the final stretch?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Promise Ooshio it'll be a cinch</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：Say "we can do it!"</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ooshio：</span><br>
Haha♪ I knew I could count on ya~<br>
<br>
It felt like I got done with the remaining work in the blink of an eye.<br>

<br>
Catgirl Tea Party<br>
Port - Near the Sakura Empire Dormitory<br>
Ooshio invited me to a tea party with the girls from Destroyer Division 8 on my day off.<br>
Asashio, Ooshio, Michishio, and Arashio were under a big cherry tree, sitting on a picnic blanket and having an enjoyable time.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ooshio：</span><br>
Look, the Commander showed up~<br>
Hey, over here~<br>
<br>
Ooshio guided me to a place to sit on the blanket.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Arashio：</span><br>
Welcome, Commander, to Destroyer Division 8's tea party.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ooshio：</span><br>
Have all the snacks ya want♪ If yer outta tea then let me know~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Michishio：</span><br>
Hmm hm~♪ We get to enjoy this nice weather thanks to you, Commander~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Asashio：</span><br>
Yeah... I hope you'll enjoy our tea party.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ooshio：</span><br>
*Giggle*~ Now let's enjoy some tea~<br>
<br>
I took a sip from my small cup of tea then examined the destroyer sitting next to me.<br>
Asashio was sitting on the side of the blanket and munching on a bear-shaped cookie.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Asashio：</span><br>
*Nom nom nom*...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ooshio：</span><br>
Aahhh~ Yer so cute when yer eatin', Asashio~ I just gotta stroke them ears~<br>
<br>
Ooshio started delicately stroking Asashio's ears.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Asashio：</span><br>
Stop... that tickles...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Michishio：</span><br>
Oh noo~♪ A leaf fell into my teacup...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Arashio：</span><br>
Ooshio, please... Oh, is there not enough room on your side of the blanket, Commander? Please, use this extra one we brought with us.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ooshio：</span><br>
So, Commander, how ya like our tea party~?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Arashio：</span><br>
Allow me to pour you some tea, Commander. Ah, and for you too, Asashio~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Michishio：</span><br>
Sitting under this cherry tree makes me want to sing~ Laa laa laaa~♪<br>
<br>
It felt like I was sitting in a bubble where time itself was moving slowly. A soothing bubble...<br>
[Ooshio and her sisters soothed the Commander!]<br>

<br>
Gentle and Sweet Ooshio!<br>
<br>
See Ya Next Time~<br>
The tea party seemed like it was about to end.<br>
But then an anxious thought suddenly crossed my mind: have I actually just been a nuisance all along?<br>
Maybe I shouldn't have come to the tea party in the first place...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ooshio：</span><br>
Commander, somethin' on yer mind...?<br>
<br>
As if she could read my mind, Ooshio started smiling.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ooshio：</span><br>
I reckon yer worryin' 'bout whether yer just botherin' us, right~?<br>
Yer overthinkin' it, Commander~ Yer our friend... Heck, yer like family to us♪<br>
Am I right or am I right, ya'll~?<br>
<br>
The rest of the Division 8 destroyers joined in.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Asashio：</span><br>
She's right. You don't need to worry about feeling like a nuisance to us, Commander.<br>
You'll still join us for our next tea party, won't you?<br>
<br>
It felt like I was being gently pulled back...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Arashio：</span><br>
I will prepare more snacks for you and Ooshio next time, so please...<br>
Be our honorable guest once more.<br>
<br>
Arashio turned to me and lightly nodded.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Michishio：</span><br>
If you liked the flowers and my singing, feel free to have a chat with me whenever you'd like~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ooshio：</span><br>
*Giggle*~ See, what'd I tell ya~<br>
<br>
Seeing their dazzling smiles made all my doubts vanish completely.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">All 4：</span><br>
We hope to see you next time, Commander~<br>
