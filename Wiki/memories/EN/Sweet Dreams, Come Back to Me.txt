Sweet Dreams, Come Back to Me<br>
<br>
1 Lützow the Undersleeper<br>
Port - Office<br>
Reviewing today's schedule inside my head, I open the door to my office.<br>
What I see on the other side leaves me dumbstruck and frozen in place.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
……<br>
<br>
Lützow always sleeps in and only shows up at the last minute – yet, today, she's sitting upright in the chair, looking out the window with distant eyes.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Lützow? How come you're here so early?<br>
<br>
Only when I call out to her does she notice my presence. She turns around and gives me a weak smile.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lützow：</span><br>
Oh. G'morning, Commander... *sigh*...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(A sigh. Something must be on her mind.)<br>
You okay?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lützow：</span><br>
*yaaawn*... Eh, truth be told, I didn't get much sleep last night.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
You, of all people, undersleeping?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lützow：</span><br>
Hard to believe, I know. Even I'm surprised.<br>
I typically doze off as soon as I shut my eyes. Insomnia? Never heard of her.<br>
Not even a bad time or place can stop me from sleeping. And yet, something did this time.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Maybe you're ill? Have you been to the infirmary?<br>
<br>
Seeing how worn-out she looks, I can't help but worry. I place my hand on her forehead to check her temperature.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Doesn't feel like you have a fever. Still, you should go in for a check with Perseus, just to be sure.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lützow：</span><br>
It's fine. I already went. They said I'm not sick, and even they had no good guesses as to what kept me up.<br>
Anyhow, since I'm here, how about putting me to work?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
In your current state?<br>
<br>
Although she's showing initiative for once, I can't make her do work when she's clearly beat.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lützow：</span><br>
Heheh. That's an interesting look you're making.<br>
Let me guess – you like it when I work hard, don'tcha?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
You'll have to do some work before you can claim to be a hard worker.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lützow：</span><br>
Wow, talk about strict. Fine, let me at it already.<br>
Although, my head's still spinning and I'm struggling to remember what a secretary's supposed to do.<br>
Which is to say – precise orders, please.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Are you sure you're up to the task?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lützow：</span><br>
Hmm... Only one way to find out, methinks.<br>
<br>
She picks up some random paperwork and slowly starts flipping through the pages.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lützow：</span><br>
Better this than just sitting on my butt like usual, right?<br>
Besides, hanging around you is more calming than rolling around in bed like some kind of sausage.<br>
Why are you curbing my enthusiasm now anyway when I for once have the urge to work?<br>
You know what you should do? You should stop worrying and tell me what to do.<br>
If you don't, I'm feeding all these papers to the shredder.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
And what work will there be left to do if you turn it all into ribbons, pray tell?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lützow：</span><br>
It was just a joke. So, what're you gonna have me do?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：(Ask her to sort your paperwork.)</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：(Tell her to make you coffee.)</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''I'd appreciate it if you could quickly sort my documents according to priority and deadline.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Make me a cup of coffee, thanks. Double espresso.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lützow：</span><br>
You got it. Them's the orders, and the orders I will gladly fulfill.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Just don't overwork yourself. Tell me right away if you feel ill.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lützow：</span><br>
Yeah, yeah, I know. Silly worrywart.<br>
<br>
Despite her grumbling, she looks at me with her same old smile.<br>
It's a load off my back to see she's recovering her energy.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(That said, I can't relax just yet. I'll keep an eye on her to see how she fares.)<br>

Sweet Dreams, Come Back to Me<br>
<br>
2 Lützow the Lightheaded<br>
Sometime later...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lützow：</span><br>
Done with these documents. I'll just leave 'em here.<br>
Man... The office sure looks blurry all of a sudden...<br>
Also kinda... wobbly...<br>
<br>
All of a sudden, Lützow starts to stagger. She looks like she's going to collapse, documents still in her hands.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：(The documents come first!)</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：(Catch her!)</span>'''''<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''She worked hard to sort those papers. She'll have to do it all over again if they scatter everywhere...<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''No, what am I thinking? Catching her is obviously way more important!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Careful!<br>
<br>
I extend an arm to support her at once, only for her to still fall – into my arms.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lützow：</span><br>
*yawn*... Thanks, Commander. Quick reflexes you got...<br>
You've been watching me this whole time, haven't you?<br>
<br>
In spite of her weariness, she gives me her typical listless yet mischievous smile.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I can't let you work like this. First of all, we have to solve your sleeping problem.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lützow：</span><br>
C'mooon, I'm fine...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Don't try to pretend like you're not exhausted.<br>
<br>
Taking my words to heart, she pauses for a moment to think.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lützow：</span><br>
Heh. It's really hard to argue with that super-serious look in your eyes.<br>
Alright, alright. I'll do what you say.<br>
What's your plan, then? For fixing this sleeping problem of mine.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Might I suggest a cup of hot chocolate?</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：Lying on the couch would be a good start.</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lützow：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Well, I'm not about to say no to some hot choccy...<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''But you don't REALLY think hot chocolate is the magic cure to insomnia, do you?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Not at all. It's just for calming your nerves.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Here. Come lie on the couch.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lützow：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Don't mind if I do.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''But surely you don't think I just need to lie down and I'll be on the express to dreamland, right?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''I know, just do it. I'll put on some hot chocolate for you. We'll think of a solution together.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lützow：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Wow... You're being extra nice today.<br>
<br>
She casually twirls the end of her hair, then gently taps on my chest with her fingers.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lützow：</span><br>
*yaaawn*... You're treating me like a princess here. It's actually kinda making me feel embarrassed...<br>
Well, embarrassed, but I'm also so dizzy I can't move...<br>
Seems we have no choice – you'll just have to CARRY me like a princess over to the couch!<br>

Sweet Dreams, Come Back to Me<br>
<br>
3 The Cure for Insomnia<br>
After carrying Lützow to the couch and putting on some hot chocolate, it's time to dive into the question of her sleeping problem.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lützow：</span><br>
What's causing it? Yeah, I'd like to know, myself.<br>
<br>
She lies on her side on the couch, looking like a cat basking in the sun.<br>
Between sips from her cup of hot chocolate, she lazily carries on the conversation.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lützow：</span><br>
Hey, how about you tell me a story? Who knows – it might help me fall asleep.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Are my stories really so boring they literally put you to sleep?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lützow：</span><br>
No, no, I didn't mean it like that!<br>
I'm saying your voice is soothing, so hearing it makes me sleepy.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
If that's true, wouldn't you have been sleepy while we were working earlier?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lützow：</span><br>
Oh, right. Guess that's not gonna work.<br>
Ugh. All I want is to sleep like a baby like I normally do...<br>
<br>
While her tone of voice is the same as it's always been, her eyes are dull with the color of exhaustion.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Normally? Wait, that's it! This isn't normal. That's why you can't sleep.<br>
Your sleep schedule has been turned on its head because you sleep during the day, which makes you wide-awake at night.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lützow：</span><br>
*yaaawn*... There's a kernel of truth to that, but it doesn't explain why I'm struggling to sleep now when I never have been before this.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Something, something, it's finally caught up to you. At any rate, try not to sleep during the day after this.<br>
The more you do it, the harder it will be for your body to readjust.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lützow：</span><br>
Fiiine. I guess I SHOULDN'T try to sleep now, then.<br>
Wait... So do I have to keep my eyes open and stare at you until night comes?<br>
Guess that's actually not so bad. Can't sleep, and I'm in no state to work either, so I'll busy myself with watching you do your thing.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I said "after this." In other words, not starting today.<br>
On another note, how about we go out and get some sunlight?<br>
Sunlight inhibits the production of melatonin – the thing that makes you sleepy. It'll also help realign your circadian rhythm.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lützow：</span><br>
Appreciate the biology lesson and all, but does that apply to a shipgirl?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
If nothing else, we can just go for a walk. A bit of mild exercise might help make you sleepy.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lützow：</span><br>
I mean, true, but I'm drained...<br>
I don't imagine it's very nice to walk with someone who has zero energy.<br>
There's also the chance I'll almost pass out like I did earlier...<br>
I'll faceplant the pavement! And you'll leave me behind!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Relax. I won't let you pass out, and I'm definitely not going to leave you behind.<br>
Also, it being "nice" or not isn't important here. This is your well-being we're talking about.<br>
If you really do pass out, I'll carry you back to the infirmary. And yes, like a princess.<br>
<br>
Hearing those words dispels her doubt and lights her cheeks a faint tinge of red.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
There is one risk, I'll admit – that people will misconstrue it as the port's foremost slacker finally doing the unimaginable and falling asleep in the middle of the street.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lützow：</span><br>
Hmph. I don't like the label "slacker." I'm simply someone who saves her energy for when it hits the fan so I can tackle it head on.<br>
I wouldn't call it "sleeping," I'd call it "strategic rest."<br>
I'm a real heavyweight when I get serious, I'll have you know!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
If you say so, slugger. So, do you wanna go outside or not?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lützow：</span><br>
Hmm. Lemme think about it for a minute.<br>

Sweet Dreams, Come Back to Me<br>
<br>
4 Along the Green Road<br>
Port - Park<br>
Sunlight rains down on us through the leaves overhead, casting hazy shadows on the ground.<br>
As I walk with Lützow without any particular place in mind, the early afternoon breeze whispers a tune that makes me feel vaguely tired.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lützow：</span><br>
Whew... This sunlight is divine. I picked a good spot – to nobody's surprise!<br>
I usually only come here to skip work and stuff. Taking a walk through here is pretty nice.<br>
<br>
With a comfortable sigh, she stretches her arms skyward.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Well? Feeling tired yet?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lützow：</span><br>
Meh. Although I'm not feeling dizzy anymore thanks to this fresh air.<br>
<br>
Our walk continues. A short while later, I feel a tug on my sleeve.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lützow：</span><br>
Hey, uh, Commander...<br>
I'm not a burden to you, am I?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
You mean with regard to today's work?<br>
No, it's no big deal. I can make up for lost time with some elbow grease when I get back later.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lützow：</span><br>
I don't mean just today... You know how much I slack off. Working is basically the exception, not the rule for me.<br>
So, you know... I'm just worried that I'm more trouble than I'm worth because I'm so lazy.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Ah. So that's what's on your mind.<br>
Yes, you do skip out on work quite a lot – but when you get the drive, you get things done.<br>
That laid-back, do-it-my-way attitude is what I like about you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lützow：</span><br>
You mean it? You actually view my laziness in a positive light?<br>
Not to say I'm not happy to hear it, but you sure have a unique taste in girls.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Should I take that as a compliment?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lützow：</span><br>
The best compliment I can muster with my lack of energy, I guess.<br>
<br>
She lets out a yawn and brushes off the tears of tiredness welling in the corners of her eyes.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Tired now? We can head back if so.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lützow：</span><br>
Nah. Let's walk and talk a li'l longer.<br>
I've got an idea – you should tell me something.<br>
The mood here is just so relaxing, so hearing your voice might just be the push that gets me to doze off.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Hmm. Alright, I've got one.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：I was trying to haggle at a store, and then...</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：I did overtime, which resulted in me getting more work, and then...</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lützow：</span><br>
Wow... That sounds like a super boring story. Bet it'll give me nightmares!<br>
You know what? I'll tell YOU something instead.<br>
About the coolest dream I've had in recent memory.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Sure. Let's hear it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lützow：</span><br>
Heheh. So, in the dream, you were a big seal. You were swimming through the sea, all carefree.<br>
And guess what? I was a shark.<br>
I chased after you, and I was right behind you the whooole time.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Basically, you were gunning for dinner, am I right?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lützow：</span><br>
Hey, lemme finish. Heheh.<br>
Wouldn't you know it – you and I were just marveling at the sea all around us as we went.<br>
Oh, also, you were sooo cute as a seal!<br>
<br>
The rays of the setting sun embrace us gently as always.<br>
It feels like time has stopped as I look at her, relaxing without a care in the world.<br>

Sweet Dreams, Come Back to Me<br>
<br>
5 Back at Home<br>
Port - Lützow's Quarters<br>
The sun has set, night has come, and I'm back at Lützow's home to see her off.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lützow：</span><br>
Ahh... This was an exceptionally relaxing and fulfilling day.<br>
I really thought we'd wrap it up after just a walk – then we went to the city and played the claw machine together.<br>
You even showed me how surprisingly good you are at nabbing those plushies.<br>
<br>
She gestures toward the spoils – the two plastic bags she just put on the floor, stuffed with stuffed animals.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lützow：</span><br>
Oh, right, check this seal plushie out.<br>
See that? Doesn't it look just like you?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Did you get that plushie just because of that dream you had?<br>
Moreover – and I've been wondering this the whole time – how am I like a seal?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lützow：</span><br>
Just in terms of looks. Vaguely. You're also both gentle and lovable.<br>
<br>
She holds the plushie in front of her again, as if to lend weight to her argument.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lützow：</span><br>
I think you should have it.<br>
Hug it when you go to sleep and you might even dream of the sea just like me.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Hmm. Then it's only fair that I give you something, too.<br>
<br>
I excavate a pillow from under the pile of stuffed animals.<br>
It's a shark pillow, looking like it's soundly asleep.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lützow：</span><br>
Whoa! When did you get that? I'm pretty sure that wasn't in any of the claw machines we played.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I got it while you went off to exchange for tokens.<br>
Then I hid it under the other plushies so I could surprise you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lützow：</span><br>
Aww, you're so sweet. Thanks.<br>
<br>
She stuffs the stuffed seal into my arms, then with joy accepts my shark pillow.<br>
Rubbing her cheek against its fluffy surface, she gently runs her finger along its sleepy eyes.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lützow：</span><br>
A soft little shark that likes to sleep... That's kinda like me.<br>
*yaaawn*... You know what? This sleep talk has actually made me eepy for realsies.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I could fetch some stuff that'll turbocharge your urge to sleep. Want me to do that?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lützow：</span><br>
Sure. Thanks a bunch.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
A cup of hot chocolate, some sleep-promoting scented candles, a speaker playing white noise...<br>
Yep, that should be everything.<br>
<br>
After confirming all is in order, I quietly open the door to her bedroom.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Lüt–<br>
<br>
Alas, there she is – in bed, eyes already closed, softly snoring.<br>
And hugging her shark pillow with a small smile on her face.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(All that prep was for nothing, but that's fine. She finally managed to fall asleep. I'll just stay a little while longer.)<br>
(Ah, wait, I should go and fetch my unfinished work.)<br>
<br>
Without making a sound, I leave her bedroom and walk out of her home.<br>

Sweet Dreams, Come Back to Me<br>
<br>
6 Night Watch<br>
Port - Lützow's Bedroom<br>
Lützow seemed to be sleeping like a log – until she opened her eyes.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lützow：</span><br>
Dang. That didn't work...<br>
I had to pretend to be asleep so the Commander wouldn't worry over nothing.<br>
Hmm. Maybe I have to try a little harder.<br>
<br>
After their midday stroll and some effort on her part, she finally began to drift off.<br>
In her half-awake state, she could swear she heard the door quietly open.<br>
It felt like a familiar figure snuggled up beside her, but maybe that was just a figment of her tired mind.<br>
She opened her eyes once more.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lützow：</span><br>
*sigh*... Figures. Like that would happen.<br>
That had to be a dream... The Commander's already left.<br>
Man... Maybe I should've asked the Commander to stay with me instead of pretending to be asleep.<br>
It'd sure beat being alone right now...<br>
<br>
As she daydreamed with the shark pillow in her arms, she suddenly realized there was light peeking through the crack in the door.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lützow：</span><br>
Huh? Why's the light on?<br>
<br>
With curiosity and a tinge of hope in her heart, she got up and left her bedroom.<br>
As soon as she opened the door, her mouth was left agape at the sight before her.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lützow：</span><br>
(C-Commander?)<br>
<br>
Indeed – there was the Commander, head resting on the table, illuminated by the soft glow of a desk lamp and surrounded by a pile of paperwork.<br>
Although a dash of fatigue could be seen on that usually-clear expression, Lützow felt strangely at ease.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lützow：</span><br>
(So I wasn't just dreaming...)<br>
(You were worried I still couldn't sleep, so you brought your paperwork here and stood at the ready...)<br>
(All those papers... It's my insomnia's fault that the work has piled up like this.)<br>
Hmm... Looks like it's my turn to take care of you. Heheh.<br>
<br>
She took her napping blanket from her couch and placed it on the Commander.<br>
Then, carefully, so as to not make any noise, she grabbed the unfinished documents and began working on them.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lützow：</span><br>
I gotta make myself look good once in a while – can't be lazy all the time. I'll do these for you.<br>
<br>
Under the light cast by the desk lamp, Lützow smiled a small smile that even she wasn't aware of.<br>

Sweet Dreams, Come Back to Me<br>
<br>
7 Good Night, Lützow<br>
Port - Lützow's Quarters<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
……<br>
<br>
As I awake from my slumber, it takes me a hot second to grasp where I am.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lützow：</span><br>
Ahah! Good evening, Commander.<br>
I got all your papers done. You can go back to sleep if you wanna.<br>
<br>
The lamp on her desk paints her in a soft, orange glow.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Evening... Wait, why aren't you asleep?<br>
Ah, did the light keep you up because I forgot to turn it off? Sorry about that.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lützow：</span><br>
Nuh-uh, nothing like that. I was just pretending to be asleep.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
You were pretending?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lützow：</span><br>
Yup. You spent the whole day trying to fix my insomnia, and I didn't want you to leave thinking that you failed.<br>
But hey, let's forget about that. I'm not tired anyway, so I might as well help with your papers, right?<br>
Besides, this is what a secretary's supposed to do to begin with. Sorry for making you work overtime.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
It's alright.<br>
I should be saying sorry. I mean, I fell asleep before you after trying to help with your sleeping problem...<br>
<br>
*grumble*...<br>
Our stomachs both grumble at the same time.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lützow：</span><br>
Ahaha. Sounds like someone's hungry.<br>
Makes sense. I went straight to bed when I got home, and I assume you haven't eaten anything either, right?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Nope. I went to get my paperwork as soon as I saw that you'd gone to sleep.<br>
And after that, I just started chipping away at these.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lützow：</span><br>
That's two of us who've gone without dinner, then.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
There's stuff in the kitchen. I'll make us something to eat.<br>
You can't sleep on an empty stomach, and a snack might be just the thing to make you tired.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lützow：</span><br>
Alright, then I'll help with–<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
No, you can rest in your room and wait. You already worked through so many of these papers for me.<br>
I also need to pay you back for the blanket.<br>
<br>
By the time the food is done and I return, I find Lützow is already asleep on the couch, wrapped under her blanket.<br>
She looks so at rest, her eyelashes moving faintly in rhythm to her breathing.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Looks like she's getting her beauty sleep – for real this time.)<br>
Good night, Lützow.<br>
<br>
Port - Lützow's Quarters<br>
Light crept through the curtains, painting thin shadows on the floor.<br>
Lützow slowly opened her eyes. She then realized that she was in her bed, under bedsheets as opposed to her blanket.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lützow：</span><br>
Mmh... Wait, when'd I move to the bed?<br>
Pretty sure I fell asleep on the couch...<br>
<br>
A glass of still-slightly-warm milk stood on the table beside her bed.<br>
On the glass, there was a post-it note attached.<br>
"I've rescheduled your work for today. You can come in later. Remember to drink your milk."<br>
Unbeknownst even to herself, her lips curved into a tender smile.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lützow：</span><br>
*sigh*... Well, you're the boss...<br>
Back to sleep I go!<br>
<br>
After downing the whole glass of milk, she tightly hugged her shark pillow and dove in under the sheets.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lützow：</span><br>
I'll come to help when I wake up. I promise I won't slack off this time...<br>
<br>
Saying a warm promise under her breath, she once again drifted off into a comfortable slumber.<br>
Her insomnia was finally cured thanks to the Commander's kind and snuggly efforts.<br>
As to the cause of it, who can say...<br>
Perhaps this bout of restlessness came from a place of love – a place even she can't describe with words.<br>
