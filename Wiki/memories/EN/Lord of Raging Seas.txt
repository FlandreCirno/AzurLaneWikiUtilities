<br>
1 The Collapse of Paperwork Mountain<br>
Ägir and I are in my office, organizing the files we need for today's work.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ägir：</span><br>
I put the organized files over here.<br>
...Uh, don't you think there's a little too much work piled up for today?<br>
<br>
She complains, furrowing her brow at the growing pile of files.<br>
Exercise reports, meeting materials, storage manifests, and more have combined into a pile that's about as tall as me.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Nothing we can do about it. That's Monday for you...<br>
Though even I didn't expect there would be this much.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ägir：</span><br>
Pitiful... Fine. I'll just have to help you out, Commander.<br>
Be grateful and worship me. Heheheh♪<br>
<br>
Ägir flips her hair back, gracefully returns to her seat, and resumes her work.<br>
Despite some early issues, she's taken to her secretary work. She does a great job now.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Likewise today. If she weren't here, it would take me until tomorrow to clean up this mountain of documents...)<br>
<br>
I look back at the pile of documents and hardcover folders again.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Welp... Better pick up the pace a little bit.)<br>
<br>
Nighttime comes in seemingly no time, yet the desk is still covered in documents to be worked on.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(No shot of going home without overtime at this point. Just like every other day...)<br>
(But Ägir isn't used to this.)<br>
<br>
I stretch and yawn, not noticing her eyes are fixed on me.<br>
She must be exhausted from the full day of mental work.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Thanks for your help today. I'll do the rest myself, so you go home and get some rest.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ägir：</span><br>
Is that supposed to be a joke? It isn't funny.<br>
<br>
The girl in front of me raises her eyebrows and glares at me, with all the intimidation at the disposal of a god of the sea.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ägir：</span><br>
Do you think I could go home and relax knowing you're here dealing with this? Hmph. I'll make us coffee. Keep to your work.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Aww. I wish she'd just accept the gesture.)<br>
<br>
I surrender and accept her overtime request.<br>
However, as soon as she tries to get up to brew said coffee, there's a problem.<br>
As Ägir rises from her seat, her horn hits the pile of files...<br>
And then, the mountain starts to collapse!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Oh, no! It's gonna fall all over her!)<br>
<br>
My body moves before my brain does. I seize her arm and yank her out of the way.<br>
The pile falls apart, scattering documents all over the floor. That means we'll have to start reorganizing from the very beginning...<br>
But at least Ägir isn't hurt.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Are you okay?<br>
<br>
I think I've managed to pull her to safety, but just in case, I decide to ask.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ägir：</span><br>
Huh...?<br>
<br>
Ägir looks confused in my arms. It's as if she doesn't quite understand what just happened.<br>
After all, she's basically nuzzling my chest from the momentum of my pulling her close.<br>
Her chest rises and falls with her heavy breathing, and her skin flushes red in the blink of an eye.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ägir：</span><br>
Commander... Y-you...!<br>
<br>
Her confusion doesn't last long. She breaks free from my arms and lunges behind the couch.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Is she embarrassed, or...? Wait, now isn't the time to be thinking about that.)<br>
<br>
I stoop down and start picking up the scattered documents to give her some space.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ägir：</span><br>
............<br>
<br>
After a while, having apparently recovered from her embarrassment, Ägir quietly watches as I pick up the files.<br>
Unfortunately, it's such a mess that it's impossible to figure out which documents come from which files.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Don't worry. As long as you're okay, that's what matters... For now, let's just get all these documents back together.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ägir：</span><br>
I'll do it. This is enough for me to handle alone.<br>
What about you? Aren't you exhausted? You work too much, so too bad, I'll just have to help.<br>
<br>
She tries her hardest to act composed and tease me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ägir：</span><br>
So YOU rest. The rest is my responsibility.<br>
<br>
After that blunt statement, she forcefully chases me off to the couch for a nap.<br>
And then, she starts picking up the documents all over the floor.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Ägir really feels a sense of responsibility for this...)<br>

Lord of Raging Seas<br>
<br>
2 Round Two<br>
Now, Ägir might've chased me off, but that doesn't mean I can just watch her do all the work.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Forget this. I'm picking up those files first, no matter what she says.)<br>
<br>
Five minutes later...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Man... Five whole minutes just to get the documents back on my desk.)<br>
(Ägir wants to do all of this alone? No way... I need to convince her to let me help.)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ägir：</span><br>
Now, leave the rest to me.<br>
Reorganizing this mountain looks like quite the challenge. Heh... Prepare to witness my power!<br>
<br>
While I think of a way to help her without her noticing, there's a sudden knock at the door.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Oh, yeah! Yesterday, Peter Strasser said she'd come and deliver an exercise report today.)<br>
(Surely she can help us!)<br>
<br>
I sit up straight on the couch and yell to Peter that she can come in.<br>
The moment she hands me the report, I shoot a glance at Ägir and point in her direction.<br>
Peter's confused for a moment, but when she sees the ruler of the sea focused on organizing files, she quickly understands.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Peter Strasser：</span><br>
...Yep, that's the whole report. Sign here if you don't see any problems.<br>
Also... Ägir, I know a more efficient way to sort those. Want some advice?<br>
<br>
Peter smoothly changes the subject to Ägir's work.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ägir：</span><br>
Very well. Teach me this mystical method of yours!<br>
...But no help allowed.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Peter Strasser：</span><br>
Of course, this is your job. I'm busy, though, so let's get to it.<br>
<br>
Thanks to Peter Strasser's lecture, Ägir's organizing work approaches its end after just one short hour of valiant battle.<br>
While Ägir's efforts reach their climax, Peter informs me that she needs to talk in private, so we step out of my office.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Peter Strasser：</span><br>
Heehee. You seemed like you had something to say before.<br>
I asked you out here to find out what that was. If you need to say something, go on and say it. My scheduled reporting time is coming to an end.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
You've got a keen intuition, Peter. It's about Ägir...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Peter Strasser：</span><br>
Oh, is that all? You want to build a better relationship with her? To me, it seems like you two are getting along just fine.<br>
If that still isn't enough for you, then why not give her a nice little present?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
A present... Like jewelry, or something?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Peter Strasser：</span><br>
Exactly. I'm sure you can come up with a good gift like it's nothing.<br>
Wow, though. Coming to me about this... Heehee♪<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Hmm?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Peter Strasser：</span><br>
Oh, nothing. Good luck to you, Commander.<br>
<br>
With that, Peter leaves.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Okay... Time to get back to helping Ägir.)<br>

<br>
3 A Quiet Moment<br>
After Peter Strasser's exit, I go back into the office.<br>
Thanks to Ägir's help sorting the files, work that could've taken all night to do has been finished as early as midnight.<br>
I look at the desk she's working at.<br>
She's sitting with her head in her hands, plumb tired.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ägir：</span><br>
What's wrong, Commander? Got something to say? You may speak.<br>
<br>
Noticing my eyes on her, she returns to her usual imperious demeanor.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
If I didn't have you here, today would've been a lot more difficult.<br>
I'm really happy you were here with me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ägir：</span><br>
Wha...?! Ahem! If you think so, then perhaps you should provide an offering to the lord of the abyss?<br>
If you won't, then I expect some other means of recompense.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
An offering, huh... Let me think about it.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：How about we go out to eat together?</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：Wanna go shopping with me?</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''I know a nice restaurant here at port. Let's go on our next day off.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ägir：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Heehee... One meal is far from enough to sate my hunger...<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''But if that is your heartfelt offering, then I'll accept.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Next time we're off, how about we splurge a little?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ägir：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Ooh, shopping? Do you plan to buy me something? But what I want is...<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Commander, you'd better prepare yourself. Heehee♪<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ägir：</span><br>
I see you trying to be alone with me on our day off.<br>
The very definition of a date... Was this your plan from the start?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Yeah. It's a date.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ägir：</span><br>
G-gah...! How direct! W-wait, are you serious?!<br>
<br>
Her bravado disappears in an instant. She's totally shaken by my response.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
When have I not been serious?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ägir：</span><br>
N-no fair! You don't play fair, Commander!<br>
<br>
After that, we make arrangements to go out together, and another hard day of work comes to an end.<br>

<br>
4 Shrinking the Distance<br>
As usual, Ägir and I are hard at work in my office today.<br>
As I watch her immerse herself in work, Peter's advice from the other day flashes through my mind.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(A little present, huh...)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ägir：</span><br>
Commander?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Jewelry that matches her vibe, but isn't too overstated, sounds nice...)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ägir：</span><br>
Commander? Bold of you to let your mind wander when you're faced with me.<br>
<br>
While I'm thinking of the perfect gift, Ägir has sidled over to my side without my noticing.<br>
I don't come to my senses until her silver hair grazes my cheek.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ägir：</span><br>
What in the world could you be thinking about? It's rare for you to be so distracted from signing documents.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：I was thinking about you, actually.</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：Just thinking about what I have to do after this.</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Just... thinking about the date, y'know.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ägir：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''B-but it's a mere date. Are you that excited about it?!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''I just don't want to burden you too much. Rely on me a little more, okay?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ägir：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Wh-what's gotten into you?! Shouldn't YOU be the one to rely on ME?! Do not underestimate a god, mortal!<br>
<br>
After shouting at me, she looks down to hide her rapidly blushing cheeks.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ägir：</span><br>
Ahem... About that date we planned, I've changed my mind a little.<br>
<br>
She looks back up and gazes into my eyes. Her tone is a little stilted.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Oh? You don't want to go on a date with me anymore?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ägir：</span><br>
That's not it! I just want to change the time and location a little.<br>
For example... today! I say we finish up work and then go for a walk on the beach together!<br>
So if you don't finish your work right away, you'll answer to the wrath of raging seas!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Well, I can hardly refuse a demand from the lord of the sea.<br>
<br>
Thanks to Ägir's perfect sorting work, we finish today's work nice and fast.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ägir：</span><br>
Now, shall we go? It's the perfect time to feel the sea breeze, and the sun won't burn us this late in the day.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Phew... Yeah, good idea.<br>
<br>
With my coat in hand, I follow her out of my office.<br>

5 The Sea God's Invitation<br>
After leaving my office, we head to the beach.<br>
Ägir walks just a bit faster than me. She relaxes in the soft sand and the gentle sea breeze.<br>
Her serene figure brings a smile to my face.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ägir：</span><br>
What now? Is something funny to you?<br>
<br>
She whips around and takes me by surprise.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Just watching you, I couldn't help myself.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ägir：</span><br>
Is that so? Dare I presume that you were taken by the sight of me?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Good presumption.</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Yeah, I sure was.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ägir：</span><br>
Wha...?! Now you're just trying to be rude by being so direct!<br>
<br>
She immediately turns away in a futile attempt to hide how flustered she is.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Now, at this point...)<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：(Walk side by side with her.)</span>'''''<br>
<br>
I jog to catch up with her and align my footsteps with hers.<br>
Ägir's unnaturally silent, but eventually, she reaches her hand over and intertwines her fingers with mine.<br>
Her soft, slender fingers cling tight, showing her unwillingness to let me go.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ägir：</span><br>
Heheh. Be careful now, Commander. You wouldn't want to be engulfed by the violent waters.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Even if I was, you'd come and save me, wouldn't you?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ägir：</span><br>
Hmph...! If you beg for help, maybe!<br>
<br>
She tightens her grip on my hand even further.<br>
Thus, the two of us enjoy our walk together, touched by the sea breeze.<br>

<br>
6 Prelude to Party<br>
Ever since our beach date, Ägir started coming to my office before work hours every time she got the chance.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(She calls it a favor for a friend, but...)<br>
<br>
I think about it along the way to my office.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Is she still not here yet? Hmm... There's something on my desk.)<br>
<br>
There's a folded card on the table with my name on it.<br>
As for the contents...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(A party held by the Northern Parliament and Iron Blood... tonight?)<br>
(Is this an invitation? I'll have to ask Ägir later.)<br>
<br>
Before long, Ägir comes back to the office.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ägir：</span><br>
Commander, have you already read the invitation I left for you?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I was just about to ask you about that, actually.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ägir：</span><br>
Yes, I was the one who left it there. I also left the office because I was off making arrangements, as well.<br>
But don't worry. There's no dress code. It's a simple, casual get-together.<br>
I've seen with my own two eyes how you've been exhausting yourself of late. It's about time you kick back and relax for once.<br>
But let's be serious for a moment. You never had the right to refuse a god such as myself, did you?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Alright. I'll avail myself of your kind offer.<br>
<br>
I accept her invitation, and we resume our work.<br>
Thus begins the start of another busy day.<br>
After the day's work is done, Ägir leaves early in order to prepare for the party. She is the host, after all.<br>
I already told her that I'd catch up with her later.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Finally, a free moment to myself. Time to pick a present and get it for her.<br>
<br>
In the port shopping area, the jewelry shop is chock full of dazzling and eye-catching goods.<br>
I scour the entire store, not missing a single display.<br>
Just then, an elaborate amber necklace catches my eye.<br>
That charming golden stone encased in resin, the sparkle of it – they remind me of her enchanting eyes.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
That's it. I'm picking this one!<br>

When I arrive, the party is already booming with activity.<br>
I pass by drinking friends and find Ägir on the second-floor terrace.<br>
She drinks the amber liquid in her cup all at once and looks over at me with pure composure.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ägir：</span><br>
Commander, it's not nice to make a girl wait.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Sorry.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ägir：</span><br>
A god, waiting for one single human... Do you think you can afford to make up for this affront?<br>
<br>
While she teases me, she gets closer and rests her chin on my shoulder.<br>
I feel her hot breath on my ear as she wraps an arm around my waist.<br>
The people downstairs know nothing about what's going on. Before they can find out, I reach into my pocket and hold the package inside.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Actually... I have a gift I'd like to give you...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ägir：</span><br>
Oh? So you are ready to pay the price. Go on. Show me what you've got.<br>
<br>
I take out the box, open the lid, and show her the amber necklace within.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
It's not to make up for making you wait, though. It's just a gift.<br>
I had trouble finding out what to give you, but I thought this would suit you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ägir：</span><br>
Wait a second... This isn't what you were whispering about with Peter, is it?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Huh? You figured me out that easily?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ägir：</span><br>
Of course I did!<br>
That's not the only reason! Lately, you've constantly had your mind elsewhere. You keep looking at me and smiling, too. This is why, isn't it?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I do know I've been distracted, but did I really smile that much?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ägir：</span><br>
That's not what matters! You... You've been after this from the very start!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Wait... Oh. Do you mean back during our date?<br>
<br>
She doesn't answer. Instead, she just glares at me angrily.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
No, I didn't accept just for the sake of this. I only told the truth back on the beach.<br>
I just like you a lot, that's all.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ägir：</span><br>
Y-you little...!<br>
<br>
Ägir blushes madly, grabs the closest lemon water she can find, and gulps it all down at once.<br>
It takes a while after that for her to finally calm down.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ägir：</span><br>
If you mean that... then hurry up and put it on me.<br>
<br>
The proud lord of the sea lowers her head for me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ägir：</span><br>
Surely you don't mean to make me do it myself. Don't make me wait any longer.<br>
<br>
I take the necklace and gently put it around her neck.<br>
The stylish gold matches her reds and blacks, drawing out her gold eyes even more and adding a touch of charm to her.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ägir：</span><br>
Hey... Commander.<br>
<br>
She wraps her arm back around my waist, holds me tight, and pulls me close to her.<br>
This time, we're pushed up so close together that we can feel each other's breathing.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ägir：</span><br>
You're going to pay a high price for shackling me, Commander.<br>
In fact... Don't even dream of getting away before sunrise... Heehee♥<br>
