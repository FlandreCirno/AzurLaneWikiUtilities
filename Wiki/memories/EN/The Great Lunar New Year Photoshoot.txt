The Great Lunar New Year Photoshoot<br>
<br>
1. The Dragon Empery Estate<br>
Port - Nearing the Spring Festival<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hai Chi：</span><br>
Tadaaaaah~! Our Dragon Empery-style estate is all finished! From the interior to the courtyard, everything's... absolutely... perfect!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hai Tien：</span><br>
"In the riverside garden of apricot trees, flowers bloom overnight in the spring breeze. A myriad of colors blend, reflected in ripples of green."<br>
Such a splendid scenery was made possible due to Miss Yat Sen's proposal, the hard work of all our friends, and the generous support of the Commander.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hai Chi：</span><br>
Next up... is to make our paradise open to the public!<br>
I'm really looking forward to seeing the reactions on everyone's faces! I bet they're gonna love it!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hai Tien：</span><br>
Naturally. But lest we put the cart before the horse, we'll have to find ways of attracting more people to visit.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chen Hai：</span><br>
Precisely. We'll need to devise a stratagem to quickly increase our name recognition.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hai Chi：</span><br>
Hmm... Maybe we could get up on stage and start banging gongs and drums?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hai Tien：</span><br>
A plausible idea in theory, but if we don't make enough noise, people won't be able to hear us.<br>
On the other hand, if we make too much noise... we're going to end up being a public nuisance. Maybe the drums aren't such a great idea after all...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hai Chi：</span><br>
Ugh, you have a point, but... simply handing out flyers feels way too boring, y'know?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hai Tien：</span><br>
I suppose something too pedestrian wouldn't get the point across. This is supposed to be a major celebration after all.<br>
Let's try going about this differently. In your opinion, what do you think is the most appealing aspect of our Dragon Empery estate?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hai Chi：</span><br>
...It's huge!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chen Hai：</span><br>
Well, yes, but so are a lot of other things... Don't you mean, the scenery?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hai Tien：</span><br>
Indeed, Chen Hai is absolutely correct. What we can offer is a breathtaking view you can't get elsewhere.<br>
If we can capture the very best views and publicize them properly, we'll be able to give everyone a glimpse of the scenery they'll be able to witness here.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hai Chi：</span><br>
Hrmmmm... That makes sense.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chen Hai：</span><br>
That's fine and all, but promoting the "scenery" alone may not do justice to the sights we have to offer.<br>
Since time immemorial, aesthetes have paired the most beautiful scenery nature has to offer with the most beautiful women. But how do we go about finding these beautiful women...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hai Chi：</span><br>
How about the three of us? I reckon we're good enough!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hai Tien：</span><br>
*cough*... I appreciate the sentiment, but I can hardly be considered "beautiful"...<br>
But I guess if we just need models, we should be able to grab some of our friends from the Dragon Empery.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chen Hai：</span><br>
Just from the Dragon Empery? Since our purpose is to have as many people visit as possible, wouldn't it make more sense to cooperate with our friends from all over the world?<br>
Let them don the most spectacular garments of the Dragon Empery so we may take pictures of them throughout our little paradise. That way, they can become beauties that truly represent the union of heaven and earth.<br>
And in the process, we'll also be promoting the peerless beauty of the Dragon Empery's traditional attire! Hehehe...<br>
Finally, we can use the photoshoot to create lots of promotional materials to get even more people to come visit us!<br>
Through this fortuitous cycle of events, our reputation will spread far and wide~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hai Chi：</span><br>
Oh, so basically, "throwing bricks to attract jade!"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chen Hai：</span><br>
Nobody would consider the precious photos of their friends to be "bricks," would they?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hai Tien：</span><br>
Hai Chi, it's not like we're running a pyramid scheme here...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hai Chi：</span><br>
...Oh.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chen Hai：</span><br>
Well, whatever. As for its name, why don't we go with "Spring Festival Paradise Photoshoot?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hai Chi：</span><br>
Paradise, huh? That has a nice ring to it. I like it!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hai Tien：</span><br>
Chen Hai, who do you think our first model should be?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chen Hai：</span><br>
I'll be glad to tell you, if you don't mind running a little errand for me~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hai Chi：</span><br>
Ooh, pick me! What do you need me to do?<br>

<br>
2. A Chemical Concoction?<br>
Port - Dragon Empery Estate<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chen Hai：</span><br>
(The first photoshoot was of Miss U-73 from the Iron Blood, and if I recall, she was supposed to be in the study near the entrance...)<br>
(Oh my, what is this wonderful herbal aroma...?)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-73：</span><br>
Happy Lunar New Year, Miss Chen Hai!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chen Hai：</span><br>
Happy Lunar New Year to you too. May I ask what you're doing with this entire set, Miss U-73?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-73：</span><br>
A classical backdrop coupled with modern scientific instruments – a marriage of tradition and modernity!<br>
Oh right, Hai Chi told me earlier, you were planning on taking some photos for promotional purposes, right? So, I moved some stuff around in the room.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chen Hai：</span><br>
I must say, you've arranged the scenery and props in a refreshingly novel way.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-73：</span><br>
Heh heh, who said this was a prop? This labware's actually the real deal~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chen Hai：</span><br>
Then, this herbal aroma filling the room is also...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-73：</span><br>
My sister's carefully-crafted, Lunar New Year special concoction!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chen Hai：</span><br>
Mm... It certainly has a rather "modern" scent to it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-73：</span><br>
I can assure you, this aroma meets all our specifications. As for the taste... yeah, it should be fine too.<br>
I did add in some herbs, but this formula doesn't include any artificial additives.<br>
After we're done with our photoshoot, everyone should give this special tea a try!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chen Hai：</span><br>
Hehe. I'm looking forward to it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-73：</span><br>
If you like how it tastes, think you could put in a good word for my chemis-tea?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hai Chi：</span><br>
Miss U-73, we're done setting up the equipment! Ready whenever you are!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-73：</span><br>
I'll be done in a sec! Now then, let's do that photoshoot~♪<br>

<br>
3. The Flying General Approaches!<br>
Port - Dragon Empery Estate<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chen Hai：</span><br>
(Some snow was shovelled into the courtyard for use as part of a prop set.)<br>
(My, what's that sound...?)<br>
(Hoofsteps? They're getting closer too.)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">???：</span><br>
You over there! Identify yourself!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chen Hai：</span><br>
I am Chen Hai, strategist to the Dragon Empery. It is an honor to meet the Flying General of the Keystone State in person.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pennsylvania：</span><br>
......Uhh, come again?<br>
I didn't expect you to give me an answer like that with a straight face. I'm not sure what I'm supposed to say, haha.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chen Hai：</span><br>
Today's photoshoot set is quite a faithful reproduction, if I must say so myself.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hai Tien：</span><br>
"The north wind blows, the fountaingrass folds. In the eighth month falls winter's cold." ...Though, we'll be leaving winter behind soon.<br>
How do you like the set that Hai Chi and I put together?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chen Hai：</span><br>
I suppose this is "the spring breeze arriving on the dancing snow." I wonder if this set is supposed to represent the White Gate Tower.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hai Tien：</span><br>
Oh, speaking of the Flying General...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pennsylvania：</span><br>
The White Gate Tower? What's that?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chen Hai：</span><br>
Oh, don't worry about it. The White Gate Tower marked the winter of the Dragon Empery's Flying General, but your outfit seems inspired by another brave general 300 years prior.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pennsylvania：</span><br>
I see. You learn something new every day! But I have no doubts that both of those Flying Generals were heroic and fierce!<br>
But uh, this is the place I was supposed to come for the photoshoot, right? And the lines I was supposed to memorize went something like...<br>
"Pennsylvania, the Keystone General, has arrived!"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hai Tien：</span><br>
––Thank you very much! That was a fantastic shot!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chen Hai：</span><br>
A fierce general painting her legacy onto a pristine, snow-white landscape... This concept will surely win over hearts and minds.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hai Chi：</span><br>
Yup! We'll have to make sure to thank Akashi later for providing a snow machine and the horse!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chen Hai：</span><br>
Wait... Akashi... did all that for free?<br>
That must be a saga for the ages. You must tell me more about it later.<br>

<br>
4. Wandering Beyond the Boundaries<br>
Port - Dragon Empery Estate<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bristol：</span><br>
Miss Chen Hai, is th-th-this spot okay?<br>
I, umm... I think I'm p-p-perfectly relaxed now!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chen Hai：</span><br>
(She says that, but she looks about as relaxed as a coiled spring...)<br>
(If anything, telling her to relax is only going to end up being counterproductive. In that case...)<br>
Miss Bristol, I heard you have a knack for adventuring. Do you think you'd be able to picture some place you'd like to explore?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bristol：</span><br>
Picture... an adventure?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chen Hai：</span><br>
Anything will do. The sky's the limit.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hai Tien：</span><br>
Hmm... That's an interesting proposal. Bristol, have you ever heard the tale of Carefree Wandering?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chen Hai：</span><br>
Ah, yes. Now, Bristol, please close your eyes and listen to the story I'm about to tell you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bristol：</span><br>
Um, okay! I'll give it a try!<br>
<br>
Bristol closed her eyes, and Hai Tien began to tell her an ancient tale from the Dragon Empery.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hai Tien：</span><br>
"In the northern deeps lived the Kun, its length several thousand li immeasurable."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chen Hai：</span><br>
Once upon a time in the waters of the North, there lived a fish of mythical proportions called the Kun.<br>
It was said to have been thousands of li in length, a veritable living island.<br>
You land upon the Kun's back as it drifts across the ocean, seemingly without purpose.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bristol：</span><br>
Woahh... I can already picture how epic that is...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hai Tien：</span><br>
"Into a Peng it transforms, its length several thousand li immeasurable. When it takes flight, its wings are clouds that blanket the skies."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chen Hai：</span><br>
Suddenly, the island beneath your feet begins to tremble. When you look around you, the fish has turned into a massive bird that then takes off to the skies.<br>
The water that splashes from its wings when it takes flight rains down from the skies, its huge wings like clouds that descend over the land.<br>
You cling to its body desperately as to not be thrown from its back––<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bristol：</span><br>
Woaaah!! I'm gonna fall!!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chen Hai：</span><br>
You do not know how long it has been, but the bird finally stops its ascension and begins to glide serenely across the sky.<br>
You finally let go and begin to relax. Small birds chirp and gather at your sides, clamoring to play with you.<br>
You reach into your pocket for a straw, and start to blow colorful little bubbles for them.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bristol：</span><br>
Fwooh...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hai Chi：</span><br>
––Now that's a photo-worthy expression! Thank you very much!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chen Hai：</span><br>
Yes, excellently done. Bristol, you can now open your eyes.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bristol：</span><br>
Wait... I can see something in the clouds...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hai Chi：</span><br>
Oh? What might you be seeing?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bristol：</span><br>
There's some kind of rainbow-colored cone coming out of the clouds... It seems to be rising up about ten feet, with a diameter about that wide as well...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hai Tien：</span><br>
A rainbow-colored cone... Wait, hold on a sec!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bristol：</span><br>
I... I can't look away from it!<br>
The cone seems to be covered with strange, uneven scales of some sort...<br>
At the top of the cone, there's four retractable organs... W-woah, that looks like some kind of evil creature!<br>
Let's go, giant Kun! Let's go fight it together!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hai Tien：</span><br>
You can come back to reality now, Miss Bristol. Our time's almost up~<br>
<br>
And thus, another photoshoot was completed successfully.<br>

<br>
5. Poetry in the Park<br>
Port - Dragon Empery Estate<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chen Hai：</span><br>
There's plenty of time until the next photoshoot, so maybe I'll take a stroll around the park.<br>
Who's that in the pavilion at the center of the pond?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hai Tien：</span><br>
...Yesterday's snow has made this pavilion even more picturesque.<br>
But alas... the snow here has already thinned out significantly.<br>
Hey, Hai Chi, bring the snow machine over here for a bit––<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hai Chi：</span><br>
Sure, sure! One snowstorm, coming right up!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hai Tien：</span><br>
Great~ That looks much better!<br>
Ahh, the sparse remnants of autumn leaves in the white snow make this scenery feel all that much more poetic...<br>
*Achoo!* Um, Hai Chi, please don't point the snow machine directly at me!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hai Chi：</span><br>
Ehehe, I thought you wanted to know what it felt like to be in the middle of a snowstorm!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hai Tien：</span><br>
Just the general mood is good enough! Jeez, you're going to blow all the leaves away! Just a thin layer of snow is sufficient.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hai Chi：</span><br>
Fiiiiine...<br>
<br>
Hai Tien paced back and forth in the artificial snow, her lips curled into a slight frown.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hai Tien：</span><br>
Let's see, the first verse... "One paces amidst the park's sleet and snow, the last traces of fall reflected in the pond."<br>
That sounds pretty good. Now for the next verse...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yat Sen：</span><br>
Good afternoon, everyone.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ping Hai：</span><br>
Hello, hello! We're here to play!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ning Hai：</span><br>
Hope we're not bothering you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hai Tien：</span><br>
Oh my, it's good to see the three of you. Welcome to my little pavilion. How do you like the view here?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yat Sen：</span><br>
It's quite nice. I like the wintery feel.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ping Hai：</span><br>
Let's have a snowball fight! Hai Chi, Hai Tien, wanna join in?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hai Chi：</span><br>
Let's do it!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hai Tien：</span><br>
I'm trying to compose a poem for the occasion. Apologies, but I'm afraid I must decline.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hai Chi：</span><br>
Hope you find the right words soon!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yat Sen：</span><br>
I see. I was wondering if something was bothering you from the way you were pacing back and forth, but you were just trying to come up with some poetry.<br>
Would you mind sharing what you've come up with so far?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hai Tien：</span><br>
Sure. I'm only about halfway through, but it goes like this– "One paces amidst the park's sleet and snow, the last traces of fall reflected in the pond."<br>
I'm not sure how to continue from here though.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yat Sen：</span><br>
Hmm... It seems to convey a sense of sorrow and loss.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hai Tien：</span><br>
That's usually the kind of mood you're going for in a wintry setting like this.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yat Sen：</span><br>
Look, do you notice something about the tips of these branches?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hai Tien：</span><br>
The branches...? Oh, you're talking about the plum trees...<br>
Oh, I get it now. I was so fixated at looking down at the water that I didn't notice what was above me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yat Sen：</span><br>
To me, the plum tree branches represent what this place will soon become – brimming with new life once our friends come to visit.<br>
Don't you think this wintry pavilion is just as suitable for enjoying the company of friends while appreciating the plum blossoms and sipping tea?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hai Tien：</span><br>
Ah, you're right! And you've given me the perfect idea!<br>
Continuing on... "At the lonesome branches of winter's end, from rosy buds spring life anew."<br>
Wow, that has a nice ring to it!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chen Hai：</span><br>
Hehe, and that's another wonderful picture taken!<br>
Though it's not very nice to do take pictures of someone without their permission, the scenery here is simply so splendid that I'll have to ask for forgiveness later.<br>

6. At Home?<br>
Port - Dragon Empery Estate<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Charybdis：</span><br>
Miss Chen Hai, how does this look?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chen Hai：</span><br>
Oh my, Miss Charybdis... What a daring look you're sporting.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Charybdis：</span><br>
Hm? Did you not request that I wear something capturing the spirit of being "at home?"<br>
To me, that means something that conveys a sense of peace and comfort, something that soothes your spirits the moment you walk through the door no matter how tired you might be. Isn't that right?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chen Hai：</span><br>
You're right. Did you have a particular pose in mind?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Charybdis：</span><br>
I did, actually. How about getting ready to clean the Com– I mean, the Master's ears?<br>
After a long day of work, the Master returns home exhausted, but finds sanctuary in my lap~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chen Hai：</span><br>
Mm, that's quite interesting. Combining our culture with the Royal Maids' spirit of service.<br>
If you don't mind, I'd like to take the picture now.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Charybdis：</span><br>
Not at all. Thank you very much.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chen Hai：</span><br>
We're all done with the photoshoot. Thank you so much for coming, Miss Charybdis.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
Good job, nya~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Charybdis：</span><br>
You're very welcome. The Royal Maids are here to help after all~♪<br>
By the way, Akashi, what brings you here?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
It's nothing major, nya. Akashi simply came by to check the site of another potential store branch.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Charybdis：</span><br>
I see... By the way, can I take these props back with me? I think I might actually want to try servicing the Master a little bit~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chen Hai：</span><br>
That's fine by me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Charybdis：</span><br>
Thank you very much! If you don't need anything else from me, I shall take my leave~<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hai Tien：</span><br>
Yes, everyone looks like they're having a great time.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chen Hai：</span><br>
Now that our strategy has been set in motion, all that remains is to see things through to the end.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hai Chi：</span><br>
I wanna go have fun with everyone else!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chen Hai：</span><br>
Sure, but we need to finish our work here first.<br>
As the organizers of this event, we're in charge of making sure everything here continues to run smoothly. And I trust more work will be on its way.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ying Swei：</span><br>
Oh, there you girls are!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chen Hai：</span><br>
Hehe. Right on schedule.<br>
Did you need us for something, Ying Swei?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ying Swei：</span><br>
Umm, I know you've been busy setting up over here, but do you think you could lend me a hand in finishing the Spring Festival banquet preparations?<br>
