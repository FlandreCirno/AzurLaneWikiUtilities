Chapter 1: The Secretary Ship<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck：</span><br>
My sister... I'm sorry.<br>
I hope you'll forgive me for what I did...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tirpitz：</span><br>
That dream again... How many times does that make it...<br>
... Now is not the time to be sentimental.<br>
The Commander... still hasn't arrived. Perhaps I should start with work that even a secretary could take care of. First would be the reports entrusted to me, and...<br>
<br>
When I arrived at the office, my secretary, Tirpitz, had already begun her duties.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tirpitz：</span><br>
Good morning, Commander. You've arrived.<br>
Perfect timing. Please check today's tasks and schedule. If there are any problems, I will fix them.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Receive the documents.</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tirpitz：</span><br>
Also, I've dealt with some of the work regarding fleet operations that you gave me yesterday.<br>
<br>
Come to think of it, the stack of papers that was piled up neatly on the desk is...<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Thank Tirpitz.</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tirpitz：</span><br>
There's no reason to thank me for something this insignificant. I'm only doing what's expected of me as the secretary.<br>
<br>
Tirpitz returned to work.<br>
As expected of the exemplar ship of the Iron Blood, there's really nothing to criticize about her work.<br>
But... why do I somewhat feel like I'm being kept at an arm's distance...?<br>

Chapter 2: Mission<br>
Tirpitz was planning to deliver old equipment to Yuubari at the Research Department.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tirpitz：</span><br>
As I thought, it's impossible to carry everything in one trip... It'd be better to split this up into multiple trips.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">???：</span><br>
You seem troubled! Fear not, for Justice is here! The Little Beavers are here to save the day!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tirpitz：</span><br>
What...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">???：</span><br>
So you wanted to deliver these to Yuubari, right?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tirpitz：</span><br>
Umm, who might you be...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">???：</span><br>
I am Charles Ausburne, ally of justice and Captain of the Little Beavers! Wait here for a second, I'll go and gather everyone!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Charles Ausburne：</span><br>
Little Beavers, assemble-!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Aulick：</span><br>
Kaay, I'm here~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Spence：</span><br>
D-Did something happen?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Foote：</span><br>
What a pain...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Charles Ausburne：</span><br>
Everyone, let's work together and carry all this to Yuubari's Research Department!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tirpitz：</span><br>
Wait, this is the secretary ship's duty. I'm fine doing this on my-<br>
<br>
As if to cut Tirpitz off, the members of the Little Beavers quickly lifted the equipment onto a trolley and departed.<br>
Tirpitz, who was carrying equipment alongside them, seemed to be thinking about something.<br>
Port - Research Department<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Charles Ausburne：</span><br>
With this, Justice has been served! Little Beavers, out!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tirpitz：</span><br>
I give you my thanks. I shall let the Commander know of your help.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Charles Ausburne：</span><br>
Hey, no need for something like that! Justice demands no recompense!<br>
Besides, isn't it obvious that comrades should help each other out? Everyone else does the same!<br>
Well, I'll be leaving then! More Justice awaits!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tirpitz：</span><br>
I'm... a comrade... Alright, I get it.<br>
<br>
Watching the Little Beavers until they disappeared, Tirpitz began walking.<br>

Chapter 3: Practice Exercise<br>
Port - Exercise Area<br>
Today is the day of the Iron Blood joint exercise.<br>
Without batting so much as an eyelid, Tirpitz aimed a shell perfectly at the target ship that was being controlled by the Manjuu.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Well done.</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tirpitz：</span><br>
Thank you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Tirpitz, you sure are amazing~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tirpitz：</span><br>
Oh, it's Eugen... My aim is nothing praiseworthy. You and Hipper are also doing quite well, aren't you?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
My, aren't you modest. Did you hear that, Hipper? You'd do well to learn from her.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Admiral Hipper：</span><br>
Huh?! Why should I?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Because Tirpitz is tha~at amazing, but look, she's not full of herself at all. Not at all like some blonde, attention-seeking tsundere who begs the Commander to "Praise me! Praise me!" for simply completing a mission~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tirpitz：</span><br>
Knock it off, Eugen. I'm sure Hipper tries in her own...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Admiral Hipper：</span><br>
Huh?! Well, excuuuuse me for being who I am! Eugen! Do you want me to hit you again?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Hehe, what do you think~♪<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Calm Hipper down.</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Admiral Hipper：</span><br>
Commander, you've got nothing to do with this! Eugen! Stay there! Don't run! Today's the day I'll make you understand that I'M the matriarch of the Hipper class!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tirpitz：</span><br>
... Sisters, huh...<br>
<br>
In silence, Tirpitz was pondering over something.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："Tirpitz?"</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tirpitz：</span><br>
... Ah.<br>
Sorry. Without realizing it, I started to wonder if all sisters could become like this.<br>
<br>
Tirpitz displayed a somewhat lonely expression.<br>

Chapter 4: Sortie<br>
Location: Unspecified sea area<br>
At the place the sea patrol fleet that Tirpitz was flagship of was cruising through...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Karl Galster (Z20)：</span><br>
*Sigh*... Boooring... Another day where nothing happens.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hermann Künne (Z19)：</span><br>
Please focus! What are you going to do if the enemy appears right now?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Karl Galster (Z20)：</span><br>
It's fine~ According to recent observation reports, no enemies have appeared in this area for over two weeks~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Wilhelm Heidkamp (Z21)：</span><br>
But, in the one in a million chance...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Karl Galster (Z20)：</span><br>
One in a million basically means it won't happen, you know? *Sigh*... I want this to end quickly so I can go back and go for a run or something...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tirpitz：</span><br>
We'll be arriving at the turnaround point soon. Please prepare for the return journey.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z19&Z20&Z21：</span><br>
Roger!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tirpitz：</span><br>
(What is this unsettling premonition I'm getting...)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hermann Künne (Z19)：</span><br>
I'm getting enemy readings on my radar! It's a Siren destroyer fleet!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Karl Galster (Z20)：</span><br>
With these numbers, I'm not sure that just us destroyers will...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tirpitz：</span><br>
I won't let my comrades be injured...!<br>
<br>
The intense bombardment from her main battery continued for a while.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Karl Galster (Z20)：</span><br>
Holy cow! What was that...?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hermann Künne (Z19)：</span><br>
It was support shelling from Tirpitz... Confirmation of enemy fleet's annihilation!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Wilhelm Heidkamp (Z21)：</span><br>
W-With this we're fine... right?<br>
Tirpitz, thank you...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tirpitz：</span><br>
... It wasn't a big deal.<br>
Let's report this situation to the Commander.<br>
(What... did I...)<br>

Chapter 5: Everyone's Secretary Ship<br>
Port - Office<br>
As usual, Tirpitz was easily and efficiently handling her secretary duties.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tirpitz：</span><br>
Next, organize the observation reports of the sea zones, and update the ones the Sirens have appeared in...<br>
<br>
(Knock knock)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sheffield：</span><br>
Excuse me for intruding while you're busy. I've left Master's and Ms. Tirpitz's black tea over here.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tirpitz：</span><br>
Thanks for your work.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sheffield：</span><br>
Please don't mention it. If anything, Ms. Tirpitz is the one who's always helping me... Excuse me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tirpitz：</span><br>
If you could update the route that is to be patrolled next time based on the predictions of enemy appearances in the various sea zones...<br>
<br>
(Knock knock)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:37}：</span><br>
Hello there. Tirpitz, you really saved me last time. Thanks.<br>
Here, the newest model air purifier. Umm, it's a model that raises work efficiency and promotes good health. I'll leave it here.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tirpitz：</span><br>
Ah, thank you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:37}：</span><br>
There are still things left unfinished at the Research Department, so I'll be heading out.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tirpitz：</span><br>
With this, the patrol route should be... and for the personnel...<br>
<br>
(Knock knock)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cleveland：</span><br>
I'll be coming in~! Ah, Tirpitz! Perfect. I heard the other day that you're interested in bonsai, so I've come today to bring you the gift of bonsai!<br>
I took care of this one pretty carefully. If you look at it when you're tired, you'll feel uplifted and recharged in no time! So, would this be a good place for it?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tirpitz：</span><br>
Sure, that place works.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cleveland：</span><br>
Okay, over here, and... all right. Well, I'll be outta here before I become a bother~ See you later!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tirpitz：</span><br>
...<br>
Don't you think we've been getting more and more visitors lately...?<br>
<br>
Tirpitz didn't seem to know that she was the reason why more people had been visiting.<br>
She didn't seem to realize that she was smiling radiantly in front of everyone.<br>

Port - Office<br>
After being stuck with more work than usual, Tirpitz ended up working until midnight.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tirpitz：</span><br>
I didn't realize that there'd be so much work... I should've done a better job of gauging the workload when I was drawing up plans yesterday...<br>
Commander, thank you for your hard work. Sorry for making you stick with me for so long.<br>
If you're tired, please go ahead and rest. I'll take care of the rest.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Tirpitz, there's something different about you.</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tirpitz：</span><br>
Something... different?<br>
That I've protected the other girls - I was simply doing what I needed to do to maintain my combat power...<br>
That I've worried about you - I was only focusing on improving efficiency as the secretary...<br>
That I've become able to work well with everyone else in the fleet - That is...<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：The ice around you has melted.</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tirpitz：</span><br>
!!<br>
<br>
Tirpitz displayed a rare moment of surprise on her face, and then she said...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tirpitz：</span><br>
The ice... has melted, huh.<br>
Ahh...<br>
Indeed, it might just have... I... haven't forgotten yet...<br>
That's right. If I had been pushing the comrades around me away with a shell of ice, I suppose saying that "the ice had melted" describes it well.<br>
For so long, all I knew was coldness and loneliness, to the point where I thought I had long forgotten the warmth that comes from others, but...<br>
Commander, thank you for reminding me.<br>
<br>
Tirpitz smiled warmly.<br>
As I thought, a smile fits her the best.<br>

Chapter 7: Warmth<br>
After that, some time passed...<br>
Port - Outskirts<br>
Tirpitz invited me to come talk to her, and I ended up somewhere up high at the outskirts of the port.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tirpitz：</span><br>
Sorry for having you come out to a place like this.<br>
The truth is, there's something I wanted to see with you.<br>
<br>
Tirpitz pointed at something shimmering in the sky.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：The North Star?</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tirpitz：</span><br>
Yes, the Polarstern.<br>
Whenever I look at this star, I'm reminded of my past... that time I was locked down in port, a "fleet in name only."<br>
I spent day after day doing nothing, feeling nothing, just simply used to being cold and alone.<br>
And then, having achieved nothing of note, I met my end, watching the smoke of despair fill the harbor as I welcomed my destruction.<br>
Don't you agree that I had a ridiculous, empty life?<br>
...<br>
But now, things are different.<br>
Now there is the joy of meeting people, and the peace of mind from being with you. And the warmth of it was able to melt away the ice of my past.<br>
"The Lone Queen of the North" is alone no longer.<br>
I pray that the other me in the mirror - and in my dreams - will be as happy as the me here right now...<br>
... I think I'm a little tired.<br>
<br>
I feel the weight of her resting against my shoulder.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tirpitz：</span><br>
Say, would you mind if I pull up closer to you...?<br>
I want to feel your warmth for a little bit longer...<br>
<br>
Tirpitz's warm voice, almost in a whisper, filled your ears.<br>
I hope she stays this gentle, now and forever.<br>
