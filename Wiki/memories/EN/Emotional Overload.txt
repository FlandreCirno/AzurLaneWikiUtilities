Emotional Overload<br>
<br>
1 The Guardian Blade, the Impeccable Secretary<br>
A girl was prancing down the corridor to the Commander's office.<br>
Though her eyes were covered by a mask, her wide smile and the cheerful tune she hummed gave away her mood.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alsace：</span><br>
Hmm-hm-hmm-hm♪<br>
Oh, Alsace, so cool you'll be♪<br>
Purging baddies all so fearlessly♪<br>
And today you are the secretary♪<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Épée：</span><br>
H-hi, Alsace. Good morning.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fleuret：</span><br>
About to start working as the secretary, huh? Maaan, you're so lucky.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alsace：</span><br>
Affirmative! The Commander wills it. You needn't be envious, Fleuret – work hard, and one is sure you'll get your own opportunity.<br>
<br>
Alsace addressed the two little knights before her with marked sincerity.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Épée：</span><br>
Um, speaking of hard work... Thanks for the help earlier.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fleuret：</span><br>
Alsace is the one who helped you? When you spilled a drink and poked a hole through the wall when you tried to clean it up.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Épée：</span><br>
Yeah. If it wasn't for her, the Commander would've found out and thought I was worthless...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fleuret：</span><br>
That explains the paint you both had all over your clothes.<br>
Hey, if it happens again, just call the Manjuu repair team. Besides, the Commander's image of you wouldn't shatter like that over a small mistake.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Épée：</span><br>
Y-yeah, you're right...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alsace：</span><br>
You can always come to this one if you have a problem that needs solving.<br>
As the Commander's blade and protector, protecting the port, too, falls under one's umbrella!<br>
Now, one needs to get moving.<br>
<br>
Alsace bowed her head and excused herself, then resumed humming her tune as she proceeded down the corridor.<br>
Fleuret lingered in place, watching Alsace move forward with a tinge of nervousness.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fleuret：</span><br>
Isn't she, like, SUPER sensitive to the Commander? She's probably gonna overheat and break down as soon as she gets near.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Épée：</span><br>
I-I think she'll be okay!<br>
I walked by her room the other day, and I heard her trying to build up tolerance by saying, "Commander, Commander" over and over.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fleuret：</span><br>
"Build up tolerance." Yeah, right...<br>
But you know what? I'll choose to have faith in her self-control and the Commander's smarts!<br>
<br>
Port - Office<br>
Following a knock on the door, Alsace quietly comes into my office.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alsace：</span><br>
This one is battleship Alsace – Sacrament of the Unified Orthodoxy, an unreachable dream, and guardian of the Holy See.<br>
One has trained and become secretary perfection embodied! Now, Commander, one awaits your orders!<br>

<br>
2 It's Okay, One is the Secretary<br>
I brief Alsace on her responsibilities today as my new secretary.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alsace：</span><br>
Understood. Rest assured, one shall handle these tasks competently.<br>
Hmm-hm-hmm♪<br>
<br>
She takes a seat and gets to work as she starts humming a distinctive song.<br>
Sometime later...<br>
She has gracefully sorted out my disorganized paperwork. Already, my working efficiency has shot through the roof.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Appointing her as my secretary was a brilliant move on my part.)<br>
(Having said that, there is such a thing as working TOO hard. She needs a break.)<br>
Alsace, I think it's time you took a break.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alsace：</span><br>
Pardon? One is operating in maximum secretary proficiency mode. One has no need for breaks.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
You finished your morning work in a flash. I'd like you to pace yourself so you don't burn yourself out.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alsace：</span><br>
Understood. C-Commander, um... should I interpret that as praise?<br>
While I love to hear praise from you, I'm afraid... m-my emotion module can't... handle it...!<br>
<br>
All of a sudden, the temperature in the office starts to skyrocket.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Whoa, whoa! Take it easy!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alsace：</span><br>
S-sorry! I need to disable my vision and perception modules...<br>
<br>
She hangs her head and falls silent. At the same time, the office starts to cool down.<br>
A while later, she raises her head again, her tone of voice indicating that she's regained her composure.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alsace：</span><br>
Forgive this one for losing one's composure.<br>
As atonement, one shall fetch you a cold can of soda at once!<br>
<br>
She rises to her feet and swiftly leaves my office, returning just a short while later with a can of soda in hand.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Thanks.<br>
<br>
As I accept the can from her, I get the feeling that someone is staring daggers through me.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(That's weird... Is it her looking at me, from behind that mask?)<br>
<br>
Spurred on by that strange hunch, I turn my gaze to her – and unknowingly stare daggers through HER this time.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alsace：</span><br>
Y-you've been looking at me for 16 seconds... 17...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
You okay?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alsace：</span><br>
Oh no, oh no... This distance and intensity, it's... It's too much for meee!<br>

Emotional Overload<br>
<br>
3 Alsace, Are You Cool After All?<br>
Here I am, picking up the documents that got scattered all throughout my office. How did that happen, you ask? Alsace overheated.<br>
Speaking of which, it seems the overheating was quite shocking to her – she's sitting on her chair, cradling her legs like a child who's been naughty.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alsace：</span><br>
One is sorry, Commander...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
It's no big deal. Honestly.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alsace：</span><br>
This happened despite all one's efforts, practicing day after day, simulating what it's like to be with you...<br>
One imagined everything, from everyday scenarios to edge cases...<br>
And even... your hands on my... Oh gosh, no, I'm ticklish there...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Not going to ask for particulars – I can guess...)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alsace：</span><br>
All that is to say... One couldn't control oneself, and for that, one asks for forgiveness.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I understand. Your emotion module is unstable. I assume this is a fairly recent thing.<br>
Regardless, I don't have any problems with it. In fact, I think it's one of your strong points.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alsace：</span><br>
Really? A strong point?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Really. Think of it this way – if you easily lose control of your emotions, that means you're sensitive to your surroundings.<br>
I think that's a side-effect of you becoming better attuned to the battlefield.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alsace：</span><br>
Oh... Is that how you see this one?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I know you still think it's an issue. I'll help you come up with a solution.<br>
(That emotion module is the main culprit. That being the case, I just need to teach her how to control it.)<br>
(The question is – how?)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alsace：</span><br>
Y-you mean you'll help me? I'm o-one hundred percent ready for you!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Absolutely. So, learning to control your emotion module is synonymous with learning to control your emotions, period.<br>
And, controlling your emotions is a matter of mindset. With the right mindset, you should be able to keep yourself in check.<br>
Take earlier this morning, for example. You were pretty cool and detached then. What if you adopted THAT state of mind?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alsace：</span><br>
So... you're suggesting that I emulate my earlier self?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Exactly. Give it a try.<br>
<br>
She takes a deep breath, rises to her feet, then walks up to me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alsace：</span><br>
Initiating deep analysis algorithm of analysis module. Examining data logs.<br>
Synchronizing status logs to overwrite emotion module data...<br>
Complete. One may now function as your most r-reliable secretary.<br>
<br>
Her tone of voice and expression alike harbor that spotless composure she had earlier...<br>
However, I can see a tremble running through her, like she's fighting for her life to hold something back.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：(Give her some words of encouragement.)</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Hold steady! I believe in you!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alsace：</span><br>
N-no, I can't do it! I'm going to explode!<br>

Emotional Overload<br>
<br>
4 High-Impact Training<br>
She was already struggling to hold back her emotions, and my encouragement was the straw that broke the camel's back.<br>
She erupted in an explosive fashion, and I was caught in the blast, but we were both alright. After tidying up the office, I bring her outside to get some fresh air.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alsace：</span><br>
......<br>
<br>
Nevertheless, she hangs her head again – and is clearly restless and fidgety.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alsace：</span><br>
It is blatantly clear that one is unfit to serve as your protector...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Don't say that. Things might have gone differently if I hadn't said anything.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alsace：</span><br>
Probability of that: nigh-zero. This is ultimately the fault of one's own unreadiness.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Is it, though? I think you were just particularly receptive since we were alone.<br>
In fact, that might be why you've been losing control more often lately.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alsace：</span><br>
Perhaps...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Try focusing on something else. Take in the outside and breathe in the air.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alsace：</span><br>
Okay! One will not let your thoughtfulness be wasted. Huff... Puff... Huff...<br>
<br>
Taking my advance, she breathes in and out deeply. She does so awkwardly yet adorably. It seems like it successfully calmed her down.<br>
That's when, out of the blue, a little bird lands on her shoulder.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alsace：</span><br>
Oh. What a friendly little thing. One has never been this close to a critter before...<br>
It seems not the least afraid of this one. Interesting.<br>
<br>
Looking at the bird brings a smile to her face.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Why not pet it?<br>
New experiences like this might lead to gaining better control of your emotion module.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alsace：</span><br>
Sure!<br>
<br>
Raising her arm, she scratches the little bird on its back. The stiff, tense look on her face eases up somewhat.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Good. She's loosened up quite a bit.)<br>
<br>
Feeling more relaxed now, she and I walk down the road as we relish the fresh air.<br>
As we're chatting about some silly things, we spot a familiar figure in the distance.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fleuret：</span><br>
Oh! Alsace and the Commander! What're you doing out at this hour?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Just relaxing. My work got done ahead of schedule thanks to her.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fleuret：</span><br>
Ahh, I see. Glad to know she's running on normal mode.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alsace：</span><br>
Indeed. One is operating at peak efficiency as the Commander's protector!<br>
Whatever orders you may have, one will execute them perfectly!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fleuret：</span><br>
I always knew you'd do okay! Also, I've gotta run – I need to help Eepy with a thing! See you!<br>
<br>
We see Fleuret off as she leaves. Even after she's left, Alsace remains full of pep.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(It's been a while now, and she talked with Fleuret like normal, so... let's give this another try.)<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：(Pat her on the shoulder.)</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：(Pat her on the head.)</span>'''''<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''I gently tap on her shoulder as a way of saying, "good job."<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''(Wait, no, her emotion module has finally calmed down... Better not to push my luck here.)<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Instead, I simply gently tap on her shoulder as a way of encouragement.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
You're doing great. We even managed to go on a walk together.<br>
It's okay if you can't fully control your emotion module yet. You're still plenty reliable and an outstanding secretary.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alsace：</span><br>
Ohh... I-I...<br>
I just about managed to hold my feelings back earlier, when you complimented me in front of Fleuret...<br>
B-b-but then you patted me on the shoulder, and even complimented me for being so reliable...<br>
It's... My emotion module c-can't take it...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Alsace? Hang in there! Let's get you back to my office!<br>
<br>
The air temperature begins to rise once again. I give her my shoulder to lean on as I hurriedly head for my office.<br>

Emotional Overload<br>
<br>
5 (Frozen) Liquid Cooling<br>
As soon as I get Alsace back to the office, I lie her down on the couch.<br>
She is breathing laboriously, so I take off her mask, revealing her teary eyes looking straight at me.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Should I not have taken it off?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alsace：</span><br>
*pant*... It doesn't matter... I-I can't deflect your brainwaves, with or without the mask...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
What?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alsace：</span><br>
Um... The outdoors did manage to divert my attention. I was somehow able to hold out until I reached the critical point...<br>
Now, I just need to cool down!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I set the AC to its lowest setting. I'll go get you some ice.<br>
<br>
When I open the freezer, however, I find that I've already used up all my spare ice cubes.<br>
Fortunately, there is no shortage of popsicles.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(I'll just bring all of these to her and order more later.)<br>
<br>
She accepts the popsicles, promptly rips one out of its packaging, and puts it in her mouth.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alsace：</span><br>
Whew...<br>
<br>
After scarfing it down in a heartbeat, she breathes a satisfied moan.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
That reminds me – you had a popsicle in the pool to cool down the other day too, didn't you?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alsace：</span><br>
I did, yes.<br>
Unfortunately, the pool is closed for maintenance today, so I can't go there...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
No worries. There's plenty of popsicles left if you need them.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alsace：</span><br>
That is true! Eating these in front of the air conditioner should have a similar effect, at any rate.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Really? Let's hope so.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alsace：</span><br>
In fact, one is feeling much better already. Thank you for being so considerate, Commander!<br>
Having now recovered from that meltdown, one's maximum endurance has increased!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I wouldn't be surprised if all that sugar also helped you get back on your feet.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alsace：</span><br>
Possibly... The link between popsicles and the happiness and relaxation one feels presently warrants further investigation.<br>
<br>
As she finishes speaking, so too does she finish eating her current popsicle.<br>
Seeing this, I grab another popsicle without a moment's delay, tear open the wrapper, and hold it out to her.<br>
She happily leans forward to take a big bite while I'm still holding it.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Uh... Aren't you going to hold it yourself?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alsace：</span><br>
Huh?<br>
<br>
Surprised, she lifts her head. Our gazes meet, and only then does the situation sink in. Her eyes open wide.<br>
With a stumped look, her eyes switch between my face and the popsicle in my hands.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alsace：</span><br>
I-I was just fed... by hand... b-by you...<br>
Oh gosh... I... I'm losing control again!<br>

<br>
6 Desensitization Sensation<br>
Once again, Alsace had an emotion overload. By the time I finally get her to calm down, rather than return to normal, she becomes depressed.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alsace：</span><br>
*sigh*...<br>
Sorry... As it stands, it is impossible for one to become a proper, perfect secretary...<br>
At least one managed to be productive in the morning, otherwise one would have been an even greater burden...<br>
<br>
Seeing her so full of dejection makes me stop and think about all the times her emotions went out of control.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Come to think of it, it always happened after I made eye contact with her or laid a hand on her.)<br>
(Which means I'm part of the issue.)<br>
Hey, can we talk?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alsace：</span><br>
Huh? Wh-what is it? One is ready for orders.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I just have a question. I want you to answer it honestly.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alsace：</span><br>
Th-th-this is rather sudden!<br>
<br>
Caught off guard by this, she looks away from me and hangs her head in order to prevent yet another overload.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Take it easy. It's not a big question or anything like that.<br>
All I'm wondering is this – your emotion module is suddenly so prone to overloads solely because of me, isn't it?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alsace：</span><br>
Err... Well, um...<br>
<br>
She fidgets and cuts herself off. It's clear she's both embarrassed and reluctant to answer my question.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alsace：</span><br>
Y-yes... It's because one cannot resist the brainwaves you emit.<br>
As soon as one detects those brainwaves, one's emotion module just goes... poof.<br>
However! One HAS gained better control of one's module after all your help today!<br>
Thanks to you, one could now likely endure the overload for at least a few seconds!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
That may be true, but this still calls for more efficient and precise training.<br>
Since I'm the root cause of the problem, let's start by getting you used to basic physical touch.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alsace：</span><br>
Basic... physical touch?! Th-that's setting the bar way too high!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
That's the point. It's called desensitization therapy – repeat exposure to stimuli until you eventually become numb to it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alsace：</span><br>
So... once one becomes numb, one won't suffer any more overloads?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Bingo. Let's begin with a handshake.<br>
<br>
With a nod, she extends a trembling hand. First our fingers touch, then our palms, and finally, the handshake is complete.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Great job. Now let go.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alsace：</span><br>
*pant*... *pant*... Wait, what?<br>
<br>
After a moment of confusion, she does as instructed and lets go.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
How'd it feel?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alsace：</span><br>
*pant*... *pant*... N-not too bad.<br>
<br>
Although she's blushing from ear to ear, I can tell that she's doing her absolute best. That alone is commendable.<br>
We repeat the motion several times – hold hands, let go, hold hands, let go – until she becomes accustomed to it.<br>
Up next – gently feeling her shoulders.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alsace：</span><br>
Oh gosh...<br>
<br>
Though she squirms at first, she builds up tolerance as expected after a few tries.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Good. We can probably keep going like this.)<br>
Getting used to it yet? Alright, then I'm going to pet your head next.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alsace：</span><br>
Head? W-w-well, okay! Um... Go ahead...<br>
<br>
She closes her eyes tightly and fidgets some more. It's infectious and makes me feel nervous as well.<br>
I extend my hand, and just as I'm about to place it on her head...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Brennus：</span><br>
Greetings, Swordbearer. I've brought the documents you asked fo–<br>
<br>
The only half-shut office door is opened fully. I turn around and see Brennus, frozen in place with a puzzled look.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Brennus：</span><br>
Ahem... Are you rehearsing some sort of play?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Rehearsing? Uhh...<br>
<br>
My "rehearsal" partner, meanwhile, is as red as an apple, her eyes still closed and waiting for me to make a move.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alsace：</span><br>
C-Commander, one is ready for you!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Brennus：</span><br>
...I'll leave these here and be on my way.<br>
<br>
Brennus shoots me an interesting look while she puts the stack of papers on the nearest desk, then leaves quietly and closes the door behind her.<br>

7 A Last Resort<br>
After moving on from the spectacular misunderstanding caused by Brennus' sudden appearance, Alsace and I continued our training.<br>
As evening turned to dusk, she wanted to verify how much resistance her emotion module had built up.<br>
I agreed to help, and we performed a simple test together.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alsace：</span><br>
Mmh... Okay! Analysis: one's emotion module has gained an additional five minutes worth of resistance!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(All things considered, five minutes is a pretty big achievement. Although... at the rate we're going, this will take forever.)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alsace：</span><br>
Commander? Why are you furrowing your brow? Oh no... You've determined that one is useless, haven't you?<br>
*sigh*... Sorry, Commander...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
No, not at all. You've been doing great.<br>
I'M the reason why you lose control of your emotions. If anything, I should be saying sorry.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alsace：</span><br>
N-n-no you shouldn't! It's not your fault!<br>
It's my fault for... for falling deeper and deeper in love with you!<br>
<br>
A deep blush covers her face again, but this time, she doesn't suffer an overload.<br>
Biting her lip, she balls her hands into fists and gathers up her courage...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alsace：</span><br>
Yes... I'm in love with you.<br>
Every little thing you do draws my gaze and gives me butterflies in my stomach...<br>
Also, what little resistance I have to your brainwaves has been dwindling further and further...<br>
So it's not your fault. It's mine – for being so in love with you.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Wait... can you control your feelings right now?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alsace：</span><br>
Oh, yes! There's something I've been keeping from you this whole time... I have a last resort to deal with my overloads.<br>
But, I can't execute it without your help, so...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I'll help in any way I can. Tell me how.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alsace：</span><br>
V-v-very well... Executing last resort.<br>
I shouldn't bottle up all this heat inside me... I need to blow off some steam instead...<br>
Overload venting mode... ready.<br>
<br>
She removes her gauntlets and carelessly throws them onto the table.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alsace：</span><br>
Commander... Make me overload so I can take all the pent-up heat and release it at once...<br>
Preparation for physical connection... complete.<br>
<br>
Her cheeks are flushed and a burning heat rises from her hot body.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alsace：</span><br>
This is not just to vent my emotion module, but also to vent my love for you...<br>
<br>
Locking the office door, she looks over her shoulder at me. There is no hesitation or shame in her eyes anymore.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Alsace：</span><br>
Come... help me release my uncontainable love...<br>
