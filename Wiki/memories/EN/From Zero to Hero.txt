<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Hey! Commander.<br>
There's something this port is sorely lacking. Do you know what?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
"Sorely lacking"?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Yeah! It lacks modernity. We're lagging behind the times!<br>
Humanity has invented virtual reality, artificial intelligence, big data...<br>
But you won't find any of those anywhere around this port!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
We have at least one of those. Remember TB?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Okay, lemme correct myself: Those inventions are nowhere to be seen EXCEPT in your office!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
You mean the problem is there isn't enough of it?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Uh... Yeah! That's what I meant!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
In that case, I suppose you have a point.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
I knew you'd agree, which is why I assembled a group of like-minded people before even bringing this up!<br>
Together, we worked overtime to create THIS. Have a look!<br>
<br>
The upbeat Fu Shun trembles slightly with excitement as she places a thick stack of papers on my desk.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
"The Port Virtual Reality Project," eh...<br>
The planning committee consists of... You, Ayanami, Ikazuchi, Inazuma, Long Island, Friedrich Carl, Pamiat' Merkuria, Bristol, Royal Fortune...<br>
Wow, it goes on to the next page.<br>
Clemenceau, Valiant, Prinz Eugen, Marco Polo, Casablanca, Hai Tien, Leonardo da Vinci, Ingraham, Yuubari...<br>
Akashi, and... TB? Even she's involved with this?<br>
<br>
They have a real all-star crew, but I instinctively feel like there's a catch to this.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Okay, and where are you–<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
So anyway! Akashi has already agreed to finance the whole project!<br>
All you gotta do is put your stamp of approval riiight here!<br>
You don't have any reason NOT to approve it! It won't cost you a dime!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Wait... You said Akashi is going to finance ALL of it?<br>
<br>
This combination of words is simply so beyond my expectations that my neurons short circuit.<br>
Fu Shun is really keen on this, and it won't cost me anything...<br>
To hell with it. I'll approve the project.<br>
Two weeks later...<br>
A giant machine stood like a metal sentinel in the academy plaza.<br>
Many others like it – hundreds, even – had been installed all around the port, forming a massive network.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
Nyahaha...<br>
I've waited so long for this day, nya.<br>
I spent an eye-watering sum to make this a reality, nya...<br>
No longer will our tabletop games be played with props, nya! We've upgraded to a virtual reality adventure, nya!<br>
I just need to seize control of this platform and this'll become a money printer, nya!<br>
Nyahahahaha!<br>
<br>
The green little cat laughed with immense joy thinking about all the money she would soon be raking in...<br>
But more importantly, the first party to experience the VR adventure had gathered.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Let me say it for the record one last time! My job is the hero, and you two are my clerics!<br>
Got it memorized? 'Cause I don't wanna hear any confusion about our jobs later on!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Liverpool：</span><br>
Yeah, I've got it! I like being a cleric anyway. The outfit's really cute!<br>
Although... Do we really need TWO clerics? Isn't that redundant?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Not really? I used my dev privileges to give us all sets of powerful gear. You just gotta keep me healed while I dish out the damage!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Unicorn：</span><br>
Okay. I'll do my best to keep you at full health!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
That's what I like to hear! I'll be counting on you out there!<br>
Hey! Akashi! Ms. Smirking Cat! Are we good to go, or do we still have to wait?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
Nyahahaha... Oh! Yeah, the system's up and running, nya! Go ahead, nya!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Alright, final check. Are you ready to set off to a world of fantasy?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Liverpool：</span><br>
Just a sec! Let's see... Makeup's good, clothes are good, phone camera's good... Yeah! I'm ready!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Unicorn：</span><br>
Umm... Is it just going to be us three?<br>
Shouldn't we talk to the Commander before we set off?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
And ruin the surprise? Why would we wanna do that?<br>
I've already seen the Commander's schedule and made arrangements accordingly. In secret, of course.<br>
I'll spare you the details, just know this – the Commander WILL be there! Or else my name isn't Queen of Adventure!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Unicorn：</span><br>
Okay... Then I'm ready, too!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Great! Heheh... I've waited to say this for so long.<br>
<br>
With a swift motion, the girl pointed her finger at the sky and opened her mouth to proudly exclaim the slogan she had come up with.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Onward – to adventure!<br>
<br>
The party set forth on their journey...<br>
At the same time, I suddenly found myself in a simple stone hall. In the distance, there is a celestial globe, glowing with a curious light.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
What the hell...?<br>
I was just in the conference room, hearing a report from Carl...<br>
Now all of a sudden, I'm here. Is this some secret place nobody ever told me about?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
Hail, adventurer from afar, nya. Welcome to Manjuu Temple, nya.<br>
<br>
I turn around and see a throne on the other end of the hall. Akashi is sitting on it.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
...Akashi? What the hell is going on?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
Akashi? You're mistaken, nya! I'm the goddess of luck and riches, nya!<br>
Nyahaha. You must be very confused, nya.<br>
As I said, this is Manjuu Temple, the home of the goddesses that bridge countless realms, nya.<br>
Every now and then, these goddesses pick a lucky dead person to get sent to another world to live out a new life, nya.<br>
And this goddess chose you, nya. That's all you need to know, nya!<br>
It really is a shame that you died so young, nya...<br>
But don't fret, nya! I'm going to give you a shot at a new life, nya!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>

'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Everyone back at the port still needs me!<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Send me back! I have too much work to die!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''N-nya?! Nyanyanya?!<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Sheesh... You've had a really rough life, nya...<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''At least you're already in character, nya...<br>

'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Hang on... Is this that port VR project Fu Shun told me about a couple of weeks back?<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''I remember Carl was on the planning committee, and I was about to talk to her before I got transported here.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''I bet she was in on this!<br>

'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''We just want to show you the fruits of the project now that it's done, nya.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''So I was right. You have created a VR game of unprecedented scale.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Though, given the roster of talent you had, I suppose I shouldn't be surprised.<br>

'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''At least let me see what it's like before you tell me to invest...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Heheh. Sounds like I've already got you on the hook, nya.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
Here, take this – it's your character build card, nya.<br>
You'll need it on your adventure, nya. Get out there and enjoy yourself, nya!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Wait, my build is predetermined?<br>
I thought I'd get to pick where I reincarnate and what broken skills I get. Isn't that usually how these things go?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
...That's a pretty good idea, nya!<br>
We'll think about adding that later as DLC, nya!<br>
Now... Brave reborn adventurer, I pray that your journey in this new world shall be most exciting, nya.<br>

<br>
After a bright flash, the shipgirls found themselves in a town, all equipped with fantasy gear.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Liverpool：</span><br>
Blimey... This place both looks and smells completely different from the port.<br>
And look at that! I'm wearing a cleric's outfit now!<br>
This virtual reality thing is brilliant!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Unicorn：</span><br>
I can even feel the mana inside my staff...<br>
It feels like I've become a real cleric able to use magic.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Hang on, this isn't right!<br>
Where's my new outfit? I've got my hero's sword, but I still look the dang same!<br>
Did she not implement the dozens of different hero's outfits I worked day and night to design?! Ugh!<br>
Goddess of order and rules, this is an emergency! I summon thee!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB ：</span><br>
Your consumable emergency contact item has now been used.<br>
Reply: There was no final verdict on the implementation of the hero's outfit, and I was not authorized to decide on my own.<br>
Therefore, your default outfit assets were utilized to ensure a stable game experience.<br>
This concludes my answer. Terminating call.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Crap... She's right. I was so focused on making a cool sword that I never decided on the outfit...<br>
Talk about embarrassing... but at least my sword is here in all its glorious detail!<br>
Whoa... The grip has a great feel to it. I really nailed every aspect of this thing!<br>
Anyhoo, let's open our adventure interfaces and check out our gear and stats.<br>
Huh? Unicorn, why is your job "apprentice" cleric?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Unicorn：</span><br>
Well... The job description says, "Clerics are powerful mages who began studying holy magic. They can inherit some spells they learned from their previous job."<br>
I chose to inherit summoning magic so I could go on this adventure with Yuni.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Wait, apprentice clerics can inherit spells from other jobs?!<br>
That's such a good idea! I can't believe I didn't come up with that!<br>
And if Yuni is a mount, we can even travel by air! We're coming out of the gate swinging on this adventure!<br>
Next up: Quests... Ah, there it is!<br>
The first one is to travel to the Endless Woods and search for a party commander.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Liverpool：</span><br>
A party commander, eh? Sounds like we'll be looking for my Master.<br>
That's kind of funny. Still a commander even in a fantasy world.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
I know, right? We cast a vote and decided to keep it that way.<br>
But, if I could've had it my way... hehehe... I would've made the Commander a berserker!<br>
The joy of unga-bungaing your way to victory! I wish the Commander could've gotten to experience that!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Unicorn：</span><br>
But berserkers lose their minds and go on rampages... I'd hate to see big brother like that...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Yeeeah... Most people didn't like the idea. Oh well.<br>
Anyway, enough dragging our feet! Adventure awaits us! Let's go do the main quest!<br>
To the Endless Woods we go!<br>

<br>
Once the blinding light recedes, a vast and lush forest unfolds before me.<br>
I walk and wave my arms to see how it feels. I can move freely, just as though I were in the real world.<br>
I touch the bark of a nearby tree. It feels faintly damp and cold under my fingers.<br>
Birds sing overhead, and the plants and the ground under my feet smell just like the real deal.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Wow. All my senses give the impression that this is real.<br>
It doesn't get much more immersive than this. It really feels like I've gone to another world.<br>
Akashi's funding and TB's computing power make for an incredible duo.<br>
Ah, I'm getting ahead of myself. There's something important I need to check!<br>
<br>
......<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：The logout button!</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：If I can feel pain or not!</span>'''''<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''I fumble around until I bring out the adventure interface.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''At the bottom of the menu, there's a button with just two words in all-caps: "END ADVENTURE."<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''So I can leave if I so want. Good to know!<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''If this place is able to perfectly simulate touch, smell, hearing, and so on, then simulating pain should be child's play.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''With my heart beating a touch quickly, I turn to a tree and punch it with all my strength.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Hiyah!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''I could feel not just the tree, but also the impact – yet hardly any pain.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''It's like my sense of pain is dulled. I assume that was done for safety reasons.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''They really thought of everything, even quality of life things like that.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
With that out of the way, it's time to check my build.<br>
Let's see... What stats do I have this time around?<br>
...Job: Commander. Level 1.<br>
...Guardian Deity: Goddess of Luck and Riches. Akashi, in other words.<br>
...Base stats: 100 HP, 50 MP, 11 ATK, 9 DEF, 12 SPD, 750 LCK.<br>
...Wait, did I read that right?<br>
<br>
I rub my eyes and look again. Yes, I did read that right.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
My luck stat... is 750?<br>
That's more than all my other stats combined four times over...<br>
Let's see, skills, skills... There. Looks like I've got 6 starting skills.<br>
Throwing: C, Sprinting: B, Battlefield Command: SSS, Info Recording: SSS, Info Analysis: SSS...<br>
Doesn't sound like they have anything to do with charming or enamoring people this time.<br>
I think I get the picture.<br>
My character is a frail but exceedingly lucky and gifted battlefield commander.<br>
Which is to say... I won't live long on my own. I need a party of teammates I can rely on.<br>
<br>
Just then, I hear a loud drumming noise coming from inside the forest.<br>
At the same time, a blurb of information appears on my adventure interface.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Adventure Interface：</span><br>
"The Endless Woods are inhabited by an endless herd of Slimejuus."<br>
"That drumming sound came from one of their patrols, commanded by a King Slimejuu."<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Aha, so this thing automatically gives me data on the enemy. That must be one of my Info skills doing their work.<br>
This is a pretty good thing to have.<br>
But it's useless for actually dealing with the enemy. I should...<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Use my Throwing skill to fight them!</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：Use my Sprinting skill to run away!</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''This has to be some sort of tutorial level. The enemies can't be THAT strong.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Besides, everyone knows a good adventure needs fisticuffs. I'll take 'em on!<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''While I don't have any weapons, there are heaps of sticks and stones lying around.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Time to break some bones!<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''I pick up the largest rock I can find and throw it with all my might at the King Slimejuu in the distance.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Hiyah!<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''It put a small dent in the King Slimejuu's health bar!<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''But then, it swells up with fury and starts making a beeline straight for me!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''I have no real combat skills, and my base stats are pathetic. I should avoid combat altogether when possible.<br>

<br>

'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''No, what am I saying? This isn't a game of dice rolls. Being lucky or not has nothing to do with it!<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''The King Slimejuu in the distance, now aware of me, starts coming toward me at full speed.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Crap...<br>
Why is that thing so strong?! It has no right being in a beginner area!<br>
I guess this is it. My adventure is over before it could even start...<br>
<br>
SHWING!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Hey! Vile monster! Leave that one alone and face the hero!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Unicorn：</span><br>
Big brother! We're gonna save you!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Liverpool：</span><br>
Master, get inside my magic circle! It'll protect you!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
A party! Led by Fu Shun, too! You girls came not a moment too soon!<br>
<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
This is it for you!<br>
Taste the sharpness of my hero's sword!<br>
<br>
SHWING!<br>
Dadadada-daadaa-dadadaaa♪<br>
An upbeat victory song starts to play as the King Slimejuu disintegrates into little balls of light.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Victoryyy! We are SO good! Best party ever!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Unicorn：</span><br>
Phew. That monster was really strong for our first encounter...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Liverpool：</span><br>
Seriously! I think someone wants you dead, Master!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
It wouldn't surprise me. Still, we won, despite the odds being against us.<br>
You three are still only level one, just like me, right?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Yuppers. Adventurers at our level can't even dream of beating monsters like that King Slimejuu.<br>
Not ordinarily, anyway! We won this battle 'cause of the bonus item I got for my part in the project!<br>
THIS! The sword wielded by the legendary hero!<br>
The power within it lets me make quick work of any monster the likes of a King Slimejuu!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Ohh, I get it. It's comically overpowered.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
I prefer the term "dev-exclusive weapon"!<br>
That aside, something is strange here... Our quest was just to find you, but we haven't gotten a new one yet.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Maybe the quest is a work in progress?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Uh-oh. It might be...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Liverpool：</span><br>
Shouldn't you know what's up, Fu Shun? You WORKED on the game.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Well... no. I went out of my way to avoid spoilers.<br>
I mean, what's the fun in knowing everything that's gonna happen? You'd just be going through the motions, and that's lame!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
That's a good point. The game wouldn't feel very fresh.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
See? The Commander gets it!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I think we should follow adventure game custom and go gather info at the nearest village. Who's with me?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Aha! Already immersed in your role, I see!<br>
I second that idea. You ARE the commander of our party, after all!<br>
Having said that, the party's name stays the same! It's still Fu Shun the Hero's Party!<br>

{{折叠面板|标题=An Irregular Tutorial Village|选项=4|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<br>
This village got its name from the word Ursprung – meaning "origin."<br>
Adventurers are likely to visit it as it's the first village you see after exiting the Endless Woods and following the road.<br>
As far as names go, this one is pretty fitting.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bristol：</span><br>
Welcome to Ursp! Mah name's Bristol, I'm the mayor 'round here.<br>
You folks must be dead tired after all that walkin'. Now, ordinarily, I'd set ye young'uns up with a feast...<br>
But, our resources are stretched too thin right now because of the Demon King Аrmy. They've been attackin' more and more each day.<br>
Then there's been the Royal Army's rounds of conscription, too...<br>
We're short not just on materials, but manpower, too. There's hardly any young'uns left in the village. It's mostly old folks like mahself.<br>
*sigh*... I really hope this war will end soon.<br>
Oh, but look at me, talkin' the day away. You adventurers oughta keep followin' the road to the Royal Capital and speak to the king.<br>
If ya get the king's permission, ya can start on yer quest to slay the Demon King!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
......<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
......<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bristol：</span><br>
What're ya standin' around for? Shouldn't ya get movin'?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
You don't have any side quests?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Yeah. Like looking for lost items, or defending the fields against monsters, or cleaning somebody's house.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Liverpool：</span><br>
Surely there's SOMETHING we can do?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bristol：</span><br>
Ahem... 'fraid not. I don't know anythin' 'bout no side quests.<br>
(Psst. Listen. There's nothing in this village. No side quests, no hidden items, nada. You should just be on your way.)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
What? Are you telling us to get out?!<br>
You're talking to the hero's party! Show some respect!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bristol：</span><br>
You know, there used to be many parties like yours. I once saw over a dozen in a single day.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Oh yeah? Behold! I have the legendary hero's sword! This proves that I, Fu Shun, am the strongest of all heroes in the kingdom!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bristol：</span><br>
Yes, yes, I'm sure. I also once saw over a hundred heroes flauntin' their "legendary swords" in the span of a week.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
You've got some nerve, painting me as a rando! I'm gonna put your NPC butt in its place!<br>
...What? Why can't I attack her?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bristol：</span><br>
Heheh. Ya see, I'm an important NPC and mah job is to guide new adventurers. As such, I've got the blessin' of the goddess of order and rules – the game system's blessin'.<br>
Besides, this isn't a game where ya can kill NPCs freely and break all yer quests!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Grrr... Bristol, you little twerp...<br>
Fine! We'll go to the Royal Capital!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bristol：</span><br>
I wish ye luck, brave adventurers.<br>
Oh, and if ya do manage to slay the Demon King, be sure to come back here!<br>
I promise I'll treat ya to a real feast!<br>

{{折叠面板|标题=The Castle and the King|选项=5|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<br>
This is the Royal Capital, the heart of the kingdom of humanity.<br>
A great wall of stone rises toward the sky, encircling the city and inspiring awe.<br>
Passing through the gates, we reach a big plaza. The bustling cheering of people on the street speaks to the prosperity of this place.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Unicorn：</span><br>
Wooow. That's a big castle.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Liverpool：</span><br>
That building looks beautiful... Oh, and that one, too...<br>
Ugghh! I wish I could take a selfie with my Master so badly!<br>
I had my phone before we set off and everything! But I guess those aren't allowed in VR!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Don't freak out! Check your adventure interface! There should be a screenshot feature there.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Liverpool：</span><br>
Oh, you're right, there is! Thanks!<br>
Oh yeah! Look who's in a fantasy city! Master, gimme a smile!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Unicorn：</span><br>
Big brother... There's a big temple to the northwest.<br>
I'm an apprentice cleric, so I might learn a new skill if we go there.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Liverpool：</span><br>
That reminds me! I'm also a cleric, so I should be able to learn the same skills as you.<br>
Let's go check out the temple right now!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Hold your horses! First of all, we should stop by the marketplace.<br>
Or what? Do you NOT want to get new gear?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(There's a temple, a marketplace, an artisan district, an adventurer's guild...)<br>
(Even exploring just this city is going to take a while.)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
I don't hear any objections, so let's go to the marketplace and... Huh?<br>
What's this?! I can't move through this alley!<br>
<br>
Fu Shun tried to take the path to the marketplace, but was stopped by an invisible wall at the intersection.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
"This area will unlock after you advance the main quest"?<br>
I thought this was an open world! Why the heck won't they let me through?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Friedrich Carl：</span><br>
Heehee, is this your first time here?<br>
That's a barrier set up by the Holy Church and the Church of Steel. It's a security measure to prevent first-timers from trespassing.<br>
To get past it, you'll have to visit the designated area in the city and sign up.<br>
Oh, where are my manners? I'm Friedrich Carl, a mechanic from the Church of Steel.<br>
Seeing as you're adventurers, you should visit the Adventurer's Guild or the castle first. Shall I guide you?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I suppose we have business at the castle. Show the way.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Friedrich Carl：</span><br>
Of course. This way, little one!<br>
<br>
Royal Castle - Audience Hall<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">King George V：</span><br>
A hero, a commander, and two clerics...<br>
What an interesting party you have.<br>
I hear your plea, adventurers.<br>
Your drive and readiness to defeat the Demon King are worthy of respect.<br>
On behalf of the kingdom of humanity, I thank you all.<br>
I shall provide you with some funds to help you accomplish your quest.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Liverpool：</span><br>
Your Majesty, can I have a word?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">King George V：</span><br>
Yes? You may speak your mind, pious cleric.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Liverpool：</span><br>
We haven't seen an inkling of the Demon King yet... How will we know when we've beaten them?<br>
Do you have, like, a picture? A photo?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">King George V：</span><br>
Excellent question, cleric.<br>
Indeed, you cannot defeat a foe that you know nothing about.<br>
Alas, the Demon King is protected by a special spell that renders her unidentifiable by regular means.<br>
That is, until just a few days ago, when one of my royal mages managed to briefly break this spell and lay eyes on her.<br>
Guard, show them.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hero：</span><br>
You got it, King♪<br>
Alright, have a gander. This is a royal spell – the culmination of the castle's knowledge. It's called... Instant Capture.<br>
Show us your mug, Demon King!<br>
<br>
At the center of the hall, a dark purple sphere of magic rises into the air.<br>
Inside it, you can just make out a girl with the horns and tail of a demon.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
That's her... That's the Demon King.<br>
(I should use my Info Analysis skill. Any info we can gain on her abilities will be useful when it's time to fight her.)<br>
<br>
Silently, I activate my skill.<br>
But... not a single thing appears on my adventure interface.<br>
All that happens is that the sphere of magic begins to shake violently. It seems moments away from collapsing.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">King George V：</span><br>
What?! The Instant Capture spell is becoming unstable! How did this happen?!<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">Devonshire：</span><br>
Heheheh...<br>
Mwahahahahaha!<br>
Someone is watching me. I can feel it.<br>
Who is it? You? You? Or perhaps... you?<br>
<br>
The girl in the sphere comes to life and moves. A sort of pressure that's difficult to describe fills the hall.<br>
A pressure like... the Demon King was actually here in person.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">Devonshire：</span><br>
Foolish worms. You lack even basic manners.<br>
I shall teach you a lesson about not spying on people.<br>
Light of Destruction, I call–<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">King George V：</span><br>
Damn it! Guards! Prepare a defensive spell!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Unicorn：</span><br>
Big brother! Look out!<br>
<br>
The burning hot light is so powerful that I can feel it on my skin, even behind a protective barrier.<br>
Eventually, the light disappears from the hall, as does the Demon King and the sphere.<br>
...Along with the entirety of the hall itself.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Thank god nobody was hurt. Looks like the guards kept the king safe from harm, too.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Unicorn：</span><br>
Um, I think the king is furious with you now...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Liverpool：</span><br>
What did you do? Did you use your Info Analysis skill? Crap, that's not good...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
VERY not good! Some might even say terrible!<br>
But we DID complete the quest and get our rewards, so...<br>
Quick! Let's get the hell outta here!<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">King George V：</span><br>
Guards! Throw these mad adventurers in jail!<br>
Guards! Guaaards!<br>

<br>
Sometime later, in the Royal Capital streets...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Phew... THAT was close. They almost threw us in jail!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Liverpool：</span><br>
How come nobody's chasing after us? They looked livid back in the castle.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Might be because we moved to a new map! NPCs can't do that!<br>
Good thing we got our reward from the king before we bailed. 500 gold was extremely generous of her!<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：I wonder if this was an early access mission.</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：No more risking our lives for a measly 10 copper coins!</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''If it was, then I hope they keep it in the final release!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Damn straight! We're set now!<br>
<br>
Thanks to the king's hefty reward, we were in a position to splurge all we wanted.<br>
Fu Shun bought a suit of armor from the blacksmith. Unicorn enhanced her staff to its max level.<br>
Liverpool purchased a new outfit. While it's not the best in terms of stats, it IS the cutest you'll find in the whole city.<br>
Then there's me... Sadly, the commander job can't equip most weapons and armor sets.<br>
So instead, I spent the remainder of our funds on alchemy bombs.<br>
Throwing is my only combat skill, so pairing it with bombs makes the most sense.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Hey, gang! You'll wanna hear this!<br>
I just heard a juicy rumor over at the Adventurer's Guild!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Unicorn：</span><br>
What did they say?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
That a legendary mage who once defeated the Demon King lives somewhere in the Endless Woods!<br>
Think about it. Our party consists of me, the Commander, and you two clerics. We desperately need some offensive magic!<br>
If we can recruit this mage, it'll round out our party!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Liverpool：</span><br>
A mage out in the woods, eh... Let's do it!<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Who is she? A thousand-year-old elf?</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：Aren't the deep woods pretty dangerous?</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''No idea. We'll just have to see for ourselves!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''It'll be fine! Sure, it's more dangerous than the outskirts, but the monsters are no tougher than that King Slimejuu.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
There's the notification! Quest: Recruit the Legendary Mage!<br>
Destination: Deep inside the Endless Woods!<br>
Let's set off, folks!<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=Mage of the Endless Woods|选项=7|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<br>
The deeper into the forest we go, the more winding the path becomes. The woods are like a maze.<br>
Fortunately, my skills save the day. They identify the correct path to take at every fork in the road.<br>
Cutting through a grove, we come upon a clearing amongst the trees.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
Zzzzz... Mmh...<br>
Zzzzzzzz...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Liverpool：</span><br>
Hey, uh, someone's sleeping on the ground.<br>
And she's got a staff with bunny ears on it... Isn't that the legendary mage?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Could be. What do you all think?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Unicorn：</span><br>
I'm sensing a huge amount of mana coming from her.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Meanwhile, my Info Analysis skill says her offensive magic ability is through the roof.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Interesting... Then we've found our mage.<br>
But why is she sleeping on the ground, defenseless? I dunno if someone so careless is of any use to us.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
Detecting mana fluctuation...<br>
...Hm? Who are you people?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
She knows we're here. Might as well go talk to her.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
...Okay, so you want me to join your party.<br>
Thanks, but no thanks.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Liverpool：</span><br>
Huh?! But we're on our way to take down the Demon King!<br>
Haven't you already done that before? Why don't you wanna help?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
If you kill the Demon King, another one will just take her place eventually.<br>
I'm tired of it all. I don't wanna fight.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
See? I told you she wouldn't be of any use.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Something feels odd about this.)<br>
(Oh, my Info Analysis skill is picking up something. Almost like it's telling me to use it right now...)<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：(Use Info Analysis on Laffey.)</span>'''''<br>
<br>
I activate my skill, and a flood of information about the mage fills my interface.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Adventure Interface：</span><br>
"Laffey the Mage - Race: Planet Bunnyian"<br>
"A member of the legendary hero's party that is said to have slayed the Demon King a thousand years ago."<br>
"Status: Cursed"<br>
"Status Name: Curse of Sloth"<br>
"A curse left by the Demon King. It locks the target in a cycle of endlessly repeating the past in their mind until their sanity is engulfed by negativity."<br>
"Dispelling Method: Unknown."<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
We'll have to lift the curse on her before we can recruit her.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
She's been cursed? All this time?<br>
A thousand years ago she beat the Demon King, and that curse still haunts her...<br>
I can't imagine what it's like to suffer for a whole millennium.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Liverpool：</span><br>
I'm more amazed by the fact she hasn't gone insane after so long!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Unicorn：</span><br>
I think we should find a way to lift the curse.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Of course, but that's not going to be easy. First of all, we must gather more info.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Hang on a minute, there's a plate next to her! I think someone has been regularly coming by to leave food for her.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Liverpool：</span><br>
You're right! Maybe that person knows something!<br>
<br>
That's not all. In addition to the plate of food, there is also a handful of medicinal potions lying around.<br>
Those were made by a potion maker who lives in a nearby village.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Hey, aren't you that mechanic we met in the Royal Capital?<br>
What are you doing here? Are you stalking the Commander or something?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Friedrich Carl：</span><br>
Ahaha, sorry for appearing out of the blue. I'm not a stalker, I assure you.<br>
I saw you were headed for the Endless Woods. Its deepest parts are dangerous, as you now know.<br>
I was worried you'd get hurt, so I followed you just in case.<br>
About that curse... The Church has also been trying to lift it, but to no real success.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
So talking to that potion maker is our best bet, then.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Friedrich Carl：</span><br>
Mhm. I know for a fact she made all of the ones lying around here.<br>
She's been looking after the great mage for who knows how long.<br>
It seems she's been trying to lift the curse in the only way she knows how.<br>
Sadly, she hasn't made any more progress than we have.<br>
Although, the other day, she did say her next potion was bound to finally work.<br>
Personally, I've given up on the great mage, but I think you all should pay the potion maker a visit.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
You said she lives in a nearby village, right? Sounds like a lead worth pursuing.<br>
Commander, let's go find her!<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=The Village Potion Maker|选项=8|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<br>
Thermalq Village – its name is derived from the word Thermalquelle, meaning "hot spring."<br>
It lies at the edge of the Endless Woods and is bathed in warm steam all year round.<br>
Just moments after we enter the village, we find a massive cauldron sitting in the town square – and next to it, a quest-relevant NPC.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nubian：</span><br>
Mandrake root and beak of crow♪<br>
Heat up well, add giant's toe♪<br>
Stir the pot, make mana grow♪<br>
When it's done, the brew may blow♪<br>
It boosts your stats, makes you cool, you know♪<br>
So, who'll be the first to taste it?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Liverpool：</span><br>
Looks like we've found our potion maker.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Unicorn：</span><br>
Big brother... I'm scared...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Take it easy. Potion makers are just weird like that.<br>
This one's orthodox as well, judging by her speech and technique.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
An orthodox potion maker, huh? Let's hear what she has to tell us.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nubian：</span><br>
You've... You've come to help break the curse on the great mage?!<br>
Oh, that's wonderful... I thought everyone had forgotten about her after all these eons...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Hey, uh, you're crying.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nubian：</span><br>
Forgive me... I was just so moved I couldn't hold the tears back.<br>
For the longest time, I've tried everything to break that curse.<br>
And after all that, I've not made any progress to speak of...<br>
Ah, I'd nearly forgotten! I made this potion just a minute ago.<br>
You there, the commander. Won't you test it for me? I think it's going to work this time!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
What? "Test" what?<br>
I'm not cursed, so it won't work on me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nubian：</span><br>
No, no, it's not for breaking curses. This potion should imbue you with vigor.<br>
The inspiration for it hit me just the other day.<br>
Besides, I am but a potion maker. Neutralising a curse is beyond my abilities.<br>
The curse on the great mage affects her heart, dampening her spirit. So I got an idea – why not cancel it out with a potion to cheer her up?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Ohh! Beating the curse at its own game! That's a good idea!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Unicorn：</span><br>
...It's worth a shot, big brother. Try the potion!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Liverpool：</span><br>
Yeah. What's the worst that could happen, right?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Are you serious?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Unicorn：</span><br>
You'll be fine. If the potion has any side effects, I'll cast a spell to bring you back to normal.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Liverpool：</span><br>
Exactly! And if purifying magic doesn't work, I know healing spells that definitely will. You've got nothing to worry about!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
You heard them! What harm is a little potion gonna do when you have two clerics by your side?<br>
Go on! Drink it!<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Bottoms up!</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：This is peer pressure, but fine! I'll drink it!</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项3：I want the damn option to say no!</span>'''''<br>
<br>
Bracing myself for the worst, I take the potion from Nubian and chug it all.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Adventure Interface：</span><br>
"Notification: You have obtained the skill Poison Resistance. Rank: B."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nubian：</span><br>
Whoa... It gave you a new skill. I really am a genius potion maker!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Are you? "Poison resistance" doesn't sound like what you had in mind.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nubian：</span><br>
That is true... Another failure, it seems.<br>
I'm out of options! I have to move on to the last solution!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
And what's that?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nubian：</span><br>
To go to the northern tower on Silverbank Island and ask for help from my master – the wise Arkhangelsk!<br>
She is a famous witch who has been around since the age of mythology AND she's the favourite disciple of the ancient goddess of wisdom!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Whoa! You're the disciple of a disciple of that goddess!<br>
You should've said you had such a cool backstory!<br>
There's no time to waste! Let's go see your master right now!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nubian：</span><br>
Well... it's not quite that easy.<br>
She has locked herself in that tower and won't speak to anyone but me.<br>
Also, if I leave the village, there'll be no one left to care for the sick.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Liverpool：</span><br>
Ahh... Yeah, they probably wouldn't like it if we took you away like that.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
That's it? Pfft! There's an easy fix!<br>
The villagers don't strictly need you to be around, they just need the cures for their ailments.<br>
All you gotta do is create enough all-purpose healing potions for them and they won't mind if you leave the village for a while.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nubian：</span><br>
Oh yeah, that would work! You're a genius!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Heehee. I'm just a seasoned adventurer, that's all.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nubian：</span><br>
There's still one problem, though...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Here we go...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nubian：</span><br>
As I just said, I can't leave the village for long.<br>
I'll need ingredients to make all those potions. Could you get them for me?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Urgh...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Liverpool：</span><br>
Oh.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Unicorn：</span><br>
Ahh...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I knew it. There's no escaping the fetch quests.<br>

<br>
To the west of the Royal Capital, in the Looking-Glass Lake, lies Silverbank Island.<br>
We finally got the potion maker to accompany us there... after painstakingly gathering the ingredients to make 99 potions.<br>
After sailing a small boat across the lake, we laid anchor and at last set foot on the island.<br>
The place looks barren, seemingly only home to a dense forest and craggy rocks.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
So... where is the northern tower? There's no silver anywhere on this island, just a bunch of trees and bushes.<br>
Are you sure we didn't end up on the wrong island?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nubian：</span><br>
I'm sure. This is the right place.<br>
You can't see the tower because my master has hidden it using magic.<br>
She's the kind of lady who likes silence and privacy, you see.<br>
And yes, the island's name may seem deceptive. My master said that this used to be a vast ice lake, long ago. Perhaps that's where the name came from.<br>
Anyway, let's move! Watch my back!<br>
<br>
With a smug expression, Nubian walks up to a clearing. She bows to a dead tree and then clears her throat.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nubian：</span><br>
My master, the wise witch! It's me, Nubian! I've come to visit!<br>
<br>
Then, the space ahead of us seems to warp and bend...<br>
Out of thin air, a tall tower made of black metal manifests.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
It's glowing red... H-hang on, isn't this one of the Demon King's bases?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nubian：</span><br>
My teacher just likes black and red. Relax, it's got nothing to do with the Demon King!<br>
Follow me. I'll show you inside.<br>
<br>
We reach the highest floor of the tower. The legendary witch sits in a chair at the center of a magic circle.<br>
<span style="color:#fef15e;">Arkhangelsk：</span><br>
I know why you're here. Leave.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
But we haven't said anything yet!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nubian：</span><br>
Don't be dumb. She knows EVERYTHING. She's the witch of wisdom, if you forgot.<br>
Master, why won't you help us? We're talking about the great mage who defeated the Demon King a millennium ago.<br>
I believe we should lift the curse on her!<br>
<span style="color:#fef15e;">Arkhangelsk：</span><br>
*sigh*... You've always been so naive.<br>
Here's what's going to happen. There is only one person amongst you who can be of use to me.<br>
That is you, Commander. I shall teach you how to break the curse if you stay here and become my disciple.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Hmm... Studying under an extremely wise witch doesn't sound so bad.<br>
<span style="color:#fef15e;">Arkhangelsk：</span><br>
Right? You can learn so much about magic and so much more. I can even show you the secrets of the world.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nubian：</span><br>
Wait, Commander! Do you realise what becoming her disciple means?<br>
You'll be confined to this tower for ages!<br>
Only after a hundred years will you be allowed to leave, and that's if you pass her beginner's test!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
A... A hundred years?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Come on, you're exaggerating... right?<br>
<span style="color:#fef15e;">Arkhangelsk：</span><br>
She's not. Training under my watch is done in increments of a hundred years. Don't you know that?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Unicorn：</span><br>
No... Big brother can't leave us for that long!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Yeah! We have a Demon King to defeat!<br>
<span style="color:#fef15e;">Arkhangelsk：</span><br>
Uh-huh. I suppose forcing you won't work. I'll give you a chance to prove your worth instead.<br>
I shall teach you how to lift the curse... if you can complete my trial.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Liverpool：</span><br>
A trial from the wise witch, eh. I'm guessing... a pop quiz?<br>
<span style="color:#fef15e;">Arkhangelsk：</span><br>
That's what I'd usually do, yes.<br>
However, your Commander possesses a godlike Info Analysis skill. It would make even my hardest quiz trivial.<br>
So, instead, I will have you partake in a combat trial.<br>
Are you ready? Then let's begin!<br>
<br>
<br>
KABOOOM!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
It's over for you!<br>
Herooo Slaaash!<br>
<span style="color:#fef15e;">Arkhangelsk：</span><br>
Heheh. That was fantastic. You pass.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Heck yeah! I mean... Of course! Didn't even break a sweat!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Liverpool：</span><br>
Phew... We did it. That was so much work, keeping everyone healed.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Unicorn：</span><br>
Yeah... Thank goodness we could neutralise all those curses.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Interesting. Those weren't monsters she sicced on us, they were Sirens...)<br>
(She even cast advanced curses on us during the battle.)<br>
Hey, what was up with all those curses and monsters you used?<br>
<span style="color:#fef15e;">Arkhangelsk：</span><br>
What about them? I am the all-knowing witch. Of course I can cast advanced curses and control monsters from beyond this world.<br>
Do you want to learn how? Then you should reconsider becoming my disciple.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nubian：</span><br>
Master, please give that a rest already!<br>
<span style="color:#fef15e;">Arkhangelsk：</span><br>
Poor Nubian. You've turned soft for people ever since you left the tower.<br>
Regardless, a promise is a promise. You passed my trial, so I'll now show you how to lift that curse.<br>
<br>
Arkhangelsk holds her hand in the air and an elegant flute appears in her palm.<br>
<span style="color:#fef15e;">Arkhangelsk：</span><br>
This is the Flute of Time. A keepsake from the legendary party that great mage was in.<br>
Play this to her and the curse will be lifted.<br>
But after that, you... Never mind, it's not important.<br>
Take the flute and resume your quest, heroes.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Yippee! We got a key item!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Arkhangelsk was about to say something, but stopped herself. Something tells me it WAS important.)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Don't just stand there, Commander. It's time to leave!<br>
Let's go back to the Endless Woods and lift that stupid curse!<br>

<br>
Deep in the Endless Woods - Great Mage's Napping Place<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
Zzz... Mmgh... Zzzzz...<br>
Zzzzz...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nubian：</span><br>
She's fallen asleep again.<br>
Given how long she's been cursed, she's probably having a nightmare right now...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Not for long! I'm gonna break your curse, Laffey!<br>
<br>
The Flute of Time plays a beautiful sound, causing a dark matter to evaporate from Laffey's body.<br>
The strands of matter combine in the air and swell like a balloon. Then the mass explodes, blanketing the clearing instantly.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
I THINK that lifted the curse, but what's happening now?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Unicorn：</span><br>
...Big brother! Something bad is coming!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Liverpool：</span><br>
I'll put up a barrier just to be safe!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nubian：</span><br>
Dammit! The power of the curse is manifesting itself as several monsters!<br>
Be on your guard! We're about to face things that have literally lived for a thousand years!<br>
<br>
One by one, the dark presence materializes into human-looking monsters. Moments later, we are deeply surrounded.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
What the heck?! These monsters are suppressing my sword's power!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Liverpool：</span><br>
Maybe it's not as strong or legendary as you thought...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Unicorn：</span><br>
I think Bristol was right. She said she'd seen over a hundred like it in a week.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
That can't be true! Even if it is, I don't wanna hear it now!<br>
I need a hero's pluck now more than ever!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
You know, it's not very herolike to doubt yourself and cower before a battle.<br>
A true hero faces even the mightiest of enemies with courage!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ayanami：</span><br>
Yes. You have nothing to be afraid of, heroes of the new era. We will help you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
Thank you for lifting the curse on Laffey. Let's deal with these monsters together!<br>
<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
*yawn*... I cast the ultimate explosion spell – Explosion.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ayanami：</span><br>
Ultimate Ability: Dynamic Kick!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
300% charged! I use Mountain-Splitting Cleave!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
Hero's blade, show your true power! Endless Slash!<br>
<br>
With the help of the legendary party, the battle was over in a flash.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Sheesh! I knew you were strong, but THIS strong?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ayanami：</span><br>
That we are, yes. Keep the praise coming.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Liverpool：</span><br>
Hey, uh, aren't you kind of... fading away?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
Fading away?<br>
Ah, you mean this. We're merely phantoms from the past, brought back temporarily by the Flute of Time.<br>
Soon, we'll be gone altogether since we've used up all our strength.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nubian：</span><br>
Huh? But Laffey is fading away, too!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
Mhm, that's because she's also a phantom.<br>
Planet Bunnyians don't live for thousands of years.<br>
She's only stuck around for so long because of the Demon King's curse, I think.<br>
Now that her curse has been lifted, she's gonna go to heaven with the rest of us.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
I can't wait to have sweet dreams again.<br>
Thank you, all of you, for lifting the curse.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nubian：</span><br>
But... But you're finally free of the curse, and now you're just... *sob*...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(This must be what Arkhangelsk didn't tell us. She knew this was going to happen.)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
Don't cry. I'll give you something as thanks for all you've done...<br>
There. I fully refilled the Flute of Time's mana.<br>
If you're ever in a tight spot, use the flute again to summon us.<br>
This isn't our last meeting. Promise.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nubian：</span><br>
Okay...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
Oh, new hero! One thing before I go.<br>
It was pretty weird how the monsters suppressed your sword's power. Do you know why?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Because my "hero's" sword is fake?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
Yup! It's just an imitation. THIS is the real hero's sword!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Are you serious?! That sword just looks like a big fish!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
It sure does!<br>
I'll bet people born after us all thought it looked way too goofy to be a legendary weapon.<br>
That's probably why they made imitations of it look more... normal, like yours.<br>
Oh, but your sword is still a good sword, even if it's not legendary.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
But it's only a fake... It's no hero's sword...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
Don't think of it like that!<br>
It's not the sword that makes the hero, it's the hero that makes the sword!<br>
Yours will become the new hero's sword if you slay the Demon King with it!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
You're right... Yeah, you're totally right!<br>
Thank you, legendary hero Javelin!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
Heehee! Glad I could help!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ayanami：</span><br>
Farewell, new heroes. We will meet again.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Liverpool：</span><br>
Hey, wait! Let me at least get a picture! Smile for the camera!<br>
Perfect! Okay, see you later, legendary heroes!<br>
<br>
A gust of wind sends the legendary party back to the heavens. The forest returns to silence.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
What a wild turn of events...<br>
Our plan to recruit the great mage has failed spectacularly.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Liverpool：</span><br>
At least we got a legendary item for our troubles.<br>
That flute is sure to keep us safe on our journey!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
I guess so.<br>
This was a pretty emotional quest...<br>
But it was also our only lead. What do we do now?<br>
<br>
KABOOOM!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Liverpool：</span><br>
Hm? Hey! I hear fighting coming from the south!<br>
Sounds like it's a clash of armies!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nubian：</span><br>
Oh no... Is the Demon King Army attacking?!<br>
That can't be! The great wall should keep them out!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Unicorn：</span><br>
Let's go see what's happening!<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=They Came From the Sky|选项=11|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<br>
A violent battle unfolds on the road toward Sentinel Bastion.<br>
CHIIIRP!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jeanne d'Arc：</span><br>
Out of the way!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Téméraire：</span><br>
Your Holiness, look out!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">L'Opiniâtre：</span><br>
Freezing Chains, bind them!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jeanne d'Arc：</span><br>
Thank you for the assistance!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">L'Opiniâtre：</span><br>
Your Holiness, we are lightly armed and our foes are many. We will not last in a protracted battle!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jeanne d'Arc：</span><br>
I'm aware. Still, we cannot abandon these villagers.<br>
I shall draw the monsters' attention. You two protect the villagers and retreat!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Téméraire：</span><br>
No! You can't, Your Holiness!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jeanne d'Arc：</span><br>
It is the only way. Please do as I say!<br>
<br>
Meanwhile, across the battlefield...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nubian：</span><br>
Those Dark Slimejuu Knights ordered the attack...<br>
This is bad. The Demon King Army is attacking AND it's their airborne hunters division!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Who's that fighting over there? The Royal Army?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nubian：</span><br>
Yes, that's– Wait, is that the Saint herself?!<br>
What's the Saint doing this far from the Royal Capital?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Unicorn：</span><br>
Big brother, this is serious!<br>
The Royal Army probably won't hold out for long!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Everyone, get ready for battle! We're going to help them!<br>
<br>
<br>
KABOOOM!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jeanne d'Arc：</span><br>
Phew... That was the last one.<br>
Thank you for coming to our aid, adventurers.<br>
We would have suffered major casualties were it not for you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Don't mention it! Helping those in need is just what heroes do!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nubian：</span><br>
Your Holiness, why'd you fight the Demon King Army with such a small force?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jeanne d'Arc：</span><br>
Well... I didn't want to fight any monsters today.<br>
I simply saw these villagers being attacked whilst en route to Sentinel Bastion, and I helped them.<br>
It's very alarming that the Demon King Army is now attacking settlements even this close to the Bastion...<br>
I fear that the situation on the frontlines is getting worse.<br>
Adventurers, may I beseech you something?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Sure! What do you need?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jeanne d'Arc：</span><br>
Our great wall is protected by many goddesses, including the goddess of light and justice. Even the Demon King cannot break through it so easily.<br>
However, her army tore a hole through it during a major battle a few days ago.<br>
I left the Royal Capital specifically to help repair the hole. Alas, I did not anticipate the Demon King Army would attack a settlement so close to it.<br>
I believe the Demon King means to exploit this gap in our defenses to make a move.<br>
So, I want to travel to the Bastion and reinforce it, but I cannot just leave these poor villagers to fend for themselves.<br>
They are all evacuees from Friede, a village that sits close to the hole.<br>
It's safe to assume that monsters are laying waste to their homes as we speak.<br>
Which brings me to my request – would you please clear the village of monsters?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fei Yuen：</span><br>
Adventurers! Please save our village!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Killing monsters and saving a village? Sounds exactly like a quest fit for a hero!<br>
What do you say, Commander?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Of course we'll help you.</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：Only if the reward is right.</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''There you have it! The Commander said so!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fei Yuen：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Uh, of course... We'll give you a heap of rewards if you do it!<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''That is, if you survive...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Alright, the hero's party is on the case!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fei Yuen：</span><br>
Thank you! May the goddess of peace and protection be with you!<br>

{{折叠面板|标题=To Friede Village's Rescue|选项=12|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<br>
Friede Village – it gets its name from the word Frieden, which means "peace."<br>
A rather ironic name since it is now engulfed in the flames of war.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Half the buildings have been burned to the ground...<br>
Weird. There isn't a villager or monster in sight.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">???：</span><br>
Halt! You there! Identify yourselves!<br>
You look like bandits raring to loot the ruins! Not on my watch!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Who are YOU calling a bandit?!<br>
I am the hero, and this is my party! We're on a journey to defeat the Demon King! Now who are you?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vanguard：</span><br>
Ah... Adventurers.<br>
Apologies for suspecting you.<br>
I am Vanguard, knight banneret and guardswoman from the west wall.<br>
I came after receiving word that Friede was under attack.<br>
Don't worry. We've already eliminated every last monster.<br>
That's what you came here to do, I presume.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Yes, and... now you've kind of left us with nothing to do.<br>
No rewards for this side quest, I guess.<br>
You know what that means, Commander. Back to the main quest.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Hang on. This quest isn't finished yet.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Liverpool：</span><br>
Huh? It's not?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Vanguard, you said you're a guardswoman from the west wall.<br>
I've heard that a battle just a while ago tore a hole through it. Is that right?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vanguard：</span><br>
That's strictly confidential information. Who told you that?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Doesn't matter. What I wanted to ask is – was it really a good idea to take your troops and leave the west wall unguarded?<br>
Who's defending the hole now?<br>
If it's nobody, the Demon King Army is probably going to target it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vanguard：</span><br>
Urgh! You've got a good point...<br>
I need to get back to the wall right away!<br>
<br>
KABOOOM!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Liverpool：</span><br>
Sounds like another battle!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nubian：</span><br>
This time it's coming from over by the wall!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vanguard：</span><br>
Son of a...<br>
Soldiers, regroup! Return to the wall immediately!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
We'll back you up!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vanguard：</span><br>
Many thanks!<br>

{{折叠面板|标题=Attack on the Wall|选项=13|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<br>
Swarms of flying monsters hang in the sky like dark clouds. They descend upon the wall with the force of a squall.<br>
Swords and magic and machinery and armor clashed and collided with one another.<br>
By the time we arrive, there is already a heated battle unfolding in the air above the wall.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Malin：</span><br>
They've sent in flying monsters AND an undead battalion... They're going all-out.<br>
This is going to be a fierce battle...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">L'Indomptable：</span><br>
Let them come! We are knights of the Royal Army! We shall not falter!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Algérie：</span><br>
Hold the line! Let not a single monster through!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vanguard：</span><br>
Behold the light of my royal sabre!<br>
Hey! Sorry I'm late!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">L'Indomptable：</span><br>
What a superb attack!<br>
You came not a moment too soon, Vanguard.<br>
Had you taken any longer, there would've been no monsters left for you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Malin：</span><br>
So... How's the village?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vanguard：</span><br>
We cleared it of monsters. All the villagers got out safely.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Malin：</span><br>
That's great news.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vanguard：</span><br>
Still, I was careless to fall for the Demon King's diversion. I should've known better.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Algérie：</span><br>
Known better and done what, exactly?<br>
The wall's entire raison d'etre is to protect our people against the Demon King Army.<br>
Coming to their aid is nothing to be ashamed of. Leaving them to fend for themselves – that would be.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vanguard：</span><br>
Yes... You're right.<br>
At any rate, that problem has been dealt with. Now it's time to deal with this one.<br>
Tell me, what are we up against?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Algérie：</span><br>
Their army is attacking on all fronts. It makes our battle a few days ago look like a tavern fight.<br>
Their forces are led by a general of their army – Dragonlord Blücher.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vanguard：</span><br>
The Dragonlord? Heh, I like a challenge.<br>
Heed my words, knight of darkness. You will suffer the pain that you've inflicted upon our people twofold!<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">Blücher：</span><br>
Mwahahahaha☆<br>
Buuurn! Turn to ashes!<br>
Ahah! Their positions are in tatters! Milord has proved once again what a brilliant strategist she is!<br>
Crushing these humans is gonna be child's–<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Hey! You! Are you the Dragonlord?<br>
That title is bigger than you are!<br>
I know what you're doing! You're trying to hide how small your force actually is!<br>
I'm gonna knock you off that dragon and bring you down to earth!<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">Blücher：</span><br>
Oh? An adventurer?<br>
Mwaha☆ They're so desperate, they're relying on adventurers to defend their wall now!<br>
Hmph! Since you clearly don't understand the disadvantage you're at, I'll show you!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Unicorn：</span><br>
Did you hear that? Blücher took the bait!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Liverpool：</span><br>
Hah! This is gonna be such an easy win!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Indeed. Even the strongest army will lose if its general is compromised.<br>
Now we wait for our chance to shoot her down.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Roger! I've been waiting for an excuse to draw my sword!<br>
<br>
<br>
KABOOOM!<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">Blücher：</span><br>
Ugh! Seriously?!<br>
Don't assume you've won already!<br>
Revenge WILL be mine!<br>
I'll be back, and then– Whoa, whooooaaaa! Mind the turbulence, dragooooon!<br>
<br>
Blücher is dragged along helplessly by her dragon. The two disappear like shooting stars among the distant dark clouds.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Dang. The dragon's scales were too thick and it got away.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jeanne d'Arc：</span><br>
Perhaps so, but this is still a major victory for us.<br>
With their general out of the picture, it's only a matter of time before their rank and file collapses.<br>
And to think you did this by provoking her, then taking her out with flawless teamwork...<br>
You truly are an exceptional strategist, Commander.<br>
One day, you and your party may just defeat the Demon King and restore peace to the world.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：We will, and that's a promise!</span>'''''<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Friedrich Carl：</span><br>
O goddess of steel and dragons, unleash thy fury upon our foes!<br>

What the... The Holy Church and the Church of Steel are here!<br>

Everyone! Hold firm in your belief of victory!<br>
Reinforcements have arrived! Let us smite these monsters together!<br>

<br>
After the battle ended, we were formally invited to partake in the victory celebration at Sentinel Bastion.<br>
This place serves as the center of operations for the wall's defenders. Yet, once upon a time, it was no more than an unremarkable little village.<br>
That changed when the Demon King Army assaulted the walls of the old castle, decimating it.<br>
Following its destruction, the heads of the last royal family of the old dynasty beseeched the goddesses for help. With their aid, this great wall was built, dividing the land in two.<br>
It was thanks to this wall that the kingdom of humanity survived, narrowly escaping ruination at the hands of the Demon King Army.<br>
Then, the Royal Capital was rebuilt, and the kingdom managed to prosper once more.<br>
Little by little, this place – the beating heart of the great wall – became a second capital, growing into what is now known as Sentinel Bastion.<br>
This brings us to today, where the streets are littered with colorful decor and the people cheer loudly.<br>
To celebrate humanity's victory in an important battle.<br>
Sentinel Bastion - Banquet Hall<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">L'Opiniâtre：</span><br>
Incredible. You actually managed to lift the curse on the great mage...<br>
And not only that, you even spoke to the old heroes! I almost can't believe it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
You should! I haven't even told you the most shocking detail yet...<br>
You know the legendary hero's sword? All this time, it was actually shaped like a fish!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Téméraire：</span><br>
Shaped like a fish? Come on, nobody's gonna believe that! You're just making it up!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Am not! You think I would lie about something so lame?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Liverpool：</span><br>
Alright, settle down. Whether it's the truth or not doesn't really matter.<br>
Now lookie here and pose for the camera!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Malin：</span><br>
Bleh... What the heck is this jiggly stuff?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Liverpool：</span><br>
It's my favourite and speciality – eel jelly! I think it's the perfect for a victory banquet.<br>
Though, full disclosure: I couldn't find any eels, so I used Eel Slimejuu meat instead. It's pretty similar in texture!<br>
Come on, don't be shy. Try it!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">L'Indomptable：</span><br>
Slimejuu meat? Are you serious? You just stuffed a monster into your food!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Malin：</span><br>
Th-thanks, kind adventurer, but I'm not hungry. I'll have to pass on this one.<br>
I'm sure your cooking would be lovely after a drink or–<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nubian：</span><br>
Did somebody say drink? I've got just the thing for you!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Malin：</span><br>
...Huh?<br>
Excuse me, what's this? It's pitch black, yet it's somehow glowing...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nubian：</span><br>
It's a very special drink, made by yours truly.<br>
Drinking it will make all your fatigue from fighting go away, just like that!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Malin：</span><br>
I somehow don't believe that! Besides, a knight like me doesn't tire after one mere day of combat!<br>
I appreciate the thought, but please find someone else to give your drink.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nubian：</span><br>
Come ooon, I made it just for the banquet! At least have a small sip! Please?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Malin：</span><br>
NO! I will NOT drink it!<br>
<br>
A fun and friendly atmosphere hangs in the banquet air.<br>
Prim and proper knights mingle and chat with laid-back adventurers, all having a good time.<br>
And then there's me and the thought in the back of my mind that prevents me from really enjoying myself.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
That general of the undead army dropped this golden coin after we defeated her...<br>
My Info Analysis skill says this coin was produced back in the age of the old kingdom.<br>
Why did a general of the Demon King Army have a coin like this?<br>
It almost makes me think the old kingdom, the undead army, and even the Demon King are all somehow connected...<br>
But in what way, I have no idea. Too little to work with.<br>
This lore stuff is pretty fascinating. Really tickles your imagination.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Liverpool：</span><br>
Masteeer!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nubian：</span><br>
Commandeeer!<br>
<br>
It seems if I can't find fun at the banquet, the fun will find me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Liverpool：</span><br>
*sob*... Nobody wants to eat the food I made!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nubian：</span><br>
*sob*... And nobody wants to drink my special potion either!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Liverpool：</span><br>
Please, pleeease eat it!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nubian：</span><br>
Please, pleeease drink it!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(I DO have an SSS-rank Curse Resistance. My gut should be able to handle this.)<br>
Of course, uh...<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：I'll eat your food, Liverpool.</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：I'll drink your potion, Nubian.</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项3：I'll have them both!</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Urgh... What happened?<br>
I must've passed out...<br>
<br>
I feel something warm and soft against my head.<br>
Something smells nice, too...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Unicorn：</span><br>
Oh... You're awake.<br>
I scolded Liverpool and Nubian for what they did.<br>
It's like as soon as I'm not here, they start feeding you weird stuff...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Did you look after me while I was out cold? Thanks for that.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Unicorn：</span><br>
Heehee... How do you feel now?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Fine. I'm right as rain.<br>
Turns out that Poison Resistance really came in clutch.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jeanne d'Arc：</span><br>
You won't kill the Demon King anytime soon if you're getting knocked out even at a party.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Yeah. Imagine if I died not in a battle, but at a banquet attended by healers, angels, and clerics...<br>
I'd be a laughing stock for the rest of time.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jeanne d'Arc：</span><br>
I sense subtle mockery in your words...<br>
At any rate, it's good that you're safe. I have something important to discuss, so I'll go and gather your party members.<br>
<br>
Sometime later, in Sentinel Bastion's assembly room...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jeanne d'Arc：</span><br>
...In light of these achievements, Her Majesty has decided not to hold you accountable for the destruction of her audience hall.<br>
Additionally, your party shall be granted permits to freely pass through Sentinel Bastion.<br>
Naturally, you will need equipment and supplies to brave the Wasteland. The Royal Army shall provide you with those.<br>
Later, you may also visit our armory and pick any weapons you'd like.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Wait, what was that about permits?<br>
Do you need a PERMIT to go off and kill the Demon King?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jeanne d'Arc：</span><br>
Of course you do.<br>
The Wasteland is dangerous, and our kingdom needs every warrior it can get. We cannot simply let people wander toward pointless deaths.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Oh... Good thing we decided to help defend the wall.<br>
Our journey to slay the Demon King would've been over without those permits.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jeanne d'Arc：</span><br>
You would also have been seized by the guards and brought back to the castle to answer for your crimes.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Ahahahaha...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jeanne d'Arc：</span><br>
Ahem... On behalf of Her Majesty, I would like to thank you all for your bravery in that battle.<br>
Furthermore, I, personally, have a special reward to give you, Commander. For your outstanding contributions.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
A special reward? What is it?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jeanne d'Arc：</span><br>
Joffre, go ahead.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Joffre：</span><br>
Yes, ma'am.<br>
Commander, given your numerous successes already, it has been determined that you have the latent ability to lead the party that shall slay the Demon King.<br>
In the name of the goddess of light and justice, I hereby grant you the Blessing of Light.<br>
I hope that it will help you on your way to the Demon King.<br>
<br>
Joffre the Fighting Angel offers a prayer, and a golden light illuminates the surroundings.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Adventure Interface：</span><br>
"Notification: You have obtained the skill Blessing of Light. Rank: SSS."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jeanne d'Arc：</span><br>
Now you carry the blessing with you.<br>
Thus, the ceremony has concluded, and my work for the night is done.<br>
You may return to the banquet hall and enjoy the rest of your evening.<br>
I hope you have a pleasant time.<br>
<br>
Sentinel Bastion - Guest Room<br>
It's late in the night, and a woman stands alone in a pitch-black room.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Friedrich Carl：</span><br>
She awarded that blessing...<br>
That's mean of you, Saint. Stealing the honor like that.<br>
But while the Blessing of Light protects your mind, it won't be enough for the party to defeat the Demon King.<br>
Doing that will require my Blessing of Steel, which protects the flesh.<br>
...Oh, seems my spell didn't completely put you to sleep, little one.<br>
Heehee, though it doesn't look like you'll be fully waking up soon either.<br>
Until then, I want you to take my love.<br>
You should feel stronger once you wake up.<br>
And this – just think of it like a sweet dream on your quest to kill the Demon King.<br>
Nighty night, my dear little one.<br>

<br>
Following the battle, our party stayed at Sentinel Bastion for three days to rest and recover.<br>
We upgraded our gear and stocked up on supplies, then read up on the Demon King Army as much as we could.<br>
Then, finally, we passed through the main gates, officially taking our first step into the monster-occupied Wasteland.<br>
We followed the established road leading away from Sentinel Bastion, but it wasn't long before it abruptly stopped.<br>
We kept going in the same direction and eventually ended up in a thick forest stuffy with fog.<br>
The trees all around us look twisted and mad, their desiccated branches reaching for the sky like broken arms.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Unicorn：</span><br>
Big brother, this place is creepy...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I think we've entered what my skills call the Withered Woods.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jeanne d'Arc：</span><br>
Correct. These are the Withered Woods.<br>
<br>
A figure appears from the mist – it's Jeanne d'Arc, the saint of the Holy Church.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：What are you doing here?</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：Welcome to our party!</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jeanne d'Arc：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''I've been waiting for you.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''I wish to join you. I believe my assistance will bring about the Demon King's defeat just a bit sooner.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''That is, if you'll let me. Will you?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Of course. Welcome to the team.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jeanne d'Arc：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Heehee. Thank you. You won't regret this.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jeanne d'Arc：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Ah, so you've already deduced why I'm here.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Indeed, I've been waiting for you here so I could join you on your quest.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''I believe that coming with you should bring about the Demon King's defeat sooner, even if only slightly.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jeanne d'Arc：</span><br>
As I was about to say... This is the Wasteland, dubbed so for obvious reasons.<br>
This dramatic change is the result of a curse that was placed on it. A spell simply known as the Demon King's Curse.<br>
Long ago, before even the great wall was built, these woods were actually an extension of the Endless Woods.<br>
But now, this place has been reduced to a restricted area, its fauna withering and lava streams raging.<br>
To the best of our knowledge, the Demon King and her army have established three bases on this side of the wall.<br>
These are the fortresses to the west, east, and center of the Wasteland.<br>
The Demon King Army has been applying pressure on our great wall through these bases.<br>
We have embarked on holy expeditions before in attempts to purify the Wasteland... but all were unsuccessful.<br>
Even if you purify one area, there are still the three bases that propagate the curse.<br>
You can bless the purified land to keep it pristine for a while, but once the blessing wears off, the curse will reclaim it.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
So it's not that purification doesn't work, it's that those bases undo its effects.<br>
If we can neutralize the bases, the land won't be ruined again, right? Even without blessing it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jeanne d'Arc：</span><br>
Indeed, but it should be noted that you CAN bless the land, Commander.<br>
You carry the blessing of the goddess of light and justice in your heart. It can purify the land if you just destroy those bases.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
What? The Commander can do that?!<br>
What about ME?<br>
When will it be MY time to shine?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jeanne d'Arc：</span><br>
Umm... I suppose your glorious duty is to slay the monsters and capture the bases.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
...Good point!<br>
You're right! It IS my duty to slay the monsters!<br>
So, what are we waiting for? Let's find a base and clear it out!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nubian：</span><br>
Shhh! Quiet!<br>
My master told me this place is inhabited by ferocious monsters that–<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">Berserker Knight Slimejuu：</span><br>
CHIRP CHIRP CHIRP!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Liverpool：</span><br>
Bugger, they know we're here...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Oh, fiddlesticks!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Change formation! Prepare for battle!<br>
<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">Berserker Knight Slimejuu：</span><br>
CHIIIRP CHIRP!<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">Explosive Slimejuu：</span><br>
CHIRP! CHIRP!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
There are too many of them! Too many even for me to handle!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Unicorn：</span><br>
I'm out of MP...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Liverpool：</span><br>
Yeah, same...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nubian：</span><br>
Take these MP recovery potions! I've got healing potions left, too, so I'll cover you!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jeanne d'Arc：</span><br>
Commander, we will be overwhelmed if this continues!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
The monsters on this side of the wall are something else entirely...<br>
We should avoid head-on confrontations with them until we know their weaknesses.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">???：</span><br>
At least someone among you has a working brain.<br>
That said, if you were truly smart, you never would've come here to begin with.<br>
I've deployed a smokescreen to distract them. Recover now while you can.<br>
What a party you have...<br>
A hero, two clerics, a potion maker, a commander, and...<br>
Well, if it isn't the Royal Army's saint.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jeanne d'Arc：</span><br>
You look familiar... Are you... a vampire hunter?<br>
They say you're a resistance group that fights the Demon King Army from this side of the wall.<br>
I thought the stories about you were just that – stories.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">???：</span><br>
It's better for us if some people believe that.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sheffield：</span><br>
Well met, Your Holiness. I'm Sheffield, a vampire hunter, as you surmised.<br>
I'm curious, what are you doing out here? Did you leave the safety of your castle to go on an adventure?<br>
I took you for a coward, hiding behind that wall whilst sending adventurers to their deaths in the land you abandoned.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jeanne d'Arc：</span><br>
I do not take kindly to insults directed at the soldiers of the Royal Army!<br>
We fight day in and day out to defeat the Demon King!<br>
Furthermore, we support those brave souls who venture into the Wasteland and treat them with the utmost respect!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sheffield：</span><br>
Defeat the Demon King, you say?<br>
Do you know how much time has passed since your last holy expedition?<br>
Has even a single one been carried out since you were born?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jeanne d'Arc：</span><br>
Well... I...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sheffield：</span><br>
Now this is getting interesting. You snuck out without telling anyone, didn't you, Ms. Saint?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Wait, you didn't tell anyone?!<br>
Sooo... we're suspects in helping her escape now...<br>
If the army captures us, they will DEFINITELY throw us in jail this time!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jeanne d'Arc：</span><br>
That...<br>
That won't happen, I assure you. I did this entirely on my own.<br>
Whatever consequences arise from this, I shall bear myself. I will not let them punish you.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I know you won't.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jeanne d'Arc：</span><br>
...You knew that I snuck out, didn't you, Commander? And let me into your party nevertheless?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：We'll need all the manpower we can get.</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：I just thought holding you hostage would be fun.</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jeanne d'Arc：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''That is true. The more people on your side against the Demon King, the better.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Nobody will mind that you snuck out if you and the rest of us defeat the Demon King, either.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jeanne d'Arc：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''I suppose that's– Wait, you thought even that far head?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jeanne d'Arc：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''H-holding me hostage?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Unicorn：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Big brother...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Sorry, sorry. It was just a joke.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sheffield：</span><br>
Heh. Your party sounds like a fun bunch.<br>
Even if you weren't, the vampire hunters welcome anyone who ventures to this side of the wall.<br>
Now, is everyone topped off on health?<br>
Then come with me if you want to live. I'll bring you to a safe place.<br>

<br>
Following Sheffield's lead, we travel to the center of the Withered Woods.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sheffield：</span><br>
The bases that you want to capture are protected by a strong magic barrier known as "the Neverending Night."<br>
It's a closely-guarded vampire spell that makes it impossible to pass through. It must be dispelled first.<br>
It's due to this barrier that we've been unable to capture any base for so long.<br>
Speaking of the bases, the central one is the most well-protected of the three.<br>
The Demon King has focused most of her forces there as well, owing to its proximity to Sentinel Bastion.<br>
It's tragic, thinking of all the adventurers who've perished to it.<br>
It lies so close to the main gate, and yet it's so out of their league...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jeanne d'Arc：</span><br>
Yes... And we got very close to being its latest victims.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sheffield：</span><br>
You're lucky that I ran into you.<br>
Luck is an important thing to have. Sometimes it can even be more important than anything else.<br>
This luck was the potential I saw within your party, and it's why I decided to save you.<br>
...Keep following me. Our base is just up ahead.<br>
<br>
Sheffield looks forward at what looks only to be a pile of desolate ruins.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Your base... is among those ruins?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sheffield：</span><br>
Not quite. Below.<br>
It's well-hidden, so I don't expect you to see where it is.<br>
<br>
I keep scanning the ruins from afar, and eventually, the ruins of a majestic castle wall catch my attention.<br>
While it is crumbled down for the most, some parts of it still stand proudly intact.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Are those the ruins of the old castle wall?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Seydlitz：</span><br>
Yes. People like to call it "the Royal Crown Wall Ruins."<br>
Though it may be far before your time, to us... it's like it was still pristine only yesterday.<br>
Sheffy, I see you've dragged in lost adventurers again.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sheffield：</span><br>
Please stop. I don't want to hear this again.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Seydlitz：</span><br>
Heehee, I know, I know. Come on, adventurers, let's talk inside. We don't want a patrol to catch sight of us.<br>
<br>
We pass through the ruin entrance guarded by a magic spell and enter the vampire hunters' base.<br>
I expected some sort of dank dungeon, but it's actually quite spacious and comfortable down here.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Seydlitz：</span><br>
We've been living here for a long time now. We couldn't just leave this place in a sorry state.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
A long time, eh... I can't hold back my curiosity – just how old are you people?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Seydlitz：</span><br>
How old?<br>
Hah. Either you haven't done your homework, or your kingdom hardly knows anything about us.<br>
We vampire hunters have existed since before the old castle fell.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jeanne d'Arc：</span><br>
Hang on... Didn't it fall several hundred years ago?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Seydlitz：</span><br>
That it did. It's almost hard to believe it's been that long.<br>
The vampires now under the Demon King's command weren't always like that. They were once nobles who resided in the kingdom.<br>
And, in fact, we humans and vampires used to coexist long, long ago.<br>
Then came that horrible day, when the Demon King Army marched in...<br>
Whilst the city deployed most of its army at the front, those opportunistic vampire bastards staged a rebellion.<br>
This rebellion led to the city's downfall. From that day on, Ballad Castle came to be known as the Songless Castle.<br>
Time moved on, and one day it became known on the map only as "the Old Royal Capital Ruins."<br>
We are, in every sense, survivors from that calamity that befell the city.<br>
We were commoners, guards, maids, merchants, artisans... All of us had different social standings before the downfall.<br>
Now, we are all united under the title of vampire hunter.<br>
We made a promise. To keep fighting until the day either we or the vampires have been wiped out.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jeanne d'Arc：</span><br>
My word... I never knew the truth behind the old city.<br>
This part of history was completely lost amidst the chaos of relocating the city.<br>
What's more, I thought it was only the Demon King who brought down the city through brute force...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sheffield：</span><br>
Hah. If she had that kind of power, your great wall wouldn't be able to stop her.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jeanne d'Arc：</span><br>
...So you were once humans like us.<br>
But it's been centuries, and humans don't live that long. How are you still alive?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Seydlitz：</span><br>
You're right, humans don't live for centuries. Not most humans, anyway.<br>
I think that maybe the catastrophe was so horrific that some goddesses took pity on those who survived it.<br>
They gave us their blessings, and that has allowed us to live to this day.<br>
Everyone who isn't here... They met a tragic end.<br>
Those who lost their lives amidst the initial fighting, they were the lucky ones.<br>
Many, many more were turned into undead slaves puppeteered by the vampires after inhaling a cursed mist.<br>
Those traitorous vampires presented their "achievement" to the Demon King and gladly joined her side. Today, they're second-in-command only to the Demon King herself.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Blessings and curses... Interesting.)<br>
(A blessing from the goddesses extended the vampire hunters' lifespans, while Laffey's was extended with a curse.)<br>
(You could even say those who were turned into undeads were given longer lives in a twisted way.)<br>
(If these phenomena are all linked somehow, then what happened to the old capital may be even more complicated than I thought...)<br>
Do you still remember the exact location of the old capital?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Seydlitz：</span><br>
Wait... You're not thinking about exploring the ruins, are you?<br>
Frankly, you should give up while you're ahead.<br>
Those ruins have been the undeads' main base ever since the downfall. Even we can't approach them on a whim.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Sheffield told us about the vampire spell that protects the bases. The Neverending Night.<br>
If we suppose that the old city was the vampires' headquarters and that it fell in a very short span of time...<br>
Then they probably left the key to lifting the spell somewhere among the ruins.<br>
If we find it, we can break the barrier and defeat those vampires that betrayed you so long ago.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sheffield：</span><br>
You make a good point. Knowing my Master's outstanding luck, finding it might just be possible.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Seydlitz：</span><br>
Very well... Then we shall go there.<br>
Not today, though – it's late as it is. Let's rest up, then go treasure-hunting in the ruins tomorrow morning!<br>

<br>
Ballad Castle – it got its name from the endless sound of music that came from it, never drowned out by the streets.<br>
This was once the heart of the kingdom of humanity. Though now it's but a husk of its former self, one can still see a glimpse of its former glory.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sheffield：</span><br>
How I've missed you, Ballad Castle.<br>
Ruined though it may be, this place's structure hasn't changed much since it was spared from the worst of the fighting.<br>
The vampire nobles all used to live in the castle. This road should take us to...<br>
...Strange. I don't see a single undead anywhere.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Seydlitz：</span><br>
Yes, this is supposed to be their nest... Where have they all gone?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Whydah：</span><br>
*yaaawn*... Who do you think you are, setting foot on Tempesta's turf?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Liverpool：</span><br>
Uh... "Tempesta's turf"?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Golden Hind：</span><br>
Well, well! Seems we have ourselves a band of adventurers with a death wish!<br>
Heehee, what brings you here? Hoping to find buried treasure among the ruins, hmm?<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">Mary Celeste：</span><br>
We run this place! You wanna pass through? Then hand over your valuables!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nubian：</span><br>
Ohhh. They're just bandits.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">Mary Celeste：</span><br>
Bandits? Slander! We are decent, hardworking pirates!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Unicorn：</span><br>
Pirates on land? I've never seen that before...<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">Mary Celeste：</span><br>
Well, now you have! We're pirates, AND we're on la– Wait, I'm getting sidetracked again.<br>
Hey, what were we talking about?<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">Whydah：</span><br>
You were saying, "Hand over your valuables."<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">Mary Celeste：</span><br>
Oh, right. Valuables, NOW!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
A gang of lowly pirates, trying to shake down the hero's party? That's rich!<br>
All you're gonna get from us is a lesson in respect!<br>
<br>
<span style="color:#fef15e;">Whydah：</span><br>
No... Little guys, wait.<br>
Look at their commander... Does anyone else recognise that aura?<br>
<span style="color:#fef15e;">Golden Hind：</span><br>
Oh... Is that the Blessing of Light?<br>
<span style="color:#fef15e;">Mary Celeste：</span><br>
The blessing bestowed by the goddess of light and justice... They're allies of the Royal Army!<br>
Hey! Commander! Let's stop fighting!<br>
This is all a big misunderstanding!<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：(Order a cease-fire.)</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
A misunderstanding?<br>
<span style="color:#fef15e;">Whydah：</span><br>
Yeah. You heard her.<br>
It's actually great that you're here. We've been waiting for this day for an eternity.<br>
Anyway, will you pay the rest of our reward?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：I'm sorry, what?</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2："The rest" of it?</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项3：What reward?</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#fef15e;">Whydah：</span><br>
*sigh*... Right, it's been centuries...<br>
Okay, story time. We used to be free pirates who occasionally committed petty crimes.<br>
Every now and then, our crew made landfall to resupply and catch a break from the sea.<br>
Whenever we did, we'd offer ourselves as mercenaries in exchange for a bit of coin.<br>
One day, we'd completed a really high-paying job and went to the city to celebrate.<br>
We were having a meal when, all of a sudden, chaos broke out on the streets.<br>
Then this bigwig royal showed up and was like, "Won't you come to the castle and be my guards?"<br>
I was gonna say, "You think Tempesta is a bunch of sellouts, you dip?" But that sum we were offered was too big to refuse.<br>
But there was a secret catch – that this protection gig would last hundreds of years!<br>
<span style="color:#fef15e;">Mary Celeste：</span><br>
We were here to witness that curse fall upon the city, turning almost everyone into a mindless undead.<br>
The goddess of pioneering and adventure must've rewarded us for our faith, because we were spared that fate. Sort of. We've existed as ghost pirates ever since then.<br>
<span style="color:#fef15e;">Whydah：</span><br>
Being a ghost pirate IS as cool as it sounds, don't get me wrong...<br>
But being stuck in one place for countless generations suuucks! I'm fed up with it! I wish I could quit!<br>
Now, finally... FINALLY our payday has come.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Geesh... That's a pretty sad story.<br>
Even if it sounds like it's waiting for a punchline...<br>
No matter! A hero should embody the spirit of chivalry!<br>
If it's money you want, they gave us a load of it back at Sentinel Bastion!<br>
Here! This should cover everything!<br>
<br>
Fu Shun assumes a cool attitude and produces a bag of gold, dropping it on the floor.<br>
<span style="color:#fef15e;">Whydah：</span><br>
Let's see... What the heck is this? Anyone recognise these?<br>
<span style="color:#fef15e;">Golden Hind：</span><br>
Can't say I do. I've never seen coins like these.<br>
<span style="color:#fef15e;">Mary Celeste：</span><br>
Bastards! You trying to rip us off with counterfeits?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Counterfeits?! This is the real stuff they use in the city!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Ahh. These pirates have been stuck here for so long that they don't know the kingdom's currency has changed.<br>
We'll need coins they're familiar with if we want to pass through here.<br>
Speaking of which... it just so happens I have one.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：(Hand them the antique coin.)</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#fef15e;">Mary Celeste：</span><br>
That's more like it. I knew you had the real deal on you!<br>
One single coin isn't gonna cut it, though!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I know it won't. This is just a sign of goodwill.<br>
I hope it's enough to let us pass. We'll pay you the rest once we've finished our business inside the castle.<br>
<span style="color:#fef15e;">Whydah：</span><br>
...Alright. You have a deal.<br>
Little guys, clear the path and let the adventurers through.<br>

Old City Ruins - Castle<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jeanne d'Arc：</span><br>
Commander, do you think we'll really find enough coins amongst these ruins?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I do. Call it a hunch.<br>
They are so committed to their job, they're still waiting for their debt to be paid even after turning into ghosts.<br>
That commitment is what has kept this castle protected for hundreds of years.<br>
The castle which we just so happen to need to get into.<br>
Everything lines up too perfectly to be a coincidence.<br>
That reminds me... Those ghosts have "lived" very long. Maybe that, too, is somehow connected to the vampire hunters.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：(Use Info Analysis on the ruins of the hall.)</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jeanne d'Arc：</span><br>
Look! The gemstone in that wall is glowing!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sheffield：</span><br>
Why, I'll be... A secret room, perchance?<br>
<br>
Some mechanism activates, slowly sliding the thick wall aside and revealing a study that has been hidden for countless years.<br>
An old smell hangs in the air and a carpet on the floor is buried under a layer of dust. The mana-powered lamps are working, though their light has become very dim.<br>
At the other end of the room is a table, atop which a golden sphere of magic silently hovers.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jeanne d'Arc：</span><br>
This spell is royal magic. It protects against time-related degradation.<br>
It is ordinarily used to preserve cultural artifacts and important documents, but– Oh!<br>
<br>
The magic sphere dispels after being touched, revealing that which it has protected for all these centuries...<br>
A handful of papers and a letter.<br>
<span style="color:#fef15e;">Duke of York：</span><br>
I am Duke of York, the matriarch of the vampire family in the human capital.<br>
Or, to be precise, I WAS the matriarch.<br>
I do not know when this letter will be read, or if it will even be found at all.<br>
Regardless, it is my duty to record the events that unfolded here.<br>
A month prior, a strange disease began to spread between my family members.<br>
At first, I thought it was a simple weakening curse.<br>
However, those afflicted with it slowly but surely lost their connection to our family. I realised that they had begun heeding someone else's voice.<br>
For long did I try to learn more, and one day I discovered that the voice was the Demon King's. This "disease" was in fact a plot to control us.<br>
But by the time I knew, it was too late to do anything about it.<br>
Now, as I write this, my beloved city is ablaze because of my kin's betrayal.<br>
I don't have much time left.<br>
Therefore, I have decided to employ the last ace up my sleeve.<br>
If it succeeds, it may save at least some lives...<br>
As well as protect the truth hidden within this chamber.<br>
In the corner, there is a chest with enough gold to pay the debt to the pirates.<br>
On the desk lies two written spells – one to break the Neverending Night, and one to exterminate the vampires.<br>
To whoever finds this letter...<br>
Please do what is right and set my family free so–<br>
<br>
The writing becomes increasingly messy before abruptly stopping.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Seydlitz：</span><br>
So the vampires didn't betray us, they were simply manipulated by the Demon King...<br>
And the reason we've all survived to this day is because of the vampires' spell...<br>
I can't say I'm happy to know that this is what the truth is like.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
But it is the truth, even if it took this long to discover.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sheffield：</span><br>
My Master is right. However much time has passed, there is no changing the truth.<br>
We now know why the city fell and who our real enemy is.<br>
Let's go, Commander. We've learned all that we'll need.<br>
We must destroy those three strongholds as soon as possible.<br>
<br>
After leaving the secret room, we give the whole chest full of old coins to the Tempesta pirates.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Whydah：</span><br>
Wait... THIS much?<br>
This is way more than what we're owed, even with centuries of interest on top.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Golden Hind：</span><br>
Goodness me, adventurers. Your generosity knows no bounds!<br>
Anyone who pays their dues so handsomely is a friend in our eyes♡<br>
As proof of our friendship, take this Seatide Horn. I'm sure it'll come in useful♪<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mary Celeste：</span><br>
Just toot it whenever you find yourself in trouble and Tempesta will be there in a flash!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Adventure Interface：</span><br>
"Notification: You have obtained the skill Seatide Horn. Rank: SSS."<br>
"Notification: You have obtained the maximum amount of skills. You need to either forget or replace a skill."<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Hmm... Throwing is my only combat skill, so I can't give that one up.<br>
There's my Sprinting skill. I've got absolutely no use out of it so far.<br>
Besides, it's not like it's impossible to sprint without the skill... right?<br>
<br>
I press the button for the Sprinting skill, replacing it with Seatide Horn.<br>

<br>
Casting the spell written on the paper, we swiftly dispelled the Neverending Night and entered the Eastern Fortress.<br>
The vampires who reside here have no idea that their protective spell has been neutralized. We quickly overwhelm them with little resistance.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">U-47：</span><br>
*cough cough*... That spell...<br>
You must've gotten it from Miss York... How do you know her?<br>
...Oh, it's all coming to me now.<br>
I can finally think clearly now that the spell has been lifted.<br>
I can't believe how long it's been...<br>
After all these centuries... I think it's time for me to sleep.<br>
What are you going to do? Take down all three fortresses?<br>
Killing me will put the other bases on high alert. You won't catch them off guard again.<br>
Bit of advice: the princess and the head maid are personally guarding the central base. I'd go there last if I were you.<br>
Take care of the western fortress first.<br>
Elbing oversees its defenses. She has a real sweet tooth.<br>
She's a sucker especially for creative desserts.<br>
I'll bet it's been ages since she's had any because of the Demon King Army's scorched earth approach.<br>
Disguise yourselves as smugglers passing through the area and tell her you'll give her a delicious dessert.<br>
If you're lucky, she might just come to see you in person.<br>
That'll be your chance to strike.<br>
...It's time for me to move on.<br>
Good luck, adventurers. Kill the Demon King.<br>

<br>
Withered Woods - Road to the Western Fortress<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jeanne d'Arc：</span><br>
This next vampire loves creative desserts... How are we going to make something like that?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nubian：</span><br>
Desserts are all about the taste.<br>
I think we just need something that's different from run-of-the-mill stuff.<br>
It just so happens I have a bunch of potions that can change how something tastes!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Liverpool：</span><br>
It should use ingredients not found in ordinary desserts, too!<br>
Slimejuu flesh would be just the thing! That's GOT to be creative!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Don't forget the color and shape!<br>
Innovating in those areas is just as important!<br>
Let's make it, I dunno... colorful! Splash it with the whole rainbow!<br>
As for the shape, it's got to be eye-catching! Something that gets your attention immediately!<br>
So, what I propose is – a big and colorful time bomb Slimejuu cake!<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：The smell! Don't forget the smell!</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：There we have it, folks!</span>'''''<br>

This is... interesting, I'll say that.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sheffield：</span><br>
I'll have to sit this one out, I'm afraid. I'm a rather poor actor.<br>
Instead, I'll observe the enemy's movements at the stronghold. Good luck, Master.<br>
<br>
Our party approaches the eastern fortress, finished Slimejuu cake held high for all to see.<br>
Just as we'd hoped, we had encountered not a single monster along the way.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">Elbing：</span><br>
Now that is a very creative cake you have...<br>
Say, are you smugglers passing through my territory?<br>
Very well. Leave the cake and pass through.<br>
Wait, actually... Hold on to the cake for me. I want to taste it at once!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Heh! She bought it! The cake has distracted her!<br>
<br>
This cake was a real doozy to make, but at least it's serving its purpose.<br>
Careless and clueless, Elbing walks up to Fu Shun. Her attention is entirely on the cake.<br>
Then... Whoosh! The vampire hunters leap out of hiding and score a hit that frees her from the Demon King's spell.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">Elbing：</span><br>
Ahh... My life is slipping from me...<br>
But... the curse's grip is lifting...<br>
I'm free. Free at long last...<br>
I've never seen a cake like yours before. You've shown me a glimpse of true creativity.<br>
And for that, I thank you...<br>
Please, save my sister and the head maid as well...<br>
May fortune be with you, O righteous adventurers...<br>

<br>
In the Withered Woods, while we're on our way to the central fortress...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sheffield：</span><br>
...Things have changed. We need to come up with a new strategy at once.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Seydlitz：</span><br>
Sheffy? What's the matter?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sheffield：</span><br>
The central fortress is doing battle with the Demon King Army.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jeanne d'Arc：</span><br>
What? They're fighting each other?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sheffield：</span><br>
You heard me.<br>
Since their other two fortresses have fallen, perhaps the Demon King is in a rush to install a new leader.<br>
It doesn't seem the takeover process is going too well. At any rate, the two sides are now duking it out.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Sounds like a golden opportunity! Let's go check it out, Commander!<br>
<br>
By the time we reach the inside of the fortress, the fighting has already concluded.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lützow：</span><br>
Ugghh... This is NOT how I thought I'd go...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Thüringen：</span><br>
It's okay, Lützow. I'm going with you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
What?! They've already taken out two of the vampires?!<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">???：</span><br>
Heheheh. What have we here? Passing adventurers?<br>
Perfect timing. I feared there'd be not a soul around to gaze upon my splendid visage.<br>

Who are you?!<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">???：</span><br>
Me?<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">Vampire：</span><br>
I am Vampire, the most flawless and powerful vampire of all!<br>
As milord hath instructed me, I have taken over this fortress.<br>
Those last-generation vampires were so weak, yet so stubborn. All I did was send them to heaven.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sheffield：</span><br>
Master, she's right about one thing – she is very powerful.<br>
On the other hand, she has been injured, that much is clear.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Seydlitz：</span><br>
Yes, I noticed that as well.<br>
Beware, though – she recovers astoundingly quickly. If we're going to attack, now is the time.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：(Use Info Analysis on her.)</span>'''''<br>
<br>
My adventure interface provides a description of her, confirming that she is indeed a mighty vampire with no weaknesses.<br>
On the bright side, she is only at half HP.<br>
In addition, my skill tells me that there is a secret trap waiting to be sprung inside the room.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(It's hidden within a folded space. That vampire maid must've rigged it before she passed on.)<br>

Everyone, into positions! Get ready for battle!<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">Vampire：</span><br>
Hahah! Thou art challenging me? Suicidal fools!<br>
Thou shall witness the terrifying might of the ultimate vampire!<br>
<br>
<br>
KABOOOM!<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">Vampire：</span><br>
Hah! Is that all? Thou think this will hold back the unsurpassable vampire?<br>

She's finally taken the bait.<br>
Yelling my orders for all to hear was the winning move.<br>
<br>
The vampire comes charging straight toward me... and springs the trap that the maid laid before she left this world.<br>
Then everything stops. Time is frozen.<br>

On behalf of all vampire hunters, thank you for all you've done.<br>
If you ever need assistance, we will always answer your call.<br>
Now that our battle here is over, we're going to spread out and tell other hunters the truth of what happened to the city all those years ago.<br>
As such, I doubt we will see each other for a short while.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sheffield：</span><br>
I'm afraid we don't have any items to give you to express our gratitude.<br>
But we can give you something else – our word. When your battle with the Demon King comes...<br>

{{折叠面板|标题=Battle of the Armory|选项=22|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<br>
The Dämonenhöhle – the Demon King's armory.<br>
Located at the heart of the lava lake, it is a key strategic point for the Demon King Army.<br>
The armory is surrounded by glowing hot lava that has been flowing for untold years. Attacking it is a nightmarish premise.<br>
It is also the base of the Dragonlord's airborne hunters division. They have been incessantly launching attacks on Sentinel Bastion from here.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jeanne d'Arc：</span><br>
Today we shall bring an end to it all.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
We meet again, Dragonlord! Remember when I kicked your butt?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nubian：</span><br>
You ran with your tail between your legs last time, but that's not happening again!<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">Blücher：</span><br>
Huh? Are you people serious?<br>
Fine, I admit I got very careless back at your precious wall!<br>
However! Now it's YOU attacking MY base! Do you really think the six of you can take all of us on?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Liverpool：</span><br>
I don't just think – I KNOW we can!<br>
You scared? Then it's not too late to surrender!<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">Blücher：</span><br>
Grrrr! You're SO annoying!<br>
Okay, hotshots! You're gonna see what happens when you REALLY mess with the airborne hunters!<br>
Dark Knight Slimejuus, give 'em hell!<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">Dark Knight Slimejuus：</span><br>
CHIIIRP! CHIIIRP!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Unicorn：</span><br>
Big brother! A huge force is coming right at us!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Sounds like the perfect time to use the Seatide Horn.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：(Activate the skill.)</span>'''''<br>
<br>
The horn resounds with a serene note, and the counterattack on the army of monsters begins.<br>
Naturally, our party members aren't the only ones attacking.<br>
With the billow of a saltwater wave, an armada of ghost pirates and their ships join the assault.<br>
With each passing second, their fleet seems to grow larger and the splashing of the waves intensifies.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Whydah：</span><br>
You sounded the Seatide Horn, so we've come just as promised.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Golden Hind：</span><br>
Heehee. It's so nice to see our generous friends again.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mary Celeste：</span><br>
Let me guess – you want us to dip our ships in the lava and capture that stronghold, am I right?<br>
Hahahah! Man! I can't remember the last time I fought in such a fun battle!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
You can say that again! I've never seen something THIS fun before!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mary Celeste：</span><br>
Holy hell... You're the goddess of pioneering and adventure! Royal Fortune!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
That's me! Good to see you all again!<br>
I heard someone sound the Seatide Horn way off in the distance.<br>
Thought I'd check it out, and what do I find? You lot, starting the party without me!<br>
So, what are we doing? Fighting the Dragonlord?<br>
Fine by me! Let's take her down!<br>
<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">Blücher：</span><br>
Aha... Ahaha...<br>
I don't get what's going on!<br>
You have an armada of ghost pirates?<br>
And there's even a goddess on your side?!<br>
This is ridiculous! How was I ever supposed to win?!<br>
<br>
The Dragonlord decries the unfairness of it all as she's reduced to bits of mana before vanishing.<br>
Meanwhile, the pirates wipe out all the monsters in and around the lava lake.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Hahaha! Now THAT was a nice battle!<br>
I'm glad I showed up! I've not had this much fun in who knows how long!<br>
Well, Tempestas, you've fulfilled your promise. It's time you come with me.<br>
As the laws of the world dictate, the dead should get to rest in peace.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Golden Hind：</span><br>
You heard her, adventurers. We kept our word and have nothing anchoring us to this world anymore.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mary Celeste：</span><br>
Finally! I've been dying – literally – for a good rest.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Whydah：</span><br>
Same... Fighting for hundreds of years takes a serious toll on the body.<br>
Farewell, charitable clients. We'll be praying for your success.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Liverpool：</span><br>
Wait, wait! Before you go, let me snap a picture of you all! Smile for the camera!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Cheese!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Liverpool：</span><br>
Thanks! Goodbye, pirates! Goodbye, goddess!<br>

<br>
After conquering the Demon King's armory and saying our farewells to the pirates, we moved on to our next objective.<br>
We're so close now. This is the final obstacle standing between us and the Demon King's castle – the supply base.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jeanne d'Arc：</span><br>
According to the old maps our holy church possesses, this place was once a port city known as Schneehafen.<br>
Some say it was the second-largest settlement in the kingdom before the Demon King seized control...<br>
I can hardly believe I'm here, seeing its ruins with my own eyes.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Unicorn：</span><br>
Big brother, I just finished scouting.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Man, soaring through the skies on Yuni's back was AMAZING!<br>
You should have seen the view from up there. It was unforgettable!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Unicorn：</span><br>
Okay, okay, now shouldn't we report what we saw?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Right. Commander, we found out something crazy!<br>
There aren't any monsters stationed at the supply base! They all ran away!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jeanne d'Arc：</span><br>
They abandoned it without a fight? I wonder if seeing what happened to the armory made their morale plummet.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Probably, though I doubt they know the pirates aren't with us anymore.<br>
This is a great opportunity to take advantage of the disarray.<br>
Everyone, move in! Capture the supply base!<br>
<br>
Demon King's Supply Base - Lord's Chamber<br>
THUD!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Come on out, archdemon! The hero is here to send you to hell!<br>
Hey... This place is empty! Nobody's here!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
So even their leader jumped ship.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nubian：</span><br>
There was barely any resistance on the way here, either. I suppose the archdemon cottoned on and legged it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Liverpool：</span><br>
Did she REALLY run away? I didn't think the Demon King's officers were THIS cowardly.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Unicorn：</span><br>
Big brother... Someone left a letter on the desk.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jeanne d'Arc：</span><br>
It could be boobytrapped. Allow me to open it for you.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">Jade：</span><br>
Dear pesky adventurers: Greetings.<br>
You caused a real mess over at the armory. I would salute you if we were allies.<br>
Clearly, you are absurdly powerful, and it's only a matter of time before you bring down the Demon King's castle.<br>
I, for one, don't feel like sacrificing myself to fight a lost battle.<br>
For that simple reason, I've turned tail and taken my leave.<br>
The supply base is all yours now.<br>
My treasure is in the chest. Take whatever you like.<br>
Should you need any supplies, you'll find them in the depot.<br>
I also left a copy of my personal favorite album behind for you. By all means, give it a listen.<br>
It has recordings of all my live concerts as well as my very best songs.<br>
Yes, I'm just that good of a girl.<br>
Should we ever have the pleasure or displeasure of running into each other again...<br>
Then I ask you to spare my life. Kindly remember that I did you a solid here today!<br>
– Yours truly, Archdemon & Demon King Army Officer & Witch Idol & Good Girl Jade<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Liverpool：</span><br>
Wow. She really did abandon the base she was in charge of.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Hmph... At least THIS demon has some sense in her skull.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Unicorn：</span><br>
But this means an archdemon got away... She'll become a problem in the future.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
At least she won't get in our way when we're fighting the Demon King herself.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Unicorn：</span><br>
Mhm... She shouldn't.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
If we ever cross paths with her again...<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：I say we let her off the hook.</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：We'll give her twice the punishment.</span>'''''<br>

<br>
With the supply base conquered, there is nothing left that stands on our path to the Demon King's castle.<br>
So close are we now that you can even clearly see the rising mana from the defensive magic being used within the castle.<br>
The time to finally confront the Demon King is here.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Whoohh... The temperature is getting higher the closer we get.<br>
Nubian, do have any potions that cool you down?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nubian：</span><br>
Hmm... I've got some instant freeze potions. Want one?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
I said "cool you down," not "turn you into a human popsicle"!<br>
Unicorn! Let me borrow Yuni for a minute!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Unicorn：</span><br>
But I don't wanna...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
I just need to fly for a bit and feel the cool wind on my– Hey!<br>
Commander! Up in the sky! Something's coming toward us!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nubian：</span><br>
Isn't that... the Fighting Angel?<br>
Dammit! The army must've sent someone to retrieve Jeanne!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Well, I won't let 'em! She's a member of our party now and nobody's taking her on my watch!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jeanne d'Arc：</span><br>
Please calm down, everyone. That's not just any soldier in our army – it's Joffre.<br>
I assure you she will understand!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Joffre：</span><br>
May the goddess of light and justice be with you.<br>
It's good to see you again, adventurers.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jeanne d'Arc：</span><br>
What brings you here so suddenly, Joffre?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Joffre：</span><br>
Her Majesty and the holy church were concerned about you, so they sent me.<br>
As I'm sure you've guessed, Her Majesty became extremely worried when you left without saying a word.<br>
She was also quite shocked to learn that your party had captured the Demon King's bases one after the next.<br>
Consequently, she called upon her troops and ordered the 13th – and hopefully final – major campaign of this millennium.<br>
The bulk of the Royal Army has left Sentinel Bastion and are on their way to aid you in your upcoming battle for the Demon King's castle.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jeanne d'Arc：</span><br>
Thank you! I couldn't ask for better news than this! This gives us assurance for the upcoming battle.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Joffre：</span><br>
Yes, but unfortunately, I have bad news as well.<br>
There exists a mountain range east of the castle. This range has been turned into a den for dragons.<br>
As you know, the dragons have been loyal to the Demon King for centuries. The Great Fire Dragon, their leader, is also one of the Demon King's few hand-picked officers.<br>
If you do not confront the dragons, there's a risk they will come to attack you during your final battle.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jeanne d'Arc：</span><br>
A good point. We should definitely deal with the dragons before we take on the Demon King herself.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Joffre：</span><br>
You certainly should.<br>
Now, I must go. I cannot stay with you any longer as I have to report to Her Majesty and the holy church.<br>
I take it you won't be coming with me, Your Holiness?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jeanne d'Arc：</span><br>
No. I am a member of this party, and I will not abandon it now.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Joffre：</span><br>
Very well. Then may the goddesses watch over you.<br>

{{折叠面板|标题=Fighting the Great Fire Dragon|选项=25|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<br>
Before us lies a battleground like something from hell itself.<br>
Centuries or even millennia-old dragons circle the skies above the volcano.<br>
The most eye-catching of them all is a titan of a monster, its body reaching hundreds of meters in length and entirely bathed in hellfire.<br>
That is the Great Fire Dragon, the leader of the dragons and the Demon King's most trusted officer.<br>
Each flap of its wings sends echoes across the mountains and churns the lava below.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jeanne d'Arc：</span><br>
Monsters so massive they all but blot out the sky... That's what we're up against.<br>
Do we really have a fighting chance?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
They have a crushing numbers advantage, and we're at a severe disadvantage in a head-on clash...<br>
We won't win by ordinary means. It's time to use one of our trump cards.<br>
Let's call in the legendary heroes.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：(Activate the Flute of Time.)</span>'''''<br>
<br>
The cool sound of the flute cuts like a knife through the sizzling hot air.<br>
As the final note finishes, four magic portals suddenly appear from thin air.<br>
From each portal emerges one of the legendary figures from long ago.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
Nice to see you again, heroes of the new age!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ayanami：</span><br>
I've never fought anything like that Great Fire Dragon before... This will be a worthwhile battle.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
I just got done upgrading my axe! Let's see how well it cuts!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
*yaaawn*... I want this over with so I can get back to my nap...<br>
<br>
The heroes set foot on the battlefield. Wasting not a moment, they jump straight toward the dragons.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jeanne d'Arc：</span><br>
Wait a moment... These girls look familiar...<br>
Aren't they the legendary party that killed the previous Demon King?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Oh, right. We didn't tell you how we met them, did we?<br>
It was an adventure in and of itself! I'll show you a pic and tell you the story after this battle's over!<br>
<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">Great Fire Dragon：</span><br>
ROOOAAARRR!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ayanami：</span><br>
Its scales are really tough... Dynamic Kick: Two-Hit Combo!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
My explosive magic won't take it out in one hit... You'll have to soften it up more.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
I'll hit it one more time! Gigaaa Crash!<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">Great Fire Dragon：</span><br>
ROOOAAARRR!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
Dammit! It used another monster to block what would've been a crippling hit! Now it's flying away to recover its health!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
It's got to be just as strong and intelligent as the Demon King herself... Girls, keep your guard up!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Lemme help you! Hero's Slaaash!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nubian：</span><br>
I'm gonna help, too! I've been saving my best potions for a big battle like this!<br>
Here we go! Beast Essence!<br>
<br>
While the battle continues on the frontlines, I monitor the situation using my status screen.<br>
In terms of strength, our party does have what it takes to defeat this great dragon.<br>
It won't be so easy, though. Our opponent is clever, using other monsters to throw us off our game while it backs off to recover its health.<br>
The battle has reached a complete stalemate.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jeanne d'Arc：</span><br>
Commander, you must let me join the fight!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I can't. You need to stay, or else the clerics will be vulnerable.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jeanne d'Arc：</span><br>
Yes, but this battle is going nowhere. The Great Fire Dragon has so much mana it'll slowly wear us down if we don't do something.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
It knows exactly what it's doing. This dragon is a clever bastard.<br>
Still, our opponent has made a miscalculation.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jeanne d'Arc：</span><br>
A... miscalculation?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Yeah. The dragon didn't account for there being one more person who could influence this battle.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jeanne d'Arc：</span><br>
One more person? Wait, you mean...<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：(Use your Throwing skill against the dragon.)</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(I've amassed quite the collection of throwables now.)<br>
(From the bombs I bought back at the city, to the stuff I picked out from the Sentinel Bastion armory, to even a few treasures I picked up on the way.)<br>
(Now it's finally time to bring my arsenal to bear.)<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">Great Fire Dragon：</span><br>
GRAAAGHH?!<br>
<br>
A hail storm of explosive items descends upon the dragon. Anyone can see this is far beyond its predictions.<br>
In a fit of panic, it dodges out of the way, missing its chance to heal itself.<br>
And so, the precarious balance in our neck and neck battle tips in our favor. Now we just need to overwhelm them.<br>
Only a few turns later, the Great Fire Dragon has finally been soundly defeated.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
Phew... Great work, everyone! That was a magnificent battle.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ayanami：</span><br>
Yes, to think you had such an awesome skill this whole time... Never judge a book by its cover.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I knew I had to hold on to at least one skill to defend myself, even if I don't personally fight in battles.<br>
Oh, I've been wondering – why doesn't your party have a healer? It can't be easy to adventure without one.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
I feel like someone else asked the same thing once...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
You don't need a healer if you can defeat all the enemies before they defeat you!<br>
Besides, it's not like our party always consisted of just us four.<br>
We had two healers when we fought today, didn't we?<br>
More is always merrier when your goal is to dethrone the Demon King!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ayanami：</span><br>
It was good to fight by your side, but now it's time to truly say goodbye.<br>
You and your party have the power. You'll wreck the Demon King, I know it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jeanne d'Arc：</span><br>
Farewell, legendary heroes...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
It's sad to see them go. At least now with the dragons out of the way, we can rest for a bit.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Wait! You're forgetting something crucial, Commander!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Am I? What?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
The dragon's treasure! We have to loot the den first! No time for breaks!<br>

The tall and black castle wall is drawing nearer.<br>
Our party has finally reached the end of its journey – the Demon King's castle.<br>
The vampire hunters got here first and have been waiting for us, just as they promised.<br>
There is a third person, too. Someone I wasn't expecting.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Friedrich Carl：</span><br>
Greetings from the goddess of steel and dragons, fearless adventurers.<br>
I heard you were attacking the Demon King's castle, so I came to support you as a representative of my church.<br>
These castle doors are thick. The divine machine I brought will take care of them.<br>
<br>
KABOOOM!<br>
The giant steel dragon breathes a furious flame, cutting through the multilayered defensive spells on the gates like a knife through butter.<br>
After the brave and dextrous vampire hunters breach the castle's frontal defenses, they lead us right to the Demon King's throneroom.<br>
Demon King's Castle - Throneroom<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Wretched demon! I have come to end you! Oh, and my party's here, too.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jeanne d'Arc：</span><br>
Your reign ends today, Demon King!<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">Devonshire：</span><br>
Tsk... Impudent little insects.<br>
Aren't you that band of adventurers who spied on me back at your precious human castle?<br>
Not only are you still alive, now you've come all the way to my throneroom.<br>
You've been lucky, but your luck ends here. I am the pinnacle of all demonkind – and you're challenging me? You must have a real death wish.<br>
Then I will give you what you desire – the sweet release of death!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
If you wanted us dead, you'd have killed us back at the royal castle. Then we would've never gotten this far.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">Devonshire：</span><br>
Perhaps so, but even I have standards!<br>
It's my job as the Demon King to wait upon my throne for you heroes to come straight to me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
She's right, you know! That's what they always do!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nubian：</span><br>
Bring it on, demon! I've got the perfect potion for the likes of you!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Unicorn：</span><br>
I-I'm ready to provide healing... I'll help as much as I can!<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">Devonshire：</span><br>
Hmph. Enough talk. Have at you!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Liverpool：</span><br>
Here we go! Our final confrontation with the Demon King is starting!<br>
<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">Devonshire：</span><br>
Feeble adventurers! I curse ye!<br>
Tides of time wash over ye, sap thy strength, and make thee weak! Writhe, writhe!<br>
Kneel! On the ground with all of thee!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jeanne d'Arc：</span><br>
*cough cough*... My god... This is the ultimate curse! Only the Demon King can cast it!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Liverpool：</span><br>
We're in serious trouble... This curse is way too advanced for me to lift!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Unicorn：</span><br>
*cough*... Big brother... I'm at my limit...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nubian：</span><br>
I can't... even muster the strength to hold a potion...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
You fiend... I am the hero! I will not fall at the last step of my journey!<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">Devonshire：</span><br>
Ahahaha! Can't fight anymore, can you?<br>
I warned you. It was a miracle that you even got this far. Thinking you could defeat me was utter foolishness.<br>
Now you will die a slow and painful death from my curse!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Adventure Interface：</span><br>
"Notification: Your skills Curse Resistance SSS and Blessing of Light SSS are in effect."<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：The battle isn't over yet.</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：Aren't you forgetting about someone?</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">Devonshire：</span><br>
Hm? How in the world are you still standing?<br>
No matter. My curse has still left the rest of your entire party squirming on the floor.<br>
Even if your abilities let you resist my curse, you're powerless to do anything against me.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
"Powerless," you say?<br>
You might want to take a look at my stats. You have the power to do that, don't you?<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">Devonshire：</span><br>
Hah! Of course I do. I am the apex of demonkind – seeing an adventurer's stats is child's play for...<br>
What... the hell?!<br>
No... That's impossible...<br>
Level 999... 999,999 HP, 999,999 MP, 9,999 ATK, and 9,999 DEF? How?!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Took you long enough.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">Devonshire：</span><br>
How does one even raise their base stats that ludicrously high?<br>
You're telling me it WASN'T pure luck that you killed my Great Fire Dragon?!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Damn right. I can even beat you all by myself.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">Devonshire：</span><br>
You little rat! You kept your stats to yourself this whole time!<br>
Out of your whole party, YOU'RE the strongest by a long shot!<br>
<br>
......<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：(Pick up Fu Shun's sword with your one hand.)</span>'''''<br>
......<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：(Pick up Jeanne d'Arc's sword with the other.)</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">Devonshire：</span><br>
Wh-what are you doing?<br>
Wait! We can still talk this out!<br>
I'm the Demon King, remember? Whatever your king promised you for my head, I'll make it double!<br>
NO! GET AWAY FROM MEEE!<br>

<br>
Thus, the Demon King was slain.<br>
The world was at peace once more.<br>
The party of heroes returned to the Royal Capital and were given a warm welcome befitting their valorous feat.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">King George V：</span><br>
The jubilant people threw a grand celebration that lasted over half a month.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jeanne d'Arc：</span><br>
Though the saint Jeanne d'Arc did flee her post, she was not punished for it.<br>
<br>
After all the festivities, Fu Shun suggested that the party pay a visit to Ursp Village.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bristol：</span><br>
There, the village mayor hosted a spectacular banquet for the triumphant heroes as she had promised.<br>
While more modest than the celebration in the capital, it was certainly more intimate and full of warmth.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nubian：</span><br>
Following that, Nubian returned to Thermalq Village and went back to providing free medical care for the villagers.<br>
Now famous for her actions, this potion maker experienced an endless influx of nobles coming all the way from the capital to seek her services.<br>
One day, she acquired herself a grand mansion on the outskirts of the village.<br>
<br>
The potion maker never did bring anyone else to Silverbank Island. She was simply too busy with other things.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Arkhangelsk：</span><br>
As such, the wise and mysterious witch Arkhangelsk ended up forgotten by history.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Liverpool：</span><br>
Liverpool and Unicorn joined the holy church in the capital and devoted themselves to honing their skills.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Unicorn：</span><br>
Later, they went on to become the right-hand women of the new pontiff, Jeanne d'Arc.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jeanne d'Arc：</span><br>
Their service continued for the rest of their long lives granted by their goddess.<br>
<br>
After committing hundreds of years of their lives to fighting a lonesome war in the uninhabited wastes, the vampire hunters were finally acknowledged and accepted by the kingdom.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Seydlitz：</span><br>
Sheffield and Seydlitz both were given noble titles and the honor of ruling the enormous territory in and around the central fortress that the vampires once held.<br>
<br>
Word that life had returned to the Wasteland quickly reached all the corners of the kingdom.<br>
As a result, the whole kingdom experienced a settlement boom.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fei Yuen：</span><br>
Fei Yuen, the mayor of Friede Village, rode this wave of expansion and led a group of settlers to reclaim the ruins of the port city Schneehafen.<br>
The lands were purified, bringing back the snowfall. Water once more filled the Frozen Lake rather than lava, and the former ruins were reborn into a great city full of life.<br>
The one who led the settlers to the city, Fei Yuen, would later become its mayor.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vanguard：</span><br>
The Demon King's defeat led to the kingdom becoming quite busy.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Algérie：</span><br>
Having seen the destruction of the Demon King's castle, the Royal Army split into groups and left Sentinel Bastion behind.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">L'Indomptable：</span><br>
Each of the loyal knights led their own battalion, establishing countless new bases across the revitalized lands, watching over settlers and travelers alike.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Joffre：</span><br>
The restoration of the Royal Crown Wall Ruins went orderly, thanks to the oversight of the holy church.<br>
<br>
The ruins of the old Royal Capital, on the other hand, were simply too decayed. The king was forced to give up on her plans to restore them.<br>
However, the many artifacts buried among the rubble proved a great source of wealth all the same.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hero：</span><br>
To this end, the army issued a large number of commissions to guilds, attracting countless adventurers to explore the ruins.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Among them, Fu Shun the Hero.<br>
She was offered to join the Royal Knights, but declined, instead choosing to continue traveling the Wasteland.<br>
She knew that somewhere out there, an archdemon was waiting for an opportunity to rise from the darkness.<br>
<span style="color:#fef15e;">Bard：</span><br>
Finally, there's the fate of that commander, which remains a mystery.<br>
Some say this hero became a lord over some remote region.<br>
Others say this legendary figure went back to the witch in the tower and became her disciple for a hundred years.<br>
There are also some local chronicles that say the commander created a new party and traveled to distant lands in search of the New World.<br>
Some folk records even claim that this human was in fact the true Demon King and was now in control of the entire kingdom.<br>
But, if you asked the other members of this legendary party what they thought...<br>
They would tell you that the commander is probably off in some peaceful place, enjoying the quiet life.<br>
<br>
The future holds countless possibilities.<br>
But for now, you can put down your swords and rest.<br>
The End<br>

<br>
After closing the game, I head to the Iron Blood dorm to speak to Friedrich Carl.<br>
*knock knock*<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Friedrich Carl：</span><br>
Come in! The door is unlocked.<br>
<br>
Stepping inside her room, I see her lying down on the carpet.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Friedrich Carl：</span><br>
Heehee. If it isn't the brave little soul who dethroned the Demon King. Why are you here?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I guess you could say I'm returning the favor for that one night.<br>
You know, at Sentinel Bastion, when you paid me a sudden visit.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Friedrich Carl：</span><br>
Ah, yes, you didn't close out of the game that night. Don't you know that playing for too long isn't good for you?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
What can I say? The celebrations ran late.<br>
But that's not what I came to talk about. I have a question.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Friedrich Carl：</span><br>
Yes? I was on the production team, so I should have an answer for you.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
......<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：What was your role in the story?</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：Can you tell me about the goddesses' roles?</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项3：What's the story behind the wise witch and the ancient heroes?</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Friedrich Carl：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Heehee. I'll admit my role wasn't quite as simple as a mere mechanic.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''I appeared out of nowhere to help you on your quest, and more than just once.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''As for why I did... Well, the game is meant to have an open ending.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''You're welcome to create your own theory for it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Friedrich Carl：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Ah, the goddesses. Our discussions about those were pretty passionate.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Perhaps unsurprisingly, project members were given priority for those roles.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''First, there's the goddess of beginnings and ends. Bristol gave that title to Saratoga.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''She also chose TB for the role of the goddess of order and rules.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''On the other hand, Valiant quite insistently nominated Queen Elizabeth to be the goddess of desserts and tea parties.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''The title of goddess of revivals and baths was similarly forced upon Veneto by Marco Polo.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Then there's the goddess of steel and dragons. Eugen evaluated candidate after candidate until she chose Bismarck in the end.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''The role of goddess of fire and purity was a three-way nomination between Ayanami, Ikazuchi, and Inazuma, who chose Akagi.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''That one actually had an alternative name proposed. I think it was "goddess of fire and agriculture."<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''It didn't make the cut because people thought it was too difficult to understand.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Anyway... Clemenceau nominated herself for the role of goddess of darkness and conspiracy and also picked Richelieu to be the goddess of light and justice.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Goddess of unity and toughness went to Soyuz. Pamiat' endorsed her.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Meanwhile, Hai Tien thought Yat Sen would be a good pick for the goddess of peace and protection.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Finally, there's the goddesses of pioneering and adventure and luck and riches. Those two were self-nominated.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''That should be all of them, I think.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''And what about the ancient gods?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Friedrich Carl：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''For those, I'll have to say... Stay tuned, my dear little one♪<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Friedrich Carl：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项3）</span>'''''Heehee. It's a very interesting story, I can tell you that.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项3）</span>'''''Long, looong ago, humans and dragons and vampires all managed to coexist.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项3）</span>'''''The power structure of the old world was completely different from the new world. More mysterious, too...<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项3）</span>'''''So Hai Tien says, anyway. She wrote a lot of background lore about them.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项3）</span>'''''If we ever add more content, I'm sure they'll appear in it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Friedrich Carl：</span><br>
Oh, one more thing...<br>
As you've probably already figured out, everyone who worked on the game got to choose a special bonus for their efforts.<br>
Some chose to appear in it as goddesses, others gave themselves unique and powerful items.<br>
Then there's me... Heehee. I chose to create a very special place.<br>
It's a mysterious hideout, tucked away in a corner of the world where nobody will find it.<br>
Furnished with all the things Ballad Castle did at the peak of the city's prosperity...<br>
It's a beautiful place where love and music hang in the air from dawn 'til dusk.<br>
Would you like to see it?<br>
Then let's go and visit it, just the two of us.<br>
