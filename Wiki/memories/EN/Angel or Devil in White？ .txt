Angel or Devil in White?<br>
<br>
Chapter 1 - Resupply Surprise?!<br>
Port - Plaza<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
Nya~ Today's supply shipment can probably last a long time~ It's good that the Navy isn't stingy with these things, nya~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shiranui：</span><br>
Isn't that obvious...? What kind of war effort would be too stingy to deliver supplies to its front lines...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
That may be true, but just seeing so many supplies makes me happy, nya~ It feels nice knowing that others have our backs, nya~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shiranui：</span><br>
... Even you can say something nice every now and then.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
Nya?! A compliment, from Shiranui? Ahh, big trouble, nya! Is the world coming to an end, nya?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shiranui：</span><br>
You little... Well, whatever, let's see... you have ammunition, food, medical supplies, and... what's this?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
Nya?! Lemme see, nya!<br>
What is this, nya? Cosplay?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shiranui：</span><br>
It appears to be... some kind of nurse uniform...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vampire：</span><br>
Did someone say nurse uniform?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
Uunya?! Where'd you come from, Vampire?! You surprised me, nya!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vampire：</span><br>
I was just passing through.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shiranui：</span><br>
If that's the case, could you stop trying to compare that outfit to your own size...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vampire：</span><br>
Eh? What's the harm? Look, it's a liiittle small, but isn't that perfect for me?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shiranui：</span><br>
... But you're not even a nurse. If anything, the dumb cat here would probably count.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
Nya?! If I have to wear that, count me out, nya!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vampire：</span><br>
... Hehh~<br>
Now you've said it. Are you forgetting that I'm one of the most experienced destroyers in the Royal Navy? Nursing is as easy for me as afternoon tea!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
Really, nya?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vampire：</span><br>
A~ny~ways~! I'll be taking this nurse uniform off your paws!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
... And there she goes, nya...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shiranui：</span><br>
Well, since it's just an outfit, we can just ask Commander to deduct it from her paycheck. Let's continue checking the supplies and worry about that later.<br>

<br>
Chapter 2 - Vampire's Allure<br>
Port - Dorms<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vampire：</span><br>
... I said all that, but what is a nurse supposed to do anyway? ... Maybe I should ask around first.<br>
<br>
One hour later...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vampire：</span><br>
... W-well, looks like it's a lot more complicated than I thought... Maybe I'll have to ask Vestal for some advice...<br>
<br>
Port - Office, a few days later...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vampire：</span><br>
... And, thy temperature is fine, too~♪ Commander, thou art quite the healthy one~♪ <br>
Do you notice something different about me today~?<br>
That's right. Today, I'm a nurse. The thing that thou loveth so... want to take a peek?<br>
But thou cannot~ since this outfit is a little small...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">London：</span><br>
Ahem. Pardon the interruption.<br>
Your Excellency, please check this supply shipment.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vampire：</span><br>
Hmph... Just when I was getting to the fun part...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">London：</span><br>
Miss Vampire... I won't judge your hobbies, but perhaps it would be wise to keep the time and place in mind?<br>
Besides, wearing this kind of outfit to work is, how do I put this... a bit sleazy...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vampire：</span><br>
Ehhh?! This is a proper nurse outfit, all right? I changed into it to take care of Commander! What, dost thou not trust me?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">London：</span><br>
Um, I don't think my trust matters here...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vampire：</span><br>
What dost thou think, Commander? Thou trusts me, right?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：……</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vampire：</span><br>
Hmph! Fine, since you both don't believe me, I'll prove that I wasn't just wearing this to try to seduce Commander!<br>
<br>
Vampire stormed out of the office.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">London：</span><br>
I never accused her of trying to seduce anyone...<br>
But maybe I did go a bit overboard... Sorry, Your Excellency. I'll make sure to apologize to Vampire later.<br>

Chapter 3 - Vampire, New Nurse?<br>
Port - Hallway<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vampire：</span><br>
What's their deal anyway! I just figured Commander might want some eye candy after working so hard all day...!<br>
Big dumb bully Commander! I don't care anymore!<br>
I even went through all the trouble of learning how to be a nurse... Hmph! I'll just have to make that big dummy speechless with how good I am at taking care of people!<br>
Javelin, is there anything bothering you?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
Ah, Vampire!<br>
Oh um, not particularly...? I feel pretty perky right now!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vampire：</span><br>
...<br>
Glowworm, surely your head hurts from headbutting things left and right! Here, come lie on this table and let Nurse Vampire take care of you!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Glowworm：</span><br>
Hey, don't pull on me...! I'm perfectly fine!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vampire：</span><br>
...<br>
Laffey, you'll catch a cold if you fall asleep here. Here, use this blanket.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
... Ugh... Hot... Heavy...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vampire：</span><br>
...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">London：</span><br>
Um... Miss Vampire...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vampire：</span><br>
Huh? London? Hmm, I bet you're here to apologize for earlier~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">London：</span><br>
Um, I did plan on that, but... Commander's calling for you...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vampire：</span><br>
Ah! So that big dummy is also having second thoughts about being so cold to poor little Vampire! Good thing I'm not the type to hold grudges~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">London：</span><br>
*sigh*...<br>

<br>
Chapter 4 - Emergency?<br>
Port - Office<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vampire：</span><br>
Huh...? I'm bothering others...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">London：</span><br>
Well, I wouldn't say bothering, but there are some who are concerned about you...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vampire：</span><br>
...<br>
I see... so I'm the bad guy here...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">London：</span><br>
Ah, no, not at all! Vampire, you tried to do a good thing by helping others, and we all respect that...<br>
I am very sorry for what I said!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vampire：</span><br>
No, even I know that I'm the one at fault here...<br>
I can't even do the basics properly, and who needs a nurse like that... I suppose I'll return this outfit to Akashi and apologize to everyone...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">London：</span><br>
Vampire, actually...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Uzuki：</span><br>
Commander, there's trouble!!<br>
Mutsuki got sick all of a sudden! Wh-what should we do?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vampire：</span><br>
What?!<br>
... London, can I wait a little bit to return this outfit?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">London：</span><br>
Commander? Understood.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vampire：</span><br>
All right...! London, please call Akashi and Vestal. Commander and I will go see Mutsuki. Is that fine?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">London：</span><br>
Understood!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vampire：</span><br>
Let's go, Commander! We can't keep the patient waiting!<br>

Chapter 5 - Vampire, Pro Nurse!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mutsuki：</span><br>
Comainder...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kisaragi：</span><br>
Will Mutsuki be okay...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vampire：</span><br>
Everything will be okay. Vestal says it's just an ordinary fever. But, we have to do our part here too. Kisaragi, mind bringing bring me two towels and a basin of water?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kisaragi：</span><br>
Yes ma'am!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vampire：</span><br>
And now to finish up... all right! I'll go find some medicine for her to take, and with some rest, she should feel better in no time! Commander, please stay with Mutsuki. She'll feel at ease with thee at her side.<br>
Mutsuki, everything will be fine. We're all here for you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mutsuki：</span><br>
Okay...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
Don't you worry, nya. When you wake up, you'll feel back to normal, nya? ...Huh? My job here is already done, nya?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vampire：</span><br>
Phew... thank goodness.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
Vampire, you're quite capable, nya. Have you considered a future as a battlefield nurse, nya?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vampire：</span><br>
... Not really. I just took a glance at the basics. There's no way I'd be able to handle the actual job.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">London：</span><br>
Huh? Weren't you staying up late studying some technical stuff every night?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vampire：</span><br>
Eh?! H-how'd you know, London?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">London：</span><br>
Um, Javelin told me... She was worried about your health because of it. Nobody ever said you were doing something bad.<br>
Vampire, I didn't get a chance to tell you earlier, but... you really looked like the real deal just now.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vampire：</span><br>
... I see.<br>
Well then, Commander, can I keep this outfit then? For purposes other than seduction~<br>
... Of course, I'll make sure to do my job properly too! Thou hast my promise!<br>
<br>
She never said she'd stop trying to seduce me though... I guess some Vampires never change.<br>
