Sugary Concord<br>
<br>
Chapter 1: A Sweet Girl?<br>
Port - Commander's Office<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Concord：</span><br>
Nnnh~~ I've been working for a good while, so I deserve a sugar break~<br>
<br>
After poking at paperwork for a little bit, Concord stretched herself out lazily and casually slipped a lollipop into her mouth.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Concord：</span><br>
Mmhmm~ that hits the spot! Lollipops are the best after a long day of work!<br>
Hehe, Commander, want a sugar refuel? It's great for your work productivity and your brainpower, you know? I have a lot more candy in my pockets~<br>
<br>
Once she gets going about sugar, good luck getting her to stop.<br>
... ...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Concord：</span><br>
Ahh, I'll have to get by from just thinking about sugar. There are still many training reports on that table waiting to be compiled~<br>
Gotta work hard~♪<br>
Hey! Mutsuki, wanna trade lollipops?<br>
Isn't that dummy Omaha? ...Ah, she's buying snacks again. Maybe I should go swipe some later, hehe~<br>
Aha, done with work~ Sooo tired~ Hurry up and come give me a massage~♪<br>
<br>
Concord, who has a tendency to wear her heart on her sleeves, certainly shows no intention of doing any actual work.<br>
However, it is also undeniable that the reports get properly compiled... Remarkable indeed.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Concord：</span><br>
Commander, come give me a shoulder massage~ I'll make sure to pay you back, okay~?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Give her a shoulder massage</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Concord：</span><br>
Hehe, that hurts so good~ Commander, you're also pretty skilled at giving massages.<br>
Great~ Now to repay you~<br>
<br>
Instead of reaching for candy, Concord slipped behind me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Concord：</span><br>
Hehe, sit down already~ As a reward, Commander, I'll also give you a shoulder rub~<br>
<br>
Her idea of a "massage" was lighter than a breeze brushing over my skin. Maybe that's just the Concord style.<br>

<br>
Chapter 2: It's Buffet Time!<br>
Some number of days later...<br>
I was invited to go to a confectionery with three members of the Omaha-class.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Concord：</span><br>
Hey~ hurry up, the confectionery is just ahead!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Omaha：</span><br>
Ohh! Just seeing the sign is filling me with fighting spirit! Sweets are a form of snacks, after all!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Raleigh：</span><br>
Getting excited whenever food is mentioned... jeez...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Concord：</span><br>
Don't worry, Li'l Raleigh! Whatever you can't finish, I will take care of~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Raleigh：</span><br>
How many times do I have to tell you, I'm the elder sister! Address me accordingly!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Omaha：</span><br>
Save it 'til after we're inside, okay~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Concord：</span><br>
The variety here isn't half bad~ gotta try the strawberry sundae first though!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Raleigh：</span><br>
F-for the time being... I'm going to go with one of these exquisite macarons.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Omaha：</span><br>
Ooohh~ a Napoleon cake! I'm not gonna hold back!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Concord：</span><br>
Sis, didn't you say you were trying to lose weight? As soon as you come here, you grab enough cake for five people.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Omaha：</span><br>
Haha, sweets are also a form of snacks! For the sake of delicious snacks, we won't talk about stuff like weight loss!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Raleigh：</span><br>
Having that said, Concord, you're awfully loaded with desserts over there as well.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Concord：</span><br>
Before she realized it, in front of Concord was an ever-growing array of plates of various shapes and sizes. It was as if she was being surrounded by an army of sweets.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Raleigh：</span><br>
Jeez, if you don't show some restraint in your snacking, you're soon going to need a new wardrobe.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Concord：</span><br>
Tisk tisk tisk! Don't you know, refuelling my sugar supply is a daily obligation!<br>
There's a difference between sugar and casual snacks, you know~<br>
So, let's just cut loose and eat, hehe~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Omaha：</span><br>
Hmm~ doing anything requires willpower, and Concord's determination to fill up with more sugar is certainly awe-inspiring!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Raleigh：</span><br>
You guys...<br>
<br>
Goaded onward by Concord, I ended the day filled to the brim with sugar once again.<br>

<br>
Chapter 3: Concert<br>
Time passed very quickly-<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Concord：</span><br>
Commander, if you don't have any other plans tonight, why don't you come with me to the open-air concert~<br>
After finishing work, Concord appeared in front of me with two concert tickets in hand.<br>
Hehe, it's a performance by Lady Lexington~<br>
Unusual, right? She rarely performs live. I'm a huge fan, you know~<br>
Concord, starry-eyed with excitement, was clearly looking forward to it.<br>
<br>
We rushed to the concert venue in a hurry-<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Concord：</span><br>
Hurry up, Commander! The show's about to start~ We have the best seats in the house, right in front of the stage!<br>
We'll be able to feast our eyes on Lady Lexington!<br>
By the way, Lady Lexington is a very kind person~<br>
At the last meet-and-greet, I not only got to shake her hand, but also even received a cake from her! She was very happy as well...<br>
<br>
It seemed like Concord would never run out of things to say about Lexington.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Concord：</span><br>
Lady Lexington is here! Commander!<br>
Lady Lex~☆! I love you!!<br>
Hehe...<br>
The performance soon reached its climax. Though the surrounding people were all swept away by the energy of the performance, Concord conversely seemed to fall into a solemn silence, her eyes fixed upon the figure on the stage.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Perhaps this is what longing looks like</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：Pat her head</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Concord：</span><br>
Commander... will I be able to stand out like her one day?<br>
Even though Concord already sticks out from the crowd like a sore thumb...<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Agree with her</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Concord：</span><br>
Commander... Hehe... unexpectedly, you're quite the smooth talker~<br>
<br>
It seems that I've been able to discover a side of Concord that she normally doesn't show.<br>

<br>
Chapter 4: The Sugar Alliance?<br>
One day, I received an invitation to an event commemorating the formation of Dunkerque "Sugar Alliance."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Radford：</span><br>
The entire room is so fragrant! Miss Dunkirk sure is amazing~<br>
The candy on the table also tastes so good!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mutsuki：</span><br>
Wow! The good stuff is finally coming, fresh from the oven!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dunkerque：</span><br>
I've kept you all waiting. The unique specialty desserts are now being served.<br>
<br>
All the sweets lovers had been congregated under the same roof.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dunkerque：</span><br>
Were the desserts today to everyone's liking? I hope that I was able to satisfy your tastes.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mutsuki：</span><br>
Delish! Can Mutsuki eat some more?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Radford：</span><br>
Miss Dunkirk makes the best macarons of all!<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Try a piece</span>'''''<br>
<br>
Indeed, it's very good... Surely Concord would enjoy this too. Eh?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Concord：</span><br>
(Haaah~)<br>
Mmmh~ So delicious~ *chews*<br>
(But if I eat too many macarons, I'll get tired of them.))<br>
(After all, macarons are just a snack. I want to eat something drizzled with cream after all...)<br>
Ah, hehe~ Commander, I didn't say anything~<br>
(Haaah~)<br>
<br>
Was it just my imagination, or did I hear someone sighing<br>
But in the face of such overwhelming sweetness, how come Concord was unmoved?<br>

<br>
Chapter 5: Determination<br>
A few more days passed. I had just finished the routine inspections when...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Concord：</span><br>
Phew, I'm a bit sore from walking so much today~ Commander, come give me a foot rub~ Hehe~♪<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Accommodate her request</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Concord：</span><br>
Hahaha~ Commander, it tickles~♪<br>
However, if you use the same strength every time, it won't feel fresh after a while~ Hehe, I'd get bored~<br>
Eating the same thing that someone else made every day... who is to say that won't get stale as well? What do you think?<br>
<br>
Concord's eyes turned up towards the ceiling, as if purposefully changing the topic to sweets.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Concord：</span><br>
For me, ever since Dunkerque Sugar Alliance meeting, I've been thinking...<br>
I can't always be imposing on Dunkirk. Plus, I'd get tired of eating the same thing~<br>
How about this~ I'll learn to make sweets as well, and then Commander can try some!<br>
<br>
Under Concord's intentful gaze, I nodded in agreement.……<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Omaha：</span><br>
Woah, seeing Concord this motivated makes me proud!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Raleigh：</span><br>
Concord, you haven't made any sweets before though, right?<br>
Just make sure not to give up halfway like last time~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Concord：</span><br>
I already told you! I'm super serious this time!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Raleigh：</span><br>
Oh? We shall wait and see then.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Omaha：</span><br>
I will cheer for you! If you do a good job, I'll only eat your snacks for the next year!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Concord：</span><br>
Eheh~ You'll all be conquered by my sweets!<br>
However, the first taste tester has to be none other than the Commander~♪<br>
Concord's eyes burned bright with determination.<br>

<br>
Chapter 6: Taste Tester?<br>
Concord began to study the art of making sweets...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Concord：</span><br>
Oh~ so this is how you do it, looks like it'll be a breeze~☆<br>
And done! Hehe~ Concord's red velvet cake!<br>
Commander, the cake looks pretty good, doesn't it.<br>
<br>
The appearance... was nothing to write home about. The taste also had a long ways to go. Namely, it was way too sweet!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Concord：</span><br>
Ugh... you look a bit dissatisfied. Commander sure is picky~♪<br>
I'll make sure to work harder~<br>
Hey hey, today is my favorite strawberry sundae~<br>
Commander, what do you think?<br>
Concord, starry eyed, seemed to be waiting for a certain response...<br>
<br>
Her idea of a sundae was just a ball of shaved ice mixed with a massive amount of sugar.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Concord：</span><br>
Ugh~ looks like there's still some room for improvement.<br>
Today, I have an even bigger surprise ready for you~<br>
<br>
It was definitely a surprise - she somehow managed to kick the sweetness up a further notch.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Concord：</span><br>
It's no good after all, huh?<br>
Turns out, I don't have any talents... and I'm bit of a klutz...<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Console her</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Concord：</span><br>
Eh? Don't make too many changes... and just focus on making improvements to one thing... and it'll be fine?<br>
Hmm... I suppose that makes sense~<br>
<br>
Concord leaned against me, her body giving off a gentle warmth.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Concord：</span><br>
Hehe~ Commander, it's decided then~ Next time, be my first taste tester as well~<br>

<br>
Chapter 7: From Concord, with Sugar<br>
The Sugar Alliance held its next sweets summit...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dunkerque：</span><br>
Thank you for waiting. Today's first dish will be pancakes.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mutsuki：</span><br>
Pancakes with lots of sugar!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Omaha：</span><br>
Wahaha! Just looking at them gets my appetite going!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Concord：</span><br>
Mm... hmm... *smiles weakly*<br>
<br>
Just like last time, Concord seems a bit subdued.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dunkerque：</span><br>
And this is the last of the sweets today. Everyone, please enjoy it!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Radford：</span><br>
Oohhhh!<br>
<br>
After the gathering...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Concord：</span><br>
Commander, I prepared something for you~ Just wait a minute, okay~♪<br>
<br>
After a little while...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Concord：</span><br>
Concord's special macarons have arrived~ Hehe, I got a lot of help from Miss Dunkirk~<br>
Commander, as Concord's taste tester, please be the first to give these a try~<br>
I won't let you down this time~<br>
<br>
An assortment of colorful macarons are displayed on the plate. Is she trying to consider the varying tastes of different people?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Taste a macaron</span>'''''<br>
<br>
As expected... it's still very sweet. However-<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Concord：</span><br>
Is it delicious? Eh? It... has a very "Concord" flavor? Really? Hehe, thanks for your praise~<br>
After all, sweets have to be packed with sugar, or it won't be just right~<br>
<br>
Although there was a lot of room for improvement, one could say that it was definitely full of Concord's personality.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Tell Concord, "it's best to be yourself."</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Concord：</span><br>
Hehe~ Commander, if you're going to say that much, you should eat a few more~<br>
Ahhhn~<br>
