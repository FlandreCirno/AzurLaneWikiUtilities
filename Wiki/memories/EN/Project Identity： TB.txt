Port - Office<br>
TB and I engage in a staredown through the computer screen.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Ahem... TB, remember what we discussed before? Did you find an answer?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB ：</span><br>
Synchronizing analysis module. Unable to grasp the information surrounding the concept of "personality."<br>
Analyzing the data did not lead to any answers to my questions pertaining to emotional cognition.<br>
<br>
TB brought up a very tricky subject just the other day. She said that she feels she lacks a personality.<br>
My first thought was to provide her with some texts on the subject so she could figure it out for herself, which seemingly wasn't enough.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Sounds like just feeding you information won't get you any closer to figuring it out...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB ：</span><br>
Database entry: "personality" typically refers to the collection of traits unique to an individual, or to an individual's particular way of thinking.<br>
While I can describe what a personality is, I do not understand where a so-called personality comes from.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Where it comes from? Hmm...<br>
<br>
Just then, a daring idea crosses my mind.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
This might be a weird question, but please entertain me...<br>
Do you remember what it was like to be a kid?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB ：</span><br>
Digital assistants such as I generally do not have periods matching the criteria of "being a kid."<br>
Synchronizing analysis module. You are saying that there is a connection between childhood and personality.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Correct. Do you think your lack of a childhood is the root of the problem?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB ：</span><br>
Initiating data categorization and engaging analysis module.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Don't think about it too hard. Just tell me the first thing that comes to mind based on what I just said.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB ：</span><br>
Orders received. Halting analysis.<br>
I believe the existence of a link is possible. However, this theory has no supporting evidence. It is merely a logical inference based on the conversation thus far.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
That's all I need.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB ：</span><br>
Are you suggesting that you have found an answer?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Sort of, but I can't share it with you yet. I'll say this, though – you can stop all the work you're doing for a few months.<br>
I have something planned for you. Something only you can do.<br>
I'm not exactly sure how it's going to work out. Just know that I'll tell you when everything is ready.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB ：</span><br>
Orders received. System entering special standby mode. I will reinitialize only upon your explicit orders.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Just have to provide Akashi with a goal and supplies, and she should be able to make it work.)<br>

<br>
I step into Akashi's workshop.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
Ah, Commander, nya. What can I do for you, nya?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
It's a lot to explain...<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：(Tell her the gist of it.)</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Hmm. I see how it is, nya.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
You want to ease TB's woes about personality, nya.<br>
The thing is, an AI can't grow up if they don't have a physical body to grow IN, nya. TB is not gonna develop a personality as it stands now, nya.<br>
But if making a physical body is off the table, making a virtual city for her to live in could do the trick, nya.<br>
Then she'll experience what it's like to grow up and develop her own personality, little by little, nya.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Can you make something like that?</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''I can try, nya.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
However...<br>
I want a teensy little thing in exchange, nya.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
And what would that be?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
9,999,999,999,999 coins, nya!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Nine TRILLION?! Are you kidding me?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
Nya?<br>
That's my price after a generous discount, nya.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Dare I ask what the original price was?<br>
<br>
I took the bait and asked the foolish question. Akashi cracks a grin, then whispers a number into my ear.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
......<br>
.........<br>
Fine, I'll take it! You have a deal!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
A snappy answer, just the way I like it, nya!<br>
Always a pleasure doing business with you, nya.<br>
Come back in a month and I'll have it ready for you, nya.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
A whole month? There's no way you need that much time.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
It's actually a lot less than I'd like to have, nya. This is complicated, intricate work we're talking about, nya.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
That's a shame. I suppose I'll take my business to da Vinci instead, then.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
I-I was just kidding, nya! Give me 20 days, no, 10 days is all I need, nya!<br>
I'll come knocking with good news before you know it, nya!<br>

<br>
Ten days later…<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
Commander, do you know what day it is today, nya?<br>
Tadah! It's the completion day of TB's virtual town, nya!<br>
Take this, nya.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
What am I looking at here?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
The Akashi Workshop's latest and greatest immersion interface, nya!<br>
Wear this and you'll feel like you're actually touching things in the virtual world, nya!<br>
TB exists in the virtual world, and you live in the real world, nya. A barrier stands between you two, nya...<br>
But this device will tear that barrier down, nya!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
That sounds incredible. Did you make this all by yourself? If so, great job.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
It wasn't just me, nya. Others around the port chipped in to make it real, nya.<br>
But that's not important, nya! Use it and see what it's like, nya!<br>
TB will be there shortly, nya.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Whoa, wait a sec...<br>
<br>
Akashi puts the dubious device on me before I can properly protest. A blinding bright light flickers, and everything around me changes.<br>

<br>
My vision gradually returns to me, and a scene takes form.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Looks like a living room.<br>
<br>
It is decorated with cute furniture and furnishings, creating a very familial atmosphere.<br>
Warming sunshine permeates through the curtains, making me feel naturally at ease.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Akashi did say TB would be here "shortly"...<br>
Maybe I should do something to welcome her.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：(Tidy up the place.)</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：(Take a seat.)</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Yeah, I think I'll make the place look nice.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''However, upon closer inspection, it becomes clear that there is nothing TO tidy up. The living room is clean and orderly.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Never mind. I'll just sit and wait.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''......<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''All of a sudden, I feel tense.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Whew...<br>
<br>
I take a deep breath to relax while I look at the clock.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I should've asked when exactly TB would show up...<br>
<br>
Just as I start to worry, there is a soft knock-knock on the front door.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
......<br>
......<br>
<br>
I briefed TB on the details of my plan before I went in and more or less got her acknowledgment.<br>
While in this virtual space, all her functions save for her most fundamental cognition are disabled, and she can't access her memory in the real world.<br>
This is so that she can get an authentic experience of growing up.<br>
I knew what I signed up for, but I wasn't expecting TB to be this tiny.<br>
That said, my surprise quickly gives way to a sense of responsibility.<br>
That's right – I made a promise to her, so I must help solve her problem.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Welcome home, TB.<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=New Life - Part 1|选项=5|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<br>
...<br>
...?<br>
TB stares at me with eyes brimming with curiosity.<br>
While I'm used to the shipgirls at the port staring at me, it feels different when little TB does it. It's making me feel oddly flustered.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
So, uh... Do you remember who I am?<br>
<br>
...<br>
Co-man-dur?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Incredible...<br>
You just called me Commander, didn't you?<br>
<br>
She must be mistaking my question for an instruction and begins to repeat the word.<br>
Com...man...der?<br>
Although she is struggling with the pronunciation, she just gave me a glimpse of her astonishing language-acquisition ability, having learned a new word instantly.<br>
At the same time, her referring to me as "Commander" at such a young age somehow doesn't sit right with me.<br>
If I'm going to ask her to call me something else, now would be a good time.<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=New Life - Part 2|选项=6|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<br>
Now that that's settled, what do I do next?<br>
TB is still standing there, staring at me inquisitively.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I decide we should sit down and relax. I gesture towards the couch for her to take a seat.<br>
<br>
Hmm...?<br>
She tilts her head to the side. She doesn't understand what I mean.<br>
I take her hand and lead her right to the couch, with some difficulty.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
How about we sit down and rest our legs?<br>
<br>
...Okay.<br>
Before I can reach down to give her a hand, she climbs up on the couch with her own strength.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Wow. This is a novel sight.<br>
<br>
Hmm...?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Never mind. TB, this is going to be our home from now on.<br>
<br>
Resting her jaw on the backrest of the couch, she shifts her gaze from place to place around the room.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
...Not listening, huh.<br>
<br>
And so, my life with TB inside the virtual world begins.<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=Loving Warmth|选项=7|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Alright, that's all the ingredients chopped up.<br>
<br>
Despite all this being virtual, I can feel the texture of the ingredients and smell them as though they were real.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Man. The things you can do with money...<br>
<br>
I remember the fee I paid to Akashi to develop this device, and my eyes start to water.<br>
That's when I feel something tugging on the sleeve of my shirt.<br>
It's TB.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Are you hungry? Dinner will be ready soon.<br>
<br>
She does not even pretend to react, she simply stares at me without a word.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
What's up, TB?<br>
<br>
......<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Uhh...<br>
<br>
She extends her arms like she expects a hug.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Do you wanna help me cook?<br>
<br>
Yeah...<br>
On one hand, the kitchen is a dangerous place for a young girl. On the other hand, she'll never grow if she doesn't get to do anything.<br>
I bring in a kiddy stool and add some stability to it so she can safely stand on it.<br>
This... round.<br>
She holds up a potato I have yet to dice and makes a gesture I don't quite understand.<br>
Cut in four... simmer with black stuff. Yummy.<br>
I try my best to make sense of what she's trying to say.<br>
Red before thing, chewy... Made my jaw tired.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Oh, do you mean the meat and potatoes stew I made?<br>
<br>
That's my guess at what she means by "red before thing." I messed up and burned it. Maybe she liked it despite that?<br>
She answers with a nod.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Do you want to watch me make it, or do you want to help?<br>
<br>
Help!<br>
There is no change in her tone of voice, but somehow, I can tell that she's excited.<br>
I get out a box of child-sized cooking utensils and hand her a knife.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Just be careful when you're using it.<br>
(It's wild how this house really has everything. Akashi is nothing if not thorough.)<br>
<br>
With TB's help, if you could call it that, the stew came together beautifully.<br>
Picking up a spoon, I scoop up some food and offer to feed her.<br>
However, she ignores the food and instead takes her own cutlery and mimics what I just did, albeit unnaturally.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
They grow up so fast...<br>
No, what am I saying? Get it together, me. You're not a helicopter mom.<br>
<br>
Just as I start to get uncharacteristically emotional from witnessing her growth, I once again feel a tugging on my sleeve.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB：</span><br>
Aaahh.<br>
<br>
TB moves a forkful of broccoli in front of my mouth.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Uhh...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB：</span><br>
Mouth. Open.<br>
<br>
Though she makes no facial expression, she looks very happy.<br>
She's imitating a mother feeding her child. Maybe this feeding behavior is her way of trying to understand something.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB：</span><br>
Aaahh.<br>
<br>
Seeing that I didn't do as she asked, she tries to spur me on again.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Aaahh.<br>
<br>
I open my mouth comically wide and chomp down on the broccoli.<br>
Our fun little mealtime comes to a close not long after.<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=Sweet Dreams|选项=8|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<br>
It has gotten very late.<br>
And yet, TB doesn't seem tired in the slightest.<br>
Don't need bedtime... Not yet.<br>
Her list of memorized words has grown, and it's becoming easier and easier to understand her.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
But you do. You'll never grow up if you don't sleep.<br>
Oh, I know. How about I tuck you in and get you sleepy?<br>
<br>
This is very clearly parent-child stuff... but I'll do it for her sake.<br>
The only question is – what should I do to make her sleepy?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：(Sing a song for her.)</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：(Read a book to her.)</span>'''''<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''A lullaby should do the trick.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''I'll get a picture book and read it to her.<br>
<br>
It didn't take long to lull her to sleep. I took the virtual reality device off and handled some work at the port. After a while, though, a thought started gnawing on me.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I should check on her... Let's go back in and have a look.<br>
<br>
TB must have rolled over in bed a lot, because half of her blanket has slipped off her.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB：</span><br>
Zzzzz...<br>
<br>
Hugging her plushie tightly, she snores quietly and softly.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(I'm curious about that plushie she always has her arms around. What is it even supposed to be?)<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：(Some sort of jellyfish?)</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：(A white rabbit, maybe?)</span>'''''<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''That's what I thought it was at first glance, at least. Now that I look closer, though...<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Yeah, that's definitely not a jellyfish.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''But if it's a rabbit, where is the nose? And why is its body shaped like that?<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''It looks more like some sort of sea creature, though I'm not sure what, exactly.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Whatever it is, it's pretty cute.)<br>
<br>
I adjust the blanket so it fully covers her again.<br>
She doesn't react whatsoever and keeps on sleeping like a baby.<br>
The moonlight shines through the window and pierces the curtains. Looking at TB like this, it feels like I'm seeing her face for the first time.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB：</span><br>
Zzzzz... Mhm...<br>
<br>
I hear a quiet mutter. For a second, I'm not sure if it was TB muttering in her sleep, or if it was the sound of my own breaths.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(I wonder what she's dreaming about...)<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=A New Experience|选项=9|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<br>
I've been helping TB brush her teeth and wash her face for a while, and I think now she's ready to do it on her own.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
TB, do you want to try doing it yourself?<br>
<br>
...Yeah.<br>
After tying her bang up with a hair claw, I put her up on the bathroom chair.<br>
She has a puzzled look on her face, like it's her first time seeing a mirror and sink.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB：</span><br>
There are two me's...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
You mean your reflection? Yeah, there's two of you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB：</span><br>
She looks... different.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
She sure does. The you inside the mirror moves in the opposite way you do.<br>
(I'm starting to talk like her...)<br>
<br>
When you're with a small child like her, something inside you makes you want to speak on the same level as them.<br>
Unlike most kids, though, TB is remarkably well-behaved.<br>
I don't know whether it's because her common knowledge is lacking, or that she views the world differently than most, or if it's because...<br>
Never mind. Thinking hard about it won't yield any answers. What's important is being with her as she grows up.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
There we are. Perfect.<br>
<br>
......<br>
And so, a new day begins.<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=Blue "Water"|选项=10|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<br>
Since TB has slowly accustomed to her normal life, I've decided to bring her to new and different places to expand her knowledge.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
It should be a suitable place for a child her age, but what would that be?<br>
Hmm... Well, you can't go wrong with the aquarium.<br>
<br>
TB and I leisurely roam the aquarium together.<br>
......<br>
She stares blankly at the fish swimming inside the tank.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Not sure what to make of her reaction. Does she like it or dislike it?)<br>
<br>
They're moving.<br>
She approaches the glass of the tank, looks up, and eyes the aquatic life in the water with great curiosity.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Do you like it?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB：</span><br>
Mhm. It's warm.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Not the kind of answer I was expecting... Then again, she's still young, so let's follow up with a question a child can understand.)<br>
Warm? Do you mean these fish?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB：</span><br>
No... The blue water.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
The water? Ohh...<br>
<br>
She must be talking about the sea.<br>
Does she feel a familiarity with it, even inside this fabricated world?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
That's what they call "the sea."<br>
If you like it, we can go to the sea together when you're a little older.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB：</span><br>
Okay...<br>
<br>
She turns to me with a slight look of confusion.<br>
It's understandable. She still has the cognitive ability of a child, so it must be hard for her to truly grasp some concepts.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Do you wanna go over there? There are even bigger fish there.<br>
<br>
She answers with a nod.<br>
TB and I went on to have an unforgettable time together at the aquarium.<br>
Afterward, we called it a day and went home.<br>

<br>
Today is TB's first day of school.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB：</span><br>
I'll be good and listen to the teachers.<br>
<br>
Her use of language has improved considerably compared to what it once was.<br>
However, this fluency makes her distinctive robotic tone stand out all the more.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(It's a little jarring to hear a child speaking in such a monotone voice...)<br>
(Although, that'll probably improve once she finds her own personality.)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB：</span><br>
Hmm?<br>
What's that sound?<br>
<br>
The school bell begins to toll.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
That means school is starting. Bye for now, TB.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB：</span><br>
Bye for now...<br>
<br>
She mimics me and waves goodbye as well.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I'll come pick you up after school.<br>
<br>
The spring breeze is warm and scatters petals from the roadside cherry trees through the air. It almost looks like they're swirling around TB.<br>
I stay and watch as she walks inside the school building and her first day begins.<br>

<br>
Some time has passed since TB started going to school.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Oh, right, they're having an open day at her school, and there will be a performance.)<br>
(Is she going to put on a performance, too?)<br>
Hmm... I guess I just have to wait and see. Whatever the case, it's time to go pick her up.<br>
<br>
TB and I are walking home together, and for some reason, she glances up at me from time to time.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Did something happen today?<br>
<br>
I squat down to meet TB at eye level.<br>
......<br>
We're doing a performance for the open day.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Right. Are you doing one, too?<br>
<br>
She responds with a nod.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(I had a hunch. This just confirms it.)<br>
<br>
The teacher said I'll need a costume for it.<br>
Directions vague. I don't know what to do.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Why not just go with something cute? That seems right for a performance.<br>
(I didn't really think that answer through... Hope it's fine, though.)<br>
(If I'd known this was what I'd deal with, I would've read up on child psychology.)<br>
<br>
Okay.<br>
Once we return home, I rummage through the closet and pick out a few garments that would look cute on her.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB：</span><br>
Do I... look cute?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Absolutely.<br>
<br>
She silently examines herself in the mirror. She seems to like this dress quite a lot.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
You've... grown.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB：</span><br>
I have? Yeah. And I'm gonna get even bigger.<br>
<br>
Her eyes are glued stuck to the mirror even while she responds.<br>
While she still isn't using clear facial expressions, she has become easier to read.<br>
I cannot wait to see what kind of performance she's going to give.<br>

<br>
I take off the device, leaving the virtual world and returning to my office.<br>
It's funny how TB's and my roles have reversed somewhat. She ordinarily assists me in the real world, while in her world, my job is to supervise her as she matures.<br>
As I ruminate on the oddity of it, there is a knock on the door.<br>
It swings open, and inside steps a familiar green shopkeeper.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Akashi? What brings you here?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
Heheh. See, there's a feature I forgot to tell you about, nya.<br>
The virtual world will update at regular intervals based on the actions of its residents, nya.<br>
Which is to say, whenever there's a new version, TB will experience a growth spurt, nya.<br>
<br>
Checking the device, I find a gauge on it that tracks the progress until the next update.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I already knew she'd grow, but not that there'd be an indicator for it. You could've told me sooner.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
People forget things, nya. Now let's give TB that update, nya.<br>
She'll have grown a lot by the next time you see her, nya.<br>
Also... Hmm, actually, that's it in terms of features I should tell you about, nya. Catch you later, nya!<br>
<br>
Then, Akashi vanishes in the twinkle of an eye.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
She sure is good at running away...<br>
<br>
Now I'm curious to see what Akashi means by "growth spurt."<br>
I have to ask myself an important question – what is TB to me, anyway?<br>
Just an AI assistant? Or is she more than that?<br>
The question simmers in my mind for a while until I realize I have no answer to it.<br>
Spending more time with her is the only way I'm going to find that answer.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
The update should be done by now. Time to put it back on and check on her.<br>
<br>
A jingle plays to signify the update's completion. I switch the device on and dive back into the virtual world.<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=A New Mode of Interaction|选项=14|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<br>
It has been a while since that system update.<br>
If TB was around 3 or 4 years old before the update, I would say she is about 7 or 8 now.<br>
She sees growth, in every meaning of the word, as a good thing – and she certainly has grown.<br>
It's time to leave. Judging by the traffic conditions and the weather, there's about a 10% chance I'll be late.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
You're taking this awfully seriously. You could be a little more lax, you know. Nobody's going to kill you for being late.<br>
<br>
I think this is just what's expected of a "good girl."<br>
Sports day starts in an hour. I need to set off now.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
......<br>
<br>
I let out a sigh under my breath.<br>
As soon as we arrive at the school, she changes uniforms all by herself.<br>
She then begins the warmup exercises on the mat laid out on the school track.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Hey, TB. I'll leave a bottle of water and some towels here for you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB：</span><br>
M'kay. Are you going home already?<br>
<br>
She shoots me the question whilst performing leg and back stretches.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
No, I'll still be here, cheering you on from the bleachers over there.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB：</span><br>
......<br>
<br>
Oddly, she looks a little displeased to hear this.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
It's not against the rules, is it? Assuming it's fine, I'll be right there, rooting for you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB：</span><br>
Okay. I'll try to do good so I'll get good grades.<br>
<br>
Maybe I'm just imagining it, but it looks like the corners of her mouth rise slightly. She has never made an expression before this point.<br>
Seems I'm dealing with a kid with a small rebellious streak. Still, rebelliousness is cute in its own way.<br>

<br>
It's just another day. Or, maybe a little more than "just."<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
500!<br>
<br>
No, 800.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
648, no more.<br>
<br>
At least 999!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Hang on, that's MORE than you just asked for.<br>
<br>
The teacher called it "haggling." She said it's a way to squeeze money out of people.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
That's not "haggling" you're doing. It's called, "asking for more and more pocket money for your school trip."<br>
<br>
Hmph.<br>
TB puffs her cheeks with indignation and falls silent, thinking about something.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB：</span><br>
...Can't you give me more, nya? Even just a teensy-weensy bit, nya?<br>
<br>
She looks almost ready to start crying. It's tugging on my heartstrings something fierce.<br>
That word at the end of her sentences, though...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB：</span><br>
The teacher said, "Use this word when your guardian won't do as you ask, nya."<br>
<br>
She grabs my sleeve and tugs on it while she pleads.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB：</span><br>
Please give me more, nya...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Okay, okay. Your begging strategy worked. You win.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB：</span><br>
I win, nya!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
......<br>
<br>
Oh boy... Akashi has some explaining to do.<br>
Because this is NOT the kind of stuff you should be teaching a kid!<br>

<br>
There is a festival in town, and TB and I are having a look around.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Look at that. You've grown again.<br>
<br>
That's to be expected when I'm in my growth period. My teacher said so.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Not what I was hoping to hear, but alright...<br>
<br>
Umm... Okay.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I just thought you'd be happy to hear someone close to you point out how you've grown.<br>
<br>
TB looks at me over her shoulder while fireworks in dazzling colors fill the night sky.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB：</span><br>
I am happy.<br>
<br>
There it is. The expression on her face is what you could definitively call a smile.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB：</span><br>
We did a lot of fun things and even saw fireworks tonight. Of course I'm happy.<br>
<br>
The words themselves don't sound right for a girl her age, but that's beside the point.<br>
What matters is that she has developed her own feelings, which may mean this project has been partially successful thus far.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB：</span><br>
I wish it was fireworks day every day.<br>
Then I wouldn't have to go to school.<br>
<br>
Now she sounds like a kid again. Hearing that, I can't help but smile.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
That's no good, TB. You have to go to school if you want to be a good girl.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB：</span><br>
Oh...<br>
<br>
She sounds a bit disappointed to hear that.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB：</span><br>
What about the next time it's fireworks day? Can we go then?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Of course we can.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB：</span><br>
Pinky promise?<br>
<br>
I hook my pinky finger around hers, vowing that we'll come here again next summer.<br>

<br>
The school is hosting a camping trip for the students, which of course includes TB.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
That's enough snacks for the trip. Now just to figure out what to do about your lunch.<br>
<br>
My lunch?<br>
I wanna make it myself.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
No. You'll hurt yourself.<br>
<br>
She certainly has grown, but she's still too young to be left alone in a place with gas flames and sharp knives.<br>
But you let me help that one time!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Yeah, but...<br>
<br>
She has a point, actually. I let her do it once when she was younger, and she's only grown since then.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Alright, alright. Let's start with frying an egg.<br>
<br>
40 minutes later...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB：</span><br>
Hey... How come the egg always burns when I try to fry it?<br>
<br>
Shaking the pan, she shoots me a confused look. The surface of the still-soft yolk breaks and the inside spills out everywhere.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB：</span><br>
I'm doing it EXACTLY like you showed me...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
It's the oil. You're heating it too much. Also, you're tossing the pan too soon.<br>
<br>
She gives a sideways glance to the plate of failed previous attempts and a look of hopelessness creeps through on her face.<br>
I taught her how to do it in detail and took precautions so she wouldn't hurt herself...<br>
Even so, she's at risk of being burned by the fire and the drops of sizzling oil flying everywhere, which she doesn't seem to fear in the least. I'm worried that her sense of danger may be underdeveloped.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
*sigh*...<br>
<br>
Determined not to let food go to waste, TB ate all the fried eggs she burned over her many attempts.<br>
I think she won't want to even hear the word "egg" for a while.<br>

<br>
TB's school entrance examination is coming up soon.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(I should ask how her studies are going. Just to be sure she's doing alright.)<br>
<br>
I walk over to her room and she lets me inside.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB：</span><br>
Um...<br>
I have no idea what stuff I'm supposed to go over.<br>
I've read tons of books, but I forget everything in them.<br>
My teachers say I'm great at some subjects, but that's not enough because my other subjects are too far behind.<br>
<br>
Seeing the grades on the tests on her desk, a chuckle escapes my lips.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB：</span><br>
It's NOT funny.<br>
<br>
She pouts.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I'm just amazed that your grades are behind. How do I put it...<br>
<br>
I had assumed TB could do anything and everything. I never thought she'd get bad grades in certain subjects.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Sorry, you're right. I shouldn't laugh.<br>
Let's review those subjects you're not so good at, shall we?<br>

{{折叠面板|标题=Another System Upgrade|选项=19|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<br>
The device should have collected plenty of data by now. It's time for a system update.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Look who's here again. Don't tell me there's ANOTHER important feature you forgot to bring up.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
You hit the nail on the head, nya.<br>
It's time to tell you about the thing that defines this whole project, nya. Namely, the personality TB is about to develop, nya.<br>
After this upgrade, you will see a TB with more evident personality traits, nya.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Isn't it too early for her? I thought it'd be a more slow and steady process...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
We ARE doing things step by step, nya!<br>
Oh, also... her personality will influence her choice of occupation in the future, nya.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Hang on, she's going to get a job?<br>
I don't remember that being on the list of things I asked for.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
It's realistic for her to get a job when she's old enough, nya. I hope you understand, nya.<br>
Regardless of how you feel, just know that I've officially told you everything now, nya. Good luck with TB, nya.<br>
<br>
She swiftly vanishes from sight again.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
*sigh*... So she says, but I still feel like there's something she's keeping from me.<br>
...Oh, looks like the update is done.<br>
Let's head back in and see what's changed.<br>

{{折叠面板|标题=Amusement Park and Commemoration - Part 1|选项=20|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<br>
TB and I are visiting the amusement park.<br>
Whereas I'm in pretty high spirits, she isn't showing much emotion of any kind.<br>
It reminds me of... How do I put it?<br>
It feels like she has reverted to the TB I'm used to working with.<br>
You appear to be distracted.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Not really. I was just thinking about what ride we should go on.<br>
<br>
Okay. What are your ideas?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
How about the roller coaster?<br>
<br>
No thanks.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Okay. The log flume, then?<br>
<br>
I don't want to get wet.<br>
So she doesn't want to go on any of the popular rides.<br>
That leaves not many options, but there's always...<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：(The merry-go-round.)</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：(The UFO!)</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''How does the merry-go-round sound?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''......<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''She isn't opposed to it, at least.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Merry-go-round it is, then. Let's get in line.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''...No, she definitely doesn't want to ride that.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''I'll earn her ire if I suggest any more thrill rides to her.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''A gentle ride should be more to her tastes.<br>
<br>
We line up at the entrance to the merry-go-round.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
These seats look pretty cramped for adults...<br>
<br>
That's no surprise, since it's clearly themed with children in mind. I crack a wry smile.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
You go ahead and enjoy yourself. I'll sit this one out.<br>
<br>
No thanks.<br>
There's room for one person per horse.<br>
Although her tone remains as unaffected and flat as ever, she projects an air of intensity that I can't refuse.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Alright, alright. I'll get on.<br>
<br>
I take a seat on the wooden horse just next to hers.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Hey, TB, look here.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB：</span><br>
Hm?<br>
<br>
I snap a picture of her riding the merry-go-round.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB：</span><br>
Please at least tell me before you photograph me.<br>
Then again... No, never mind.<br>
This is fine.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Huh...?<br>
<br>
She doesn't say a word after that, but she does nudge me into riding the merry-go-round again later.<br>
Our amusement park visit continues after that, and we make some unforgettable memories.<br>

<br>
Today, TB and I are going to the amusement park.<br>
Just looking at her and seeing how much she has changed makes me question if what I'm seeing is real or not.<br>
I got us some snacks and drinks. Just let me know when you want a bite or a sip.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
That's so thoughtful of you... You've really grown into a fine adult.<br>
<br>
Heehee. Listen to you. You sound like an old lady speaking to her grandchild.<br>
Remember where we are? That's right, the amusement park. Let's go enjoy ourselves already, shall we?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Right, yeah.<br>
<br>
Oops. I got distracted.<br>
So, what attraction would you like to go on first?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Ask yourself that. We're here for YOU to have fun.<br>
<br>
Well, if you're sure...<br>
Then how about the merry-go-round?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
The merry-go-round?<br>
<br>
Oh... You don't think that's a childish ride, do you?<br>
She looks down at the ground, feeling embarrassed for suggesting it.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
No, not at all. I was just surprised. It's a cute choice.<br>
<br>
I would've never imagined the TB I know simply coming forward and saying, "I want to ride the merry-go-round."<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Alright, let's go. To the merry-go-round!<br>
<br>
I take a seat on the wooden horse just next to hers.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Hey, TB, look here.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB：</span><br>
Okay!<br>
<br>
She extends her hand towards the camera.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB：</span><br>
Make sure I'm in focus!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Of course.<br>
<br>
The camera shutter clicks, and I snap a photograph of her.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB：</span><br>
Heehee. When we're home again, you should print out all the photos we take today.<br>
<br>
Our amusement park visit continues after that, and we make some unforgettable memories.<br>

Take it easy, TB... We don't need to run everywhere...<br>

See? This is what happens when you don't exercise on the regular!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
But I do! I'm only out of breath because we just got off the roller coaster!<br>
<br>
Yet you've still got the energy to argue! Hahah!<br>
Anyway, what's next? How about the log flume? I've been waiting to ride that all day now!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Can't we go on something less... intense? Like a gentle ride?<br>
<br>
Fiiine. Let me think...<br>
While she thinks to herself, I plant myself on a roadside bench to recover from the jitters the roller coaster gave me.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
It floors me how much pep you have... You've sure changed from your younger self.<br>
<br>
Hm? What'd you say?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Oh, nothing. Just wondering if you've settled on the next attraction.<br>
<br>
Yeah, I know just the right one! The merry-go-round!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB：</span><br>
Am I in focus? Great! Make sure you capture my best side!<br>
<br>
The moment we get on the merry-go-round, TB hands me her smartphone and asks me to snap a photograph.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Since when were you so keen on taking pictures?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB：</span><br>
I'm not, like, a photo nerd or anything! This is just a special occasion that deserves to be immortalized!<br>
I mean, when was the last time we went on the merry-go-round? Basically never! Heehee!<br>
<br>
She smiles a joyful smile.<br>
It's pretty cramped for me as an adult on a merry-go-round for children. I wonder if she thinks it's funny how out-of-place I am.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Maybe so, but I can live with it if she's having fun.)<br>
<br>
The camera shutter clicks, and I snap a photograph of her.<br>
Our amusement park visit continues after that, and we make some unforgettable memories.<br>

<br>
Winter has arrived in the virtual town.<br>
It's snowing outside.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
And wouldn't you know it, it's Christmas today. Talk about lucky.<br>
<br>
How is it lucky?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Don't you think it's a good omen when the first snow falls on Christmas?<br>
<br>
I'm not sure how to feel about it.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Dang. I'm sure you'd feel the Christmas spirit if I'd hung up decorations around the house. If only I'd had time...<br>
Oh, I know. What do you say we go buy some decorations and spruce the place up?<br>
<br>
Sure. If you say so.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Alright, this looks good.<br>
<br>
The manjuus have finished decorating the Christmas tree. I examine it while I put some wood in the fireplace.<br>
TB bought a Christmas dress, if memory serves me right. She should be done getting changed any minute now.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
TB, everything's done! You wanna come have a look?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB：</span><br>
Okay.<br>
While I was buying my dress, I also asked for this from the shop clerk.<br>
<br>
A beautifully wrapped Christmas present rests in her hands.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB：</span><br>
I saved up my allowance to buy it.<br>
<br>
She seems shy as she looks to the side while saying that.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB：</span><br>
I was... feeling the Christmas spirit.<br>
It was then that I understood what you meant by "lucky."<br>
Merry Christmas.<br>
This is for you.<br>
<br>
The fireplace crackles and pops, and a faint, rosy blush forms on her ordinarily pale and neutral face.<br>
It's a warm Christmas, and TB and I celebrate it together.<br>

<br>
Winter has arrived in the virtual town.<br>
It's started to snow outside.<br>
How fitting that the first snow would be on Christmas. It sets such a wonderful mood.<br>
What do you say we put up some decorations around the house?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Oh, it totally escaped my memory that Christmas was coming up. We don't have any Christmas stuff ready...<br>
<br>
Heehee. Don't you worry.<br>
I've already ordered everything we'll need. The manjuus will deliver a Christmas tree right to our doorstep in 20 minutes.<br>
You've always treated me so well, and I wanted to repay you for that somehow...<br>
Which is why I planned out everything today. You won't need to lift a finger!<br>
It's exactly as she said. She planned everything so thoroughly that there's nothing I even can help with.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Her thoughtfulness delights me, of course, but this really is next-level. It's almost intimidating...)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB：</span><br>
I have a surprise for you, by the way.<br>
<br>
While I ruminate on things, TB suddenly speaks up from behind me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB：</span><br>
Come on! Turn around!<br>
I bought this Christmas outfit because I felt like going extra festive tonight.<br>
Feast your eyes, because TB Claus is only in town for one night. And she has a present for you!<br>
<br>
She holds out the wrapped Christmas present to me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB：</span><br>
This is my thank-you for always looking after me.<br>
It's not much, I know, but it's the thought that counts, right?<br>
I hope you'll appreciate it.<br>
Merry Christmas.<br>
<br>
It's a warm Christmas, and TB and I celebrate it together.<br>

<br>
Winter has arrived in the virtual town.<br>
Look! It's snowing!<br>
Can you believe it's snowing, right on Christmas? If that ain't a good omen, I dunno what is!<br>
TB is glued to the window. Her eyes in the reflection glitter like stars.<br>
But we haven't put up the Christmas decorations yet... Time is running short! Let's go out and buy them, now!<br>
I don't even have time to respond before she grabs me by the hand and drags me outside.<br>
When we return home, I barely have the strength left to even shuffle over to the couch and sink into it.<br>
TB, meanwhile, is zipping and zooming around the house, putting up decorations here and there. It's like that whole outing didn't drain a drop of her energy.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Four hours... Four whole hours spent running around without a minute to rest...<br>
And you're not tired in the slightest...?<br>
<br>
Do I LOOK tired? I told you you need to exercise more! This is what happens when you skip leg day!<br>
I'll make the place look nice and festive. You just stay there and rest, okay?<br>
With speed and moxie, she once more makes off like the wind into another room to decorate.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I do desperately need to rest, but I'll doze off if I sit here for too long...<br>
<br>
Wake up. Hey, wake up.<br>
I said wake up!<br>
Still half-asleep and out of it, I hear TB calling out to me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB：</span><br>
Tadah! TB Claus is here in style!<br>
Heehee. What do you think? Don't I look Christmassy as anything?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(She's all but begging for compliments.)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB：</span><br>
This is for you!<br>
<br>
She presents a small box, lovingly wrapped and tied up in a nice bow.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB：</span><br>
The decorations and stuff basically cost my whole allowance, so this was all I could afford.<br>
But I spent what was left very wisely! It's not the most lavish gift, but that doesn't mean there's not a lot of thought behind it!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Of course. I appreciate any gift I get from you, TB Claus.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB：</span><br>
Heheh! That's what I want to hear!<br>
Merry Christmas!<br>
<br>
It's a lively Christmas, and TB and I celebrate it together.<br>

<br>
We won tickets to a hot spring resort weekend through a raffle, and since it's the cold season, TB and I immediately set off.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Whew... This is heaven.<br>
<br>
......<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Is something the matter, TB?<br>
<br>
It's really hot...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB：</span><br>
It's really hot...<br>
<br>
She pulls on the towel covering her chest in a vain attempt to vent some steam and cool herself down.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Do you want to try a different hot spring?<br>
We'll just get up if it's too uncomfortable for you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB：</span><br>
You must really like hot springs.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I guess? There's also that this is the best season for a hot bath.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB：</span><br>
Alright... I'll bear with it for now, then.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Oh. She's putting up with it for my sake...)<br>
Oh, man... I think the heat is getting to my head.<br>
It's time to get up and have some cold milk!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB：</span><br>
Okay.<br>
<br>
And so, we have a pleasant stay at the hot spring resort.<br>

<br>
We won tickets to a hot spring resort weekend through a raffle, and since it's the cold season, TB and I immediately set off.<br>
I'm so glad I get to go on this vacation with you.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
It wouldn't have happened without you, that's for sure.<br>
<br>
The tickets were the jackpot prize, and she won it on the first try. I wish I had a sliver of her luck.<br>
Heehee...<br>
Her lips curve into a somewhat timid smile.<br>
Mere moments later, though, that gentle look turns into a flustered expression.<br>
Oh! Oh gosh!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB：</span><br>
Oh! Oh gosh!<br>
My towel is slipping off!<br>
<br>
She is sitting right next to the hot spring's tap, so maybe the flow of hot water made the towel sag.<br>
At any rate, the tightly-wrapped towel suddenly comes undone and falls down limply.<br>
With haste, she clutches the towel to cover herself up... but it's not enough.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB：</span><br>
Pl-please don't stare!<br>
Oh, goodness, this is so embarrassing...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Ahem... I'm, uh, feeling a little lightheaded, so I'm going to get up.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB：</span><br>
Okay...<br>
<br>
We go on to pretend like that never happened and enjoy the rest of our stay at the hot spring resort.<br>

<br>
We won tickets to a hot spring resort weekend through a raffle, and since it's the cold season, TB and I immediately set off.<br>
Ohh, baby! I love hot springs!<br>
You know what else I love? This! Ka-splash!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Hey! You can't just splash water on people like that.<br>
<br>
Why not? It's fun.<br>
There's no rule against it, and even if there was, we have the whole place to ourselves.<br>
Let's have a little fun! Come on!<br>
Seeing her eyes twinkle with excitement, I breathe an exasperated sigh.<br>
It is completely beyond me how she turned into such an over-the-top peppy girl.<br>
Hm? What's that?<br>
Just as I brace myself for a hot spring water fight, something else seems to grab her attention.<br>
Look! It's a maple leaf!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB：</span><br>
Look! It's a maple leaf!<br>
<br>
A leaf floats in the water. She picks it up and covers her eye with it, showing it to me.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
It is. What about it?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB：</span><br>
In cases like this, you need to have a quote prepared. Like...<br>
"Cursed power within my right eye, heed my words – with this leaf made of a sage's blood, I will seal you away!"<br>
Ain't that the coolest thing you've ever heard? I read it in a comic book!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Sure, it's cool. If you're a teenager in their edgy phase.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB：</span><br>
Hmph. Spoken like the most boring adult on the planet.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Oh, I'm boring? Let's see how you fare against this cursed power of mine!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB：</span><br>
Owch! Hot, hot!<br>
<br>
And so, we have a fun stay at the hot spring resort.<br>

Today is the day of TB's graduation party.<br>
After adjusting my clothes one last time, I head to the spot where she's waiting for me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB：</span><br>
...You're late.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Yeah, sorry about that.<br>
I can't afford to look sloppy at your graduation party, so I double and triple-checked my outfit, which took some time.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB：</span><br>
It's okay. I didn't wait too long, anyway.<br>
Just so you know... I don't wear a dress like this every day, so...<br>
I'd appreciate it if you wouldn't stare.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
How come?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB：</span><br>
I dunno. It just feels like I stick out like a sore thumb. I'm not comfortable in it.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
You don't stick out at all. You look gorgeous in it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB：</span><br>
...You mean it?<br>
Then it's not so bad.<br>
<br>
Gentle music flows through the ballroom. I make a small bow to TB, inviting her to dance with me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB：</span><br>
......<br>
<br>
She softly places her hand on my palm.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Congratulations on your graduation, TB.<br>

Today is the day of TB's graduation party.<br>
After adjusting my clothes one last time, I head to the spot where she's waiting for me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB：</span><br>
You're here. I'm glad you could come.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Sorry for being late. Hope you didn't have to wait for too long.<br>
I can't afford to look sloppy at your graduation party, so I double and triple-checked my outfit, which took some time.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB：</span><br>
I appreciate your attention to the little things like that.<br>
<br>
She pinches the side of her dress and raises it with one hand before extending her other one to me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB：</span><br>
Would you like to dance with me?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Hey, now, that's MY line.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB：</span><br>
Heehee. Perhaps so, but I said it first!<br>
The ball will start any minute now. Come on, we'll be late if we don't get moving.<br>
<br>
I take her hand. It feels soft and warm.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Congratulations on your graduation, TB.<br>

<br>
Today is the day of TB's graduation party.<br>
After adjusting my clothes one last time, I head to the spot where she's waiting for me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB：</span><br>
How is my dress? Isn't it jaw-droppingly beautiful, elegant, and tasteful?<br>
I spent so, so long picking out just the right one, so it better be!<br>
<br>
She shoots me a gaze and then performs a quick pirouette.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
You bet. It's the perfect dress for you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB：</span><br>
Heheh! Obviously!<br>
By the way, you're gonna have to dance all night with me to make up for being so darn late!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Yeah, sorry about that.<br>
I can't afford to look sloppy at your graduation party, so I double and triple-checked my outfit, which took some time.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB：</span><br>
What? THAT'S why you ran late? Fine, I can forgive that!<br>
Oh, look! The ballroom is opening! Let's get a move on!<br>
Gimme your hand!<br>
<br>
I can't even get a word in before she grabs my hand and starts sprinting off with me into the ballroom.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Easy, cowgirl. Slow down...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB：</span><br>
Heehee! Nope!<br>
<br>
Just as I try to say, "Congratulations on your graduation, TB," she smiles a smile so bright that it drowns out my words.<br>

{{折叠面板|标题=The Path Towards Future|选项=32|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<br>
At this point, the project's primary goal of cultivating a personality for TB has been achieved.<br>
In the second stage, TB will have chosen a career based on how I raised her, according to Akashi.<br>
I wonder what she's like now that she's grown even more.<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=Busy Fashion Model|选项=33|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB：</span><br>
...How is this expression and pose? Fine?<br>
<br>
With her beautiful looks and talent in front of the camera, TB became a model after graduating.<br>
Meanwhile, I more or less became her half-agent, and I handle the contracts and business side of things.<br>
If you're wondering why I'm only half an agent...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB：</span><br>
I have another commercial shoot in three hours, so let me know about the progress, thanks.<br>
There's an audition in the morning tomorrow, then in the evening... Actually, please cancel my gig in the evening tomorrow.<br>
<br>
...It's because she can manage her schedule completely fine without an agent's help.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
That there is a great pose.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB：</span><br>
The gig can wait, because I want to go to the amusement park with you tomorrow.<br>
...Also, what's so great about it? There's nothing good about it at all.<br>
<br>
She whispers to me between takes. There, in that moment while she was changing poses, I caught a glimpse of her cheeks turning faintly red.<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB：</span><br>
...Hm? It's bad for the eyes?<br>
Don't worry about it. I adjusted to it a long time ago.<br>
<br>
Post-graduation, TB committed herself to the art of painting.<br>
She moved out and found a studio apartment. There, she spends day and night refining her craft.<br>
Because of the distance between us, we mostly communicate via phone.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Remember, you need to eat. Is that clear?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB：</span><br>
Yeah, I know. I'll be coming over to your house today.<br>
So... please make something tasty.<br>
<br>
She whispers a promise to me.<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB：</span><br>
...Okay, need to set everything up before the band gets here.<br>
<br>
After graduating, TB became a musician and put together enough money to purchase her own recording studio.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
That must be exhausting.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB：</span><br>
Yeah. I guess it's the price you pay for making music that really speaks to the soul.<br>
You can wait outside if you're getting bored, by the way.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Not at all. It's fun watching you work.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB：</span><br>
M'kay.<br>
<br>
The look on her face as she fiddles with the mixer is one of utmost concentration.<br>
When I get home, I should listen to some of the albums she recommended.<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB：</span><br>
First, I'd like to thank all my wonderful fans. Your support has honestly been stunning.<br>
This comes as such a surprise to me that I don't even have a speech prepared...<br>
<br>
TB stands on stage, trophy in hand, addressing an entire audience of people.<br>
She became an actor after graduating. Celebrated for her outstanding talent, she has received numerous awards and prizes.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB：</span><br>
...But I will say this – I wouldn't have gotten into acting, and I certainly wouldn't have received this trophy, if it weren't for the person who raised me.<br>
<br>
She smiles warmly. Everything around her seems to pale in comparison to the light she gives off.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB：</span><br>
To that person, and to everyone else who has supported me, thank you.<br>

Spreading icing on a cake evenly has no right being this difficult...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB：</span><br>
Heehee. It takes patience to make a cake look beautiful.<br>
<br>
After graduating, TB turned her hobby into her job.<br>
This and that happened, and now she's a fairly well-known chef.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB：</span><br>
Of course, it's no piece of cake to bake a pretty cake when you're a beginner... Let me tell you a little lifehack.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
There's a lifehack?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB：</span><br>
Absolutely. It's to pour your heart into what you're making. Then it becomes easy.<br>
Like this...<br>
<br>
As she moves, a sweet aroma of cream and strawberry fills the kitchen.<br>
The cake she's making will is going to be delicious.<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB：</span><br>
Oh... You're here.<br>
<br>
After she graduated, TB chose to become a writer.<br>
The novels she published all garnered great reviews, and so she decided to make writing into her full-time job.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB：</span><br>
As you can see, I'm searching for inspiration at the moment.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Have you already settled on the theme for your next book?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB：</span><br>
More or less. I want to do a romance story next.<br>
You'll help me gather some references, won't you?<br>
<br>
There is a tinge of teasing suggestiveness in her tone as she says that.<br>

{{折叠面板|标题=Amazing Athlete|选项=39|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB：</span><br>
Heehee! First place again!<br>
<br>
TB clutches a towel with one hand and gestures a peace sign at me with the other.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB：</span><br>
Aren't I super? Amazing, even? The best ever, even?<br>
Securing even bigger trophies will be a breeze if I keep this momentum up!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Right...<br>
<br>
Following her graduation, she became an athlete to take advantage of her physical abilities.<br>
She is on course to achieve even greater athletic feats in the world at large.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Remember, eyes on the prize. You don't want to get complacent.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB：</span><br>
Of course! You just wait and see!<br>

{{折叠面板|标题=Big Shot Businesswoman|选项=40|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB：</span><br>
Your business is booming and it's clear that you don't need any associates.<br>
And yet, you've come to me for help, but won't show me any respect or even address me as "ma'am." Do you expect that to work for you?<br>
<br>
TB has become a big shot in the business world and projects a staggeringly intimidating aura.<br>
After graduating, she set her sights on bringing home her own bacon.<br>
She started at the bottom by working part-time at a store, then climbed the ladder step by step until she became a rising star in finance.<br>
Seeing the stately manner she presents herself, it feels almost like she has changed into another person entirely.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB：</span><br>
Whew... I finally got them out of my hair!<br>
Why are you looking at me like that? You won't get leeches like those people off your tail if you don't play tough!<br>
Ugh. Being at the top isn't all it's cracked up to be. Working sucks! I just wanna visit the hot springs with you again!<br>
<br>
She bursts into a whining fit.<br>
Inside, she is still her old self. Thank goodness for that.<br>

{{折叠面板|标题=Lively Farm Owner|选项=41|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB：</span><br>
Tadaaah! Look at all this! I'm running the place pretty well, wouldn'tcha say?<br>
It's exhausting work day in and day out, but it's more fulfilling and fun than any other job out there!<br>
<br>
After graduating, TB yearned for a very different lifestyle, and so she took over a farm.<br>
The farm had been in decline for some time, but she slowly turned it around with hard, honest work. It's now more prosperous than ever.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB：</span><br>
Hey, think you could help out with a few things? It's a good workout and builds muscle, too.<br>
Oh, I'll pay you for the trouble, of course!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
No need to pay me. I'll help anyway.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB：</span><br>
Heheh. Alright, then be a dear and feed ol' Daisy here.<br>
<br>
Her ponytail flutters for a little as a calm breeze blows by.<br>
What wonderful weather we're having today.<br>

{{折叠面板|标题=Repetitive Everyday|选项=42|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<br>
TB graduated with no particular hobbies or remarkable skills. She took a back seat and simply drifted wherever life took her.<br>
Now she works a run-of-the-mill, unremarkable office job.<br>
A ceaseless stream of phone calls, a paperwork stack with no end in sight, and long, late-night overtime shifts that leave bags under the eyes...<br>
If she got a second chance, maybe she wouldn't have to live such an exhausting life.<br>

{{折叠面板|标题=Shut-In Life|选项=43|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<br>
My parenting attitude of live and let live proved too lenient, resulting in TB losing interest in everything.<br>
After graduating, she chose a life of doing absolutely nothing.<br>
All she needs to be content are video games, soda, and fried chicken.<br>
It's dubious that she will even set foot outside her room again.<br>

{{折叠面板|标题=End of the Search for "Personality"|选项=44|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Is... that it? It's over?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
It is, nya!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Akashi?! What are you doing here?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
Myahaha... Any developer worth their salt knows to leave a backdoor in, nya!<br>
Also, TB wants to tell you something, so I brought her along, nya.<br>
And in case you're wondering how TB can be here – it's a trade secret, so don't ask, nya.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Damn, she answered all my questions before I could even ask them.)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
I'd better get going now, nya. You two have a nice chat, nya!<br>
<br>
After Akashi walks off, I turn my gaze to TB, who stands there silently.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB ：</span><br>
Synchronizing analysis module. Commander, I have analyzed the data gathered from the virtual town.<br>
I have found that there is a connection between upbringing and the development of a personality.<br>
However, it is impossible to train on the data gained from one instance alone. Additional data is needed.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
And the way to get that training data is by repeating the simulation, right?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB ：</span><br>
Correct.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
But then won't your personality reset if I start over from the very beginning? Do you really want that?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB ：</span><br>
Conclusion: Personality resets within the simulated space do not affect me.<br>
The data will be saved at the end of each simulation, just as with this simulation.<br>
It is possible this next statement is influenced by the concepts relating to emotional cognition, but regardless...<br>
If possible, I wish to spend more time with you, Commander.<br>
Synchronizing analysis module. Based on logged data, the most fitting words to conclude this conversation with are as follows...<br>
Thank you for everything. I hope to see you in another iteration.<br>
