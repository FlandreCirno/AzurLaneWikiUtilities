<br>
Somewhere, in an unknown location...<br>
When I open my eyes, I'm met with an endless expanse of blue.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Wait... "Open my eyes"?)<br>
(I'm pretty sure I was sleeping just a moment ago...)<br>
(This must be a dream, then.)<br>
<br>
When I realize this, my surroundings also begin to warp around me. Familiar images and voices start to play in my head.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Really? Shouldn't you hold on to it?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I'm sure it'll serve you well one day.<br>
Now, I think it's time I be on my way.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
This compass is the real treasure. You get it for overcoming the trial of the ruins.<br>
Heheh, though I'm the one who handled the trial!<br>
Either way, it'll help you out someday. Keep it safe!<br>
<br>
The strange compass.<br>
It's the object that led me to Royal Fortune and what joined our destinies together.<br>
And now, it has appeared in this dreamscape, glowing faintly as it casts its light in a certain direction.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：(Follow the compass.)</span>'''''<br>
<br>
The light grows brighter and brighter until eventually, it engulfs everything.<br>
Then, a sea ravaged by strong gales. The compass and the light have disappeared from my hand.<br>
I'm standing on a boat that creaks as it bobs up and down on the waves. The words stop in my throat.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Is this another dream?)<br>
<br>
Fierce winds shriek like specters while a briny downpour pelts my skin.<br>
As a commander, it is a feeling I know all too well – I am in the middle of a storm.<br>
(That salty smell, the feel of the raindrops... It's all too vivid. Is this real?)<br>
(Did the compass bring me back to Tempesta's branch again?)<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(If that's what happened, this is really bad!)<br>
<br>
My attention goes back to the ship I'm standing on.<br>
It's far too fragile to withstand this storm and could break apart any second now.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Dammit... I need to get out of this storm and find land immediately!)<br>
(Obviously, there's no way I'll find land smack-dab in the middle of the ocean, but...)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Ahoy! Commander!<br>
That IS you, right?<br>
<br>
As I survey my surroundings in a daze, I suddenly hear a familiar, friendly voice.<br>
The next moment, a massive ship breaks through the downpour and appears before me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Blimey! It IS you!<br>
What are you doing in this storm? How'd you even get here?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
You tell me...<br>
Also, this is a bad time for questions. My ship is about to sink!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Oh, crap!<br>
Hang in there! I'll rescue you!<br>

<br>
Through some miracle, I manage to board Royal Fortune's vessel.<br>
Seeing my battered ship sink below the waves, I breathe a sigh of relief.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
I've missed you, Commander!<br>
<br>
Royal Fortune comes running up to me with open arms. Before I know it, I find myself squished into her bosom.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：It's been a while.</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Yeah! It really has!<br>
How come you knew I was out here?<br>
Is it because I summoned all of Tempesta?<br>
Which included you, I guess?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Wait, you did what?<br>
You called them to the middle of a storm?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
A storm is nothing we can't handle! It's in our name!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
......<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
It was a joke! Don't look at me all angry like that!<br>
Actually, this place was pretty calm up until a few moments ago. Then this storm showed up out of nowhere.<br>
Maybe the storm appeared because you showed up?<br>
Speaking of which, how'd you end up here anyway? I'd love to think that you're at my beck and call, but...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I saw a compass in my dream, and followed it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
A compass? You mean the one you gave me, and then I gave back to you?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
No, the one you gave to me and that I later gave to you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
What? But I don't have a compass. I gave mine to you, remember?<br>
You said you saw it in your dreams... Does that mean you don't have it on you?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Like I just said, I gave it to you!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Oookay... So where is it now?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Good question.</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：Your guess is as good as mine.</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Welp, I guess only god knows now...<br>
But you see, the thing about lost items is that they tend to crop up when you least expect it! Like how it showed up in your dreams.<br>
On another note, I'm investigating some strange events. Since you're here, might as well help me out!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
You, too? What a coincidence.<br>
I know an ace investigator. I'll get her on the case.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
If you can, by all means!<br>
Although, the passage between your world and mine is pretty unreliable... If only it weren't, you could bring in your unstoppable fleet to solve all our problems.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
That's true. Unfortunately, I'm stuck on this pirate ship with only you to rely on.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Don't lose hope! You're a part of Tempesta, and I'll look out for you while you're here!<br>
...Hey! What's so "unfortunate" about me and my ship, huh?!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Just a little banter. Anyway, tell me about these strange events.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
There's been stories of rumbles in the deep, sea monsters that eat everything in their path, and terrifying so-called skelebeasts...<br>
The rumour is that something strange has happened beneath the surface.<br>
Whatever it is, a growing number of people have witnessed and suffered at its hands. Now even the routes between our cities are under threat.<br>
That's why I've called the rest of Tempesta to deal with the problem.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
For the good of humanity? That's awfully benevolent for a pirate.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
"Benevolent"? We're doing it to ensure the smooth flow of commerce! How will we trade otherwise?<br>
I'm not doing it for free, either. I went 'round and collected commission fees to do this from every city before I set out.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Smart! That way if your ship sinks, you can immediately afford a new one.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
"If it sinks"? Hah! Not with ME at the helm, matey!<br>
<br>
BWOOOOO!<br>
A horn is blown, and the next moment, a fleet of ships breaks through the storm.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Heheh! The gang is all here!<br>
Let's go, Commander! It's time for a captain's meeting!<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=The Gang's All Here|选项=3|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<br>
Aboard the Great Royal Fortune - Captain's Cabin<br>
As the various members of Tempesta gather, the din and hubbub of the cabin grows louder and louder.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Adventure Galley：</span><br>
Fortune! What were you bloody thinking, putting our meeting spot in the middle of– Why's the Commander here?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">São Martinho：</span><br>
Commander?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Golden Hind：</span><br>
Oh, my! What brings you here, my darling? Did you miss me?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
You're ALL here because I called on you! That includes the Commander!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Golden Hind：</span><br>
Um... So your call went all the way to another world, did it?<br>
<br>
Adventure Galley, São Martinho, and Golden Hind raise many questions, so I recount everything I've learned up to now.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">São Martinho：</span><br>
I see... It seems that we once more need your leadership for the battle ahead of us.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Golden Hind：</span><br>
Yes... To put it another way, destiny has brought us together again! Heehee♥<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Adventure Galley：</span><br>
That explains the storm. Wherever the Commander goes, tempests aren't far behind.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
São Martinho, you're still with the navy, yes?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">São Martinho：</span><br>
I am. I serve as a Nebula Guardian, which suits me better.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Works better for us, too! Having navy connections makes pirating easier.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">São Martinho：</span><br>
In addition, some of the commissions that Royal Fortune accepted were posted by the Nebula Guardians.<br>
It therefore makes sense that I be present to supervise her.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Yeah, yeah, cheers for keeping an eye on me and all that. Now, who wants some nosh?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">São Martinho：</span><br>
"Nosh"?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Adventure Galley：</span><br>
...Already put the stove on, I see.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
The storm hasn't stopped and we're still waiting for people, so yeah, I say we have ourselves something to eat!<br>
Plus, we've got to celebrate the Commander being here!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Golden Hind：</span><br>
All too true! I'll just help myself to these skewers.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Sure, eat all you want!<br>
I caught these... Uhh, I actually dunno what they are, but they're delicious and I caught 'em just this morning!<br>
You, too! Try these, Commander!<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：(Take a bite of the mystery skewers.)</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：(Give her a "no thank you" look.)</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''(Unappetizing texture, strange taste...)<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''I don't dare to savor the taste any longer, so I forcibly swallow the food – if you could call it that.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Pretty good, right? Have another!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''(It smells and looks really unappetizing...)<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''(For my own safety, I'll have to decline.)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Not hungry? Fine, just hold it, then!<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''I'll eat it for you! Nom!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">São Martinho：</span><br>
By the way... Are these "skelebeasts" edible?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Golden Hind：</span><br>
What?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：What?</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
You think I cooked and skewered one of THOSE things?<br>
Does this smell and taste like a sea monster to you?<br>
Also, just think about the name! If these WERE skelebeasts, shouldn't they be all bones and no meat?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Wait, do you even know what the skelebeasts look like?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
That's one of the things we're here to find out!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">São Martinho：</span><br>
Rest assured, I can confirm that this is not the flesh of a skelebeast.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Then why'd you phrase it like that?! Way to freak me out!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">São Martinho：</span><br>
I wanted to remind you about our objective here, since you were being so casual about this commission.<br>
Lest we forget that our target is a monster that threatens all trade between our cities.<br>
Supposing that this is a dangerous and elusive creature, we must take it absolutely seriously.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Yes, yes, whatever you say, ma'am.<br>
Bleh... My appetite's all gone...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Golden Hind：</span><br>
Mine, too.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">São Martinho：</span><br>
How unfortunate. In that case, I shall eat the rest of the skewers.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
You what?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Let's get back to business, shall we?<br>
Fortune, you said you're on an investigation, but to where?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Well, I have a few places in mind. There's the place where the last attack happened, so I'm thinking about checking that first.<br>
That is, once the gang is all here. Until then, we wait.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Who's missing?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Whydah said she's not coming, so we're just missing Mary.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
So if I got that right, the gang consists of Whydah, São Martinho, Mary Celeste, Golden Hind, Adventure Galley, and lastly you.<br>
Am I really not missing anyone? Didn't you say you'd recruit more members?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Golden Hind：</span><br>
......<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Adventure Galley：</span><br>
......<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
...Why are you all looking at me?<br>
Believe me, I HAVE been getting the word out and trying to recruit people! It's just not gone very well!<br>
In fact... I think someone has been sabotaging our efforts!<br>
Whydah is looking into the who and why as we speak.<br>
She'll uncover something any day now, so don't blame me for–<br>
<br>
KABOOOM!<br>
Royal Fortune is interrupted by the sound of an explosion.<br>
Looking out the cabin window, I see the red glow of a firework in the distant sky.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">São Martinho：</span><br>
That's her!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Adventure Galley：</span><br>
It's Mary's distress signal!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Looks like our saboteurs have escalated! Now they're engaging in full-on raids against us!<br>
Girls, get back to your ships! Prepare for battle!<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

<br>
Tempesta's vessels get into a neat formation and sail forward. It's not long before we reach the site of Mary's distress signal.<br>
KABOOOM!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Adventure Galley：</span><br>
Mary is outmatched two to one.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
They only have two ships? Then let's back her up and make it a five versus two!<br>
Marinho, you and Golden Hind go take care of the big one!<br>
Galley and I will blow the small one to bits!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Wait. Don't sink them, just neutralize them.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Why? You got plans for them, or something?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Do you know who the attackers are?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Uh, no?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Okay, and what are the odds that they knew about your meeting point and waited here to ambush you?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
That's basically impossible. Although, considering that they've been working in the shadows this whole time...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
If they knew about your rendezvous, why didn't they attack when you came here alone?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
What are you suggesting? That they just happened to be in the area?<br>
That doesn't really make sense. Why would they pick a fight with Mary in the middle of a storm?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
You came here to investigate those strange events – maybe the attackers play a role in them.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Can't deny that. They might know something.<br>
Right, you lot heard the Commander! Change shots and aim to cripple, not sink!<br>
<br>
<br>
KABOOOM!<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">Portsmouth Adventure：</span><br>
Guh! Stone me! She wasn't lyin' 'bout reinforcements bein' on the way!<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">Amity：</span><br>
Let's retreat. We'll get another chance.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mary Celeste：</span><br>
Hah. Tempesta's biggest ships are here, and you think you can retreat?<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">Portsmouth Adventure：</span><br>
Wuzzah? Tempesta?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mary Celeste：</span><br>
You heard me. You scared now? What happened to "giving me a whooping," huh?<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">Portsmouth Adventure：</span><br>
Hang on... You sayin' you DIDN'T command those those big-arse monsters into attackin' us?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mary Celeste：</span><br>
The only "monster" I control is Argo, and besides, YOU attacked first!<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">Amity：</span><br>
Oh. Yes, come to think of it, I only saw a single monster in the water during our battle...<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">Portsmouth Adventure：</span><br>
Bollocks. We mucked up 'n' went after the wrong one...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mary Celeste：</span><br>
You what?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Oi! You scallywags! We have you surrounded!<br>
Lower your weapons and surrender and we'll spare your lives! And your assets, I guess!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Portsmouth Adventure：</span><br>
Alright! We surrender!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Otherwise, we'll– Oh. That was easy.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amity：</span><br>
We'll hold you to your word – spare our lives and assets.<br>
Say, could we take shelter aboard your flagship? The wind is really picking up.<br>
Also, we're quite hungry. You'll share some food with us, won't you?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Oi... Why are you acting like we're friends now?<br>
Are you trying to trick me into letting you board the Great Royal Fortune to stab us in the back?<br>
You're NOT setting foot here! Make do with your own ships!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">São Martinho：</span><br>
......<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Let's let them explain who they are, then we can decide what to do with them.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Oh, right... They ruined my flow and I lost focus.<br>
So, who are you people? Why are you here? Why did you attack our ally?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amity：</span><br>
Well, Portsmouth, looks like we've run into an interesting group.<br>
<br>
Somehow, I get the feeling that the red-haired girl is staring at me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Portsmouth Adventure：</span><br>
Name's Portsmouth Adventure! This lass here is Amity!<br>
We're treasure hunters. We didn't plan on comin' 'ere until this storm appeared outta the blue!<br>
So we tried to escape the storm, then monsters attacked us all of a sudden!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">São Martinho：</span><br>
Monsters, you say?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Portsmouth Adventure：</span><br>
Were humongous, I tell ya! Knew they came from the deep the moment I saw 'em!<br>
In fact, they were 'bout as big as your Miss Mary's giant pet!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mary Celeste：</span><br>
You assumed I was controlling it and you attacked me? Is that it?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Portsmouth Adventure：</span><br>
Yeah. We'd just made it out alive, then we saw you commandin' another beast.<br>
Simply put, we jumped to conclusions! Sorry!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mary Celeste：</span><br>
So... I'm innocent in all this?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Portsmouth Adventure：</span><br>
Yup. Unless you're hidin' another monster somewhere.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Golden Hind：</span><br>
You know, we have five ships and you have two, so...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Portsmouth Adventure：</span><br>
Like I said, we're sorry! We'll compensate ya for the harm done, promise!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mary Celeste：</span><br>
There's no harm to speak of. You never even hit me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Golden Hind：</span><br>
Ah, Mary, but there was harm and you're overlooking it.<br>
There's the damage to the sails and ropes, then the cost of the cannonballs. That adds up to quite a lot for five ships.<br>
You'll pay the current market price to replace these things, won't you?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Portsmouth Adventure：</span><br>
Blimey... Ahah... haha...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
We can talk about compensation later. I have a more important question to ask.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Portsmouth Adventure：</span><br>
Yeah? Go on.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
You mentioned a monster from the depths... Is THAT what you were referring to?<br>
<br>
The waves churn on the horizon. Giants rise from the deep one after the next.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">???：</span><br>
GRAAAAGHHH!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Portsmouth Adventure：</span><br>
Th-that's them! The monsters!<br>
Let's get outta 'ere!<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=Rebirth and Eternal Life|选项=5|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<br>
The monsters pursue us at incredible speed, smashing through the waves.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
There's at least a hundred of them! Could this get ANY worse?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">São Martinho：</span><br>
On the contrary. We're quite lucky.<br>
This gives us a heap of information, and right on our first investigation.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Ah, all too true, milady! Could Your Invincibleness then please go and capture a specimen for us?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">São Martinho：</span><br>
......<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Exactly. See, it's only called an investigation when we have the initiative – when they do, it's called a battle to the death!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">São Martinho：</span><br>
At least we know now the strength of our enemy.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Portsmouth Adventure：</span><br>
Hey, Cap'n? We can't exactly run forever, so let's take to land 'n' seek refuge, yeah?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Golden Hind：</span><br>
I endorse this suggestion.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Well, we WERE gonna make landfall at Eisenblech to resupply anyway...<br>
It's not that far from here, and the Goddess does watch over the island.<br>
Let's go there! Should be safe enough!<br>
<br>
Eisenblech Island – Port – Sometime later<br>
On the shore stands a faintly-glowing statue of the Goddess.<br>
The skelebeasts had suddenly stopped pursuing us just a few nautical miles off the coast. In addition, the island seems unaffected by the storm we just braved.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Phew... We're still in one piece!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">São Martinho：</span><br>
Yes. For now.<br>
<br>
São Martinho gazes up at the statue.<br>
A portion of its face is battered and worn, a massive crack running along its back. One of its wings is missing as well.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Golden Hind：</span><br>
The Goddess statue has been destroyed... Who could have done this, and why?<br>
Moreover, how is the island still receiving her protection if her statue is ruined?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">São Martinho：</span><br>
No man did this. It simply fell apart on its own one day.<br>
This has happened across many islands... This one is just one of them.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Golden Hind：</span><br>
What do you mean, "fell apart on its own"?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">São Martinho：</span><br>
The Goddess' protection is growing weaker. That is evident from the arrival of these storms.<br>
The head of the Nebula Guardians must be informed of this posthaste.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Oi... You suggested this island as a resupply spot so we could investigate this statue at the same time, didn't you?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">São Martinho：</span><br>
As a reminder, doing this is a part of our commission.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Wait... Really?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">São Martinho：</span><br>
Did you even read the terms of the commission before you accepted it?<br>
I will make note of the statue in my report.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Okay! I'll leave the writing to you!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
So she accepted a commission from the Nebula Guardians to earn some money for investigating the attacks that she was going to anyway.<br>
Meanwhile, the Nebula Guardians combined that investigation with another one about the statues.<br>
So, is there any chance that the statues and the attacks are connected?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">São Martinho：</span><br>
There is.<br>
The reports about the skelebeasts and the ruined statues came in nearly at the same time.<br>
Naturally, this raised some eyebrows.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
So you admit it! You lumped the commission together to get two for the price of one!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">São Martinho：</span><br>
...Really?<br>
That's what you care about?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mary Celeste：</span><br>
Hey, I care, too.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Golden Hind：</span><br>
As do I. These things matter!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">São Martinho：</span><br>
......<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Portsmouth Adventure：</span><br>
Ahahaha! You lot are a funny bunch!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
I'd keep my gob shut if I were you! We haven't forgotten you attacked us just half an hour ago!<br>
You said you were treasure hunters, yeah?<br>
As promised, I won't take your lives or assets... but I WILL make you spill the beans on all the treasure I don't know about!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mary Celeste：</span><br>
Yeah! Give us the deets, NOW!<br>
<br>
The promise of treasure gets all the pirates riled up.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amity：</span><br>
Well, I heard a rumour a while back.<br>
Supposedly, a ghost fleet appeared from the depths of the sea.<br>
They say this ghost fleet returned through the power of a very special relic.<br>
In fact, we were chasing this ghost fleet until we were caught up in that storm.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Portsmouth Adventure：</span><br>
That legendary relic won't be an easy one to find!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Golden Hind：</span><br>
A ghost fleet? I've never seen anything like that.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
First skelebeasts, then storms growing stronger, broken Goddess statues, and now a ghost fleet?<br>
Ugh! This is getting more convoluted by the minute!<br>
And what's this about a "special relic"?!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Nobody knows what it looks like, or even if it exists in the first place...<br>
If the Goddess and the storms are connected, then who's to say the skelebeasts and the ghost fleet aren't connected as well?<br>
Whatever the case, we should treat these as two separate anomalies.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
I see the connection between the Goddess and the storms, but what links the skelebeasts to the ghost fleet?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
It's just a gut feeling. I think they have in common the trait of being undead.<br>
Seeing as skelebeasts spawn from shipwrecks, they're sort of like zombified ships. That's a lot like the ghost fleet – wrecked ships coming back to life.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Wrecked ships coming back to life... What if this all leads back to our old friend, the Fountain of Youth?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Not in any obvious way, if so. There are still many mysteries surrounding the Fountain, though.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Sounds like we should investigate, then!<br>
Porty, Amity, what will you do? You coming with us?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Portsmouth Adventure：</span><br>
Last I heard, the Fountain of Youth has been totally looted, so not much reason for us to go there.<br>
But, since it might lead to clues on the relic, we're goin'! To the Fountain of Youth!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Then we have a plan! We'll resupply then be off!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Before we do that, let's find Whydah and borrow Grimoire Terminal. Anything could be waiting for us at the Fountain.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Good idea. Once the resupply is done, we'll meet up with Whydah!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amity：</span><br>
I have a question. Which one of you is the leader of Tempesta?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Me! That should go without saying!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amity：</span><br>
I see, I see.<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=The Treasure Ship Cruises By|选项=6|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<br>
Tempesta arrives at Whydah's hideout, having avoided storms along the way.<br>
Thankfully, it was an uneventful journey.<br>
New World - Whydah's Hideout<br>
An ashen fog has engulfed the once-calm sea.<br>
A field of broken and charred planks covers the surface, extending as far as the eye can see.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Portsmouth Adventure：</span><br>
Bloody hell... THIS is where your friend lives?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mary Celeste：</span><br>
I smell the remnants of a battle... And the stench of decomposition.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Adventure Galley：</span><br>
Where's Whydah?! Is she alright?!<br>
<br>
BANG!<br>
A signal flare goes off, bursting into a blue light.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Golden Hind：</span><br>
I sent out a signal. We just have to wait for Whydah's response.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">The Ghost Fleet：</span><br>
KABOOOM!<br>
<br>
There is no response from Whydah – only the first salvo of an enemy that lies in wait.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">São Martinho：</span><br>
It's an ambush!<br>
<br>
One ghost ship after the next emerges from the water, making the sea look as though it's boiling.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Portsmouth Adventure：</span><br>
Well! 'Ere they are! They're real ghost ships alright!<br>
Talk about lucky! Wasn't expectin' us to run into them out 'ere!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Yes, lucky us. Since you're so lucky, why don't you go and capture one of them for us?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Portsmouth Adventure：</span><br>
Can I? Aw yeah!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Wait, you'll do it?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Portsmouth Adventure：</span><br>
Amity, we're going with Porty! And remember to try to aim this time!<br>
<br>
KABOOOM!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Tempesta! Give 'em hell!<br>
<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">???：</span><br>
GRAAAAGHHH!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">São Martinho：</span><br>
Skelebeasts incoming!<br>
<br>
KABOOOM!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Listen up! We're running away! If you like living, you'll do the same!<br>
Because you're burned bread if those monsters surround you!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Portsmouth Adventure：</span><br>
Dammit! I nearly got one of the buggers, too! Amity, let's book it!<br>
<br>
The shipgirls hoisted sails and, after a long while, finally shook off the pursuers.<br>
While they're out of the woods now, they haven't turned their backs on Whydah's hideout yet.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Adventure Galley：</span><br>
We can't just leave Whydah there. We have to go back.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mary Celeste：</span><br>
Whydah's smart. Knowing her, she left that place long ago.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Adventure Galley：</span><br>
Then why did the enemy lie in ambush for us rather than pursue her, huh?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mary Celeste：</span><br>
Beats me. Maybe she escaped without them noticing?<br>
Besides, there's no reason for them to linger if they've already sent her to Davy Jones's locker.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Adventure Galley：</span><br>
She could be hiding somewhere not far from here.<br>
If you're all staying here, fine! I'll go after her myself!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Whoa, whoa, hold on a moment! Nobody's said we're NOT gonna rescue Whydah, okay?<br>
Rushing in blindly is not the way to do it, though! We need a plan!<br>
<br>
While the girls hold a heated debate aboard the Great Royal Fortune, an abrupt event shakes the sea.<br>
BOOOM! BOOOM! <br>
A magnificent and enormous battleship emerges from the fog, thundering explosions from its guns tearing through the air.<br>
Dozens upon dozens of cannons erupt with black smoke, firing red-hot cast iron balls at the enemy.<br>
In but the blink of an eye, the ghost fleet and the skelebeasts are decimated.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amity：</span><br>
Isn't that... Ganj-i-Sawai? The treasure ship?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Ganj-i-Sawai? That girl who sails around, lugging tons of gold and silver?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amity：</span><br>
Yes. That's her.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Portsmouth Adventure：</span><br>
Bloody hell... Have a gander at that. How much treasure ya reckon she's haulin'?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">São Martinho：</span><br>
I wouldn't go after her if I were you.<br>
She is a high-ranking member of the Church of the Goddess. Attacking her will have dire consequences.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Portsmouth Adventure：</span><br>
Wasn't even considerin' it, angel! I was more thinkin', "Oi, aren't we saved now?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mary Celeste：</span><br>
Looks like she's running and gunning. Is that what she's doing? I think she's pulling it off well.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Golden Hind：</span><br>
I've spoken to her when we did business a few times before. She's not a bad apple, don't get me wrong...<br>
It's just you can never know what's going through her mind.<br>
<br>
While the girls talk, Ganj-i-Sawai herself appears on the deck of her massive vessel.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ganj-i-Sawai：</span><br>
O Goddess, put these weary souls to rest...<br>
<br>
She looks skyward, her face a reflection of pure reverence, and whispers a prayer.<br>
Next, she turns and looks at us with a beaming smile.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ganj-i-Sawai：</span><br>
That was close! I'm shocked there are such dangerous foes out here... Are you all okay?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Golden Hind：</span><br>
We're fine! Thanks for coming to our help.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ganj-i-Sawai：</span><br>
Oh, think nothing of it! I just happened to be in the area, you see.<br>
Here, allow me to return these sweeties to you.<br>
Catch!<br>
<br>
WHOOSH!<br>
She picks up two little girls and throws them our way.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Whydah：</span><br>
AAAAAAHHHHHHH!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">???：</span><br>
Wheeeee! I'm flying!<br>
<br>
They sail in a perfect arc through the air. Whydah hits the deck like a sack of potatoes.<br>
The other girl, meanwhile, nimbly lands on her feet next to me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">???：</span><br>
Heehee! Another happy landing!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Whydah：</span><br>
*cough cough*... Much stronger than she looks, that woman...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Adventure Galley：</span><br>
Whydah, are you okay?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Whydah：</span><br>
Okay enough. She came to my rescue as soon as the fighting started.<br>
What are you all doing here, anyway?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Adventure Galley：</span><br>
We're going to investigate the Fountain of Youth again, and the Commander said we should bring your Grimoire Terminal along, just to be safe.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Whydah：</span><br>
The Grimoire, huh...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ganj-i-Sawai：</span><br>
Ah, you're going to the Fountain?<br>
Are you also hoping to get your hands on that relic that can revive the dead?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amity：</span><br>
"Also"?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Portsmouth Adventure：</span><br>
Sure are! Got any info ya could share?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ganj-i-Sawai：</span><br>
That I do! But in exchange for what?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Portsmouth Adventure：</span><br>
Uhh... Amity, how much dosh do we have left?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amity：</span><br>
Porty, please. Do you think she would tell us anything if she wants the relic for herself?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ganj-i-Sawai：</span><br>
I certainly would not!<br>
As far as I'm concerned, you're my rivals!<br>
Don't expect me to give you any useful info, and even if I do, you shouldn't take it at face value.<br>
All I'll tell you is this – do go to the Fountain!<br>
Sure, it's been looted bare, but who knows? Maybe there's still something you can uncover!<br>
Now, if you'll excuse me, I'll be on my way.<br>
<br>
When she finishes, she turns her ship around and starts heading off.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Just a moment, Sawai!<br>
I think someone is using the relic to manipulate monsters and ghost ships into attacking people. I doubt they'll just hand it over if you ask nicely.<br>
Your best shot at getting it is to work together with us.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ganj-i-Sawai：</span><br>
I'll be just fine! The Goddess is watching over me!<br>
<br>
The rudder of her great vessel turns, and she vanishes into the mist in an instant.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">São Martinho：</span><br>
Even the Church has become engrossed in hunting for treasure...<br>
Despite the fact that these monsters and ghost ships pose a threat to all of our cities.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I think getting rid of the threat and confiscating the relic are the same thing to her.<br>
On the bright side, based on what she said, it all but confirms that the relic is no mere rumor.<br>
What's more... she probably knows much more about it than we do.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dolphin：</span><br>
Should we go after her?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
We'd better hurry if we're gonna!<br>
I'm not sure we'll be able to catch up to her even then.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dolphin：</span><br>
I can.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
On your own? That doesn't help. We've ALL gotta go after her!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Relax. We're not going after her.<br>
She called us her rivals. She might take it as a threat if we start following her.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dolphin：</span><br>
Really? She seemed like a nice lady to me.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Nice has nothing to do with it. We're clearly no friends of hers, so it's best to be cautious.<br>
All that is to say, we'll go to the Fountain of Youth as planned.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Aye-aye. Tempesta, get your things in order!<br>
Set sail for the Fountain of Youth!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dolphin：</span><br>
Set sail for the Fountain of Youth!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Nice! That's the energy I want to see!<br>
Wait...<br>
Who are you?<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=A New Face|选项=7|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Who are you?<br>
<br>
Royal Fortune stares dumbfoundedly at the little stranger who landed on her deck along with Whydah.<br>
The girl, Dolphin, tilts her head slightly to the side.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dolphin：</span><br>
Heehee. I was wondering when you were gonna ask!<br>
Hi, fellow captains. I'm Dolphin. I'm the new blood.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">São Martinho：</span><br>
Come again?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mary Celeste：</span><br>
Really? We finally got a new member?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Ohh, you're a new recruit. I'm Royal Fortune! I'm your leader!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dolphin：</span><br>
Wow! The leader! Hi there!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Portsmouth Adventure：</span><br>
Hold on a minute. I thought ya were a treasure hunter?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mary Celeste：</span><br>
Dolphin! I've heard that name before! Didn't think she'd be as small as li'l Whydah here, though.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Whydah：</span><br>
Heeey! Hands off my hat!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dolphin：</span><br>
Whydah's the one who let me join, actually!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Whydah：</span><br>
You've been dying for a new member, haven't you? Well, this little girl came here from far away, and she's honest and adorable, to boot.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Golden Hind：</span><br>
She's from far away?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dolphin：</span><br>
Yeah! I became a fan when I heard you discovered the Fountain of Youth, and I've been looking for a way to join you ever since.<br>
Then I found Whydah, but immediately after, all those baddies surrounded us and we had to run.<br>
That's when Ganj-i-Sawai came to rescue us, and the rest you already know!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Golden Hind：</span><br>
Did you hear that? Our little Whydah got us our first-ever new member!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Ugh! I worked my arse off, and Whydah just gets one for free!<br>
Still, I'm impressed you found her. She's our second-hardest-to-find member.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dolphin：</span><br>
Heehee. That's all thanks to my special ability.<br>
If Whydah's the second-hardest... who's the most?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Why, it's none other than...<br>
<br>
Royal Fortune points her finger at me with a snap.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
My vice-leader, {playername}, the Commander!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dolphin：</span><br>
Ohh! So you're Tempesta's commander. I'm Dolphin. It's nice to meet you!<br>
<br>
The little girl takes my hand and shakes it with all her strength.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
No, you got that wrong... It's just "Commander." Not "commander of Tempesta."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dolphin：</span><br>
Not your commander... Just "Commander"?<br>
<br>
Dolphin slightly cocks her head and shoots me a confused look.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Ugh... Look, it's complicated! It'd take too long to explain!<br>
All you need to remember is that I'm the NUMBER ONE leader of Tempesta! Okay?<br>
<br>
She prefaces with the phrase "number one" to make this point absolutely clear.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(She really wants to hammer in who the boss pirate is to the rookie, huh.)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dolphin：</span><br>
Okay.<br>
<br>
Dolphin nods in understanding, and Royal Fortune hands her a thick book titled, "The Tempesta Pact."<br>
And so, we resume our journey to the Fountain of Youth, with a new member along for the ride.<br>

<br>
And so, an uneventful 12 hours pass...<br>
Aboard the Great Royal Fortune<br>
Commander's Cabin<br>
Night<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Hey, you've not left your cabin since dinnertime.<br>
Doesn't it wear you out, working around the clock?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：I can handle it.</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：It's not particularly tiring.</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项3：I love my job!</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Blimey. Your work must be dreadful.<br>
<br>
She gives me a sidelong glance while I fill out another mission-related paper.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
You know, I don't think you've had a moment's rest since you got here.<br>
If you want my advice, take a nap. You can work after you've had your beauty sleep.<br>
And if you can't sleep, or if you're feeling lonely... I can sleep with you, if you want.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
This whole situation is complicated, and I want to go through all the information again.<br>
I'll be just fine. You can hit the hay if you're tired.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
I mean, I'm not really. Plus, watching you work is entertaining.<br>
I'll stick around a while longer, in other words. It's not like I have anything else to–<br>
<br>
CLUNK!<br>
The cabin door opens, and a large pirate hat comes into view as Whydah peeks in.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Whydah：</span><br>
Hey, uh, I've brought Grimoire Terminal.<br>
Said you wanted to borrow it, right?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Yeah. Thanks.<br>
You can hold on to it. As long as we're ready for surprises at the Fountain of Youth, it doesn't matter who has it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Whydah：</span><br>
Well, uh... It's been acting up for a while now. I've tried to speak to it, but it won't respond.<br>
See? Nothing but crickets.<br>
Maybe you can fix it, somehow...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(It worked just fine before... Do Siren electronics break that easily?)<br>
Let me have a look.<br>
<br>
......<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：(Examine it thoroughly.)</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：(Try to power it up.)</span>'''''<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''She hands me the "Grimoire." I examine it up-close, from top to bottom.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''(It looks undamaged, and I don't smell any fried wires.)<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Terminal, boot up!<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Alas, nothing happens.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Hmm. It could be a software error, or some internal component has broken.)<br>
(Alternatively, it could simply be out of battery.)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Portsmouth Adventure：</span><br>
What's goin' on in here, then?<br>
That little thing ya got there break, or somethin'?<br>
Want me to smack it? Who knows – might fix it!<br>
<br>
Portsmouth starts twirling the bottle in her hand.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Whydah：</span><br>
Nooooo! Don't do that!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Portsmouth Adventure：</span><br>
Ahahaha! I'm just kiddin'! Don't get so worked up, lass!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(If only Akashi were here. She might be able to fix Siren tech.)<br>
(I doubt we can get this thing working again on our own.)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Whydah：</span><br>
So, any ideas, Commander?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I can't figure out what the root issue is. It won't be easy to fix.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Whydah：</span><br>
Darn...<br>
<br>
Whydah hangs her head in low spirits.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I do have an idea, though. Do you mind if I keep it for now? I'll find a way to get it working again.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Whydah：</span><br>
Sure. You can have it as long as you want if you fix it!<br>
If you need replacement parts, let me know and I'll find some.<br>
<br>
THUD!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Huh?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Whydah：</span><br>
Whuh?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Did... Did the desk just move?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Portsmouth Adventure：</span><br>
I think it did...<br>
<br>
THUD!<br>
I knock on the desk, and it jumps again.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
What is this? Is it haunted?!<br>
Are we dealing with a ghost?!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
There's ALREADY a ghost on your ship.<br>
<br>
THUNK!<br>
Then, the cabinet doors under the desk fly open.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dolphin：</span><br>
Are you looking for something?<br>
I can help with that!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Why is there a compartment under the desk?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Because I saw some New World designs and got inspired!<br>
It makes cleaning easier if you can just pop it right open!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
......<br>
Why are you in there, Dolphin?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dolphin：</span><br>
I'm looking for treasure!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
On my ship?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dolphin：</span><br>
Yeah! I can sense there's some amazing treasure here.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
That is true... The Great Royal Fortune carries loads of treasure, and some of it is even exceptional...<br>
But that doesn't mean you can just take them!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dolphin：</span><br>
I know, I know. I'm just looking around and studying the ship's structure to kill some time.<br>
Anyway! What were you all looking for? I'm an expert at finding things!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Nothing at the moment. There's no telling what replacement parts you need without opening this thing.<br>
(Besides, replacement parts for Siren technology aren't exactly easy to find.)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dolphin：</span><br>
Ohh. Okay.<br>
Do you wanna sleep with me, then?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
HUH?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Portsmouth Adventure：</span><br>
What? Ya mean like... nappin' together?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
R-right, that reminds me! It's late! You should all go to bed!<br>
Nighty-night! Sleep tight! Go on, back to your cabins now!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Portsmouth Adventure：</span><br>
Eh? Feels like I'm missin' something 'ere...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dolphin：</span><br>
Maybe, maybe not? I can't tell!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Portsmouth Adventure：</span><br>
If ya say so. Then I'm off to have myself 'nother drink!<br>
Shrimpy, you stayin', or you comin' with?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Whydah：</span><br>
First of all, I'm not a "shrimpy."<br>
Secondly, I'm going back to my cabin.<br>
And lastly, you're the last person I'd drink with!<br>
<br>
Royal Fortune, Whydah, and Portsmouth Adventure all leave the cabin one by one. Only Dolphin remains, sitting under the table.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Shouldn't you get going?</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：Do you want something?</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dolphin：</span><br>
You still haven't answered my question.<br>
I asked if you wanted to sleep with me, and you never said anything.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
My hands are tied with work, so...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dolphin：</span><br>
Well, go to bed early tonight! You can always work tomorrow.<br>

<br>
Finally, we arrive at the ruins of the Fountain of Youth.<br>
As they gaze at the ransacked islands, looks of amazement appear on their faces.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Portsmouth Adventure：</span><br>
There it is! The Fountain of Youth! This was worth the trip!<br>
Although... pretty different from what the rumours say, innit?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
I was gonna say! It's completely different!<br>
Wasn't it, like, a big island of machinery last time we were here?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mary Celeste：</span><br>
Yeah, there was machinery everywhere.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
And now there's nothing but rocks left!<br>
What happened? Where'd all the technology go?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Golden Hind：</span><br>
It's been almost literally stripped bare... It seems we underestimated the draw of the rumours surrounding this place.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amity：</span><br>
Will we even find any leads here?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：We're already here. Might as well try.</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：We'll just have to look around and see what we find.</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''That's true. You're here, so maybe we'll get lucky!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amity：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''True! Although, it's not like we have any other choice.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">São Martinho：</span><br>
Let's split up to cover more ground.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Whydah：</span><br>
You do that. I'll stay here and stand guard.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Nuh-uh! You're coming along!<br>
<br>
And so, we split up into teams to search across the islands.<br>
Our search range grew and grew while the sky overhead darkened.<br>
Somewhere, in the ruins of the Fountain of Youth...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
You can't see anything when it's this dark outside.<br>
Since we're not going to find anything, we'll just have to call it for tonight...<br>
<br>
BEEP BEEP! BEEP BEEP! <br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Is that...?<br>
<br>
All of a sudden, Grimoire Terminal starts beeping from inside my backpack.<br>
I take out the tablet. There are a few glowing dots displayed on the screen.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Grimoire Terminal：</span><br>
The light of the Goddess is fading... Her core is decaying...<br>
The tide is rising... Order is collapsing...<br>
Only by putting the dead to sleep once more... can peace be restored.<br>
<br>
The flickering dots change shape, assuming the form of a map of the sea.<br>
A bright spot stands out on the map – it is clearly some sort of destination marker.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
"The Sleeping Sea"...<br>
<br>
Aboard the Great Royal Fortune<br>
Captain's Cabin<br>
Sometime later<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
...And that concludes the briefing!<br>
<br>
Royal Fortune displayed the map of the sea copied from Termina's screen. She briefed the others on what I told her earlier.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Adventure Galley：</span><br>
Sleepless Sea... Doesn't ring any bells. I don't think the books of the ancients made any mention of it.<br>
Also, the map places it at the very edge of the boundary between the Old and the New World.<br>
That sounds very dodgy to me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Whydah：</span><br>
I have a question. Are you SURE it was Grimoire Terminal speaking to you, Commander?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
You tell me. It's never booted up by itself before, and I don't remember it sounding like that the last time.<br>
Maybe it wasn't Terminal speaking, but rather someone else was speaking through it.<br>
Using... magic, I guess.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Whydah：</span><br>
That little thing is one big enigma...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">São Martinho：</span><br>
Supposing that it wasn't Terminal speaking, then who? Are they friend or foe?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
There's no way to know, is there?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">São Martinho：</span><br>
But if we don't know, this will make for an exceedingly risky voyage.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Portsmouth Adventure：</span><br>
To hell with it! We can talk ourselves sore, but what good will that do?<br>
Make up your minds! Are we goin' or not?<br>
Commander, what's your take?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
On one hand, it's a potential lead. On the other, it could be dangerous. I say we decide by vote.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
I'm in favour of going!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dolphin：</span><br>
Same here!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mary Celeste：</span><br>
- Let's check it out!  - I support it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">São Martinho：</span><br>
Personally, I'm against it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Whydah：</span><br>
As long as I can stay behind and stand guard, I don't care one way or the other.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Adventure Galley：</span><br>
If the Sleeping Sea does exist, that in and of itself will be a massive discovery. I support going there.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
So that's five in favour, one against, and one abstaining. Commander?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
If I must choose, I'm leaning toward going there.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
That's six in favour! An easy, qualified majority!<br>
We'll set sail for the Sleeping Sea in three hours!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Portsmouth Adventure：</span><br>
Hang on a minute! Don't me 'n' Amity get to vote?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
This is a vote among Tempesta only. If you want to have a say, you'll have to become a member first!<br>
So, will you join?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amity：</span><br>
Can we get honorary membership, like Martinho?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Yeah, sure.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amity：</span><br>
Then we'll join. Also, we both support going there.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Gotcha. That's eight in favour, even though we already have a qualified majority.<br>
Amity and Portsmouth Adventure, welcome to Tempesta!<br>
Now let's set off! To the Sleeping Sea!<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=The Sleeping Sea|选项=10|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<br>
The Sleeping Sea – straddling the line between the Old World and the New. It took us days to finally reach these uncharted waters.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
It's so foggy I have no clue what to expect in there.<br>
All ships, drop your speed! Keep some distance to avoid ramming into each other!<br>
<br>
Royal Fortune verifies her location on the map while she issues her order.<br>
The ships all lower their sails in preparation, then they thrust into the mist.<br>
The mood inside the fog oozes with apprehension, and even the sea and the sky take on a different look to the world outside it.<br>
While we are merely sailing through an empty sea, it feels as though we've slipped into another dimension.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(This feels familiar... Is this a Mirror Sea?)<br>
(No, something about it isn't quite the same...)<br>
<br>
Feeling the fog on my bare skin, a single thought pops into my mind.<br>
This place has its own aura, its own rules – its own mind.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Adventure Galley：</span><br>
There's no wind, and I can't feel any undercurrent.<br>
Have we... reached the Sleeping Sea?<br>
<br>
THUNK! THUNK!<br>
As the ship sails on, I start to hear the woody sounds of sea debris hitting the hull.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Portsmouth Adventure：</span><br>
What is this? The place is a damn ship graveyard!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amity：</span><br>
It reeks of gunpowder, too.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Portsmouth Adventure：</span><br>
Wait, I get it! It's called the Sleeping Sea 'cos it's where ships come to rest!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amity：</span><br>
......<br>
<br>
Amity facepalms in exasperation. The embarrassed Portsmouth places a hand on her pirate hat.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Portsmouth Adventure：</span><br>
I was just tryin' to liven the mood with an observation!<br>
C'mon, even I can tell these wrecks are here 'cos of some recent battle, alright?<br>
Look! The wood's all rotten 'n' there's steel mixed in 'ere. Those're from the ghost fleet.<br>
Then there's the burnt ship parts. Those're from the skelebeasts!<br>
Hang on, if the ghost fleet and the skelebeasts were 'ere... maybe the relic is somewhere, too!<br>
Oh yeah! We just hit the jackpot!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amity：</span><br>
I hate to rain on your parade, but I must ask: who defeated them all?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Amity raises a good point. Someone beat us to the punch here.<br>
If they're after the relic just as we are, that someone is most likely Ganj-i-Sawai.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Uh-oh! What if she found the next lead? She'll have a huge head start over us!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Portsmouth Adventure：</span><br>
Nooo! She might've already nicked the relic for all we know!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amity：</span><br>
Ugh... Settle down, the both of you.<br>
If the relic is the root cause of all the abnormal phenomena, and if Sawai got her hands on it, why is this blatantly abnormal place still here?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">São Martinho：</span><br>
At the end of the day, we must still investigate further.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mary Celeste：</span><br>
What's the plan? Do we follow the breadcrumb trail of wrecks, or do we go around them?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Let's follow the shipwrecks. If Sawai did do all this, the debris will lead us to her.<br>
Judging by when we spoke last time, she must've already known something about the relic and this sea.<br>
Still, don't lower your guard. With how many wrecks there are, I suspect there are many sleepless souls in the Sleeping Sea.<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=The Priest of Wind and Rain|选项=11|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<br>
Our fleet follows the trail of wreckages for a while, when all of a sudden the fog clears, laying bare the Sleeping Sea's true appearance.<br>
The debris and remnants of battle only grow more numerous, and the smell of gunpowder hangs heavily in the air.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Heh. Looks like we're catching up to her.<br>
These remnants are very fresh! Sawai has to be around here!<br>
<br>
BOOOM!<br>
Just then, a yellow light goes off overhead – it's a signal flare.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">São Martinho：</span><br>
A golden glow... The color of the Church's distress beacon.<br>
It seems that Ganj-i-Sawai requests assistance.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Portsmouth Adventure：</span><br>
Eh? Her ship is bloody massive. How could she get into trouble?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">São Martinho：</span><br>
By being greatly outnumbered, or by getting into an unfavorable situation.<br>
She is known in the Church not only for her great treasure, but also for being a priest of wind and rain.<br>
They say that the Goddess graced her with the power to draw strength from these elements.<br>
It is perhaps because of this strength that she was so confident in her own ability when we spoke.<br>
Here, however, there is neither wind nor rainfall, and the accursed relic may even weaken the Goddess' blessing.<br>
Given that, it's very possible that she has gotten herself into great trouble.<br>
<br>
KABOOOM!<br>
As we draw closer to where the flare shot up from, the sounds of fighting become very clear.<br>
It's not long before we sight her – the girl who was so cocksure is now surrounded and taking a beating.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Portsmouth Adventure：</span><br>
What do we do? Save her, or nab her?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Are you actually stupid?<br>
We're gonna save her, duh! The LAST thing I want to do is draw the ire of the Church!<br>
Plus, she'll be indebted to us if we help her!<br>
This is a golden opportunity to earn a favour from the Church – and moreover, from a priest!<br>
She'll be a HUGE force multiplier if we can convince her to join Tempesta!<br>
São Martinho, you're with the navy, so you go in first! We don't wanna cause a misunderstanding now of all times!<br>
The rest of you, get in formation and follow me!<br>
<br>
<br>
KABOOOM!<br>
Amidst the fierce fighting, the Great Royal Fortune suffers more than a few damages, as does the rest of Tempesta.<br>
Even so, they emerge victorious in the end by working together.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Phew... A glorious victory!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Adventure Galley：</span><br>
My hull has taken damage... Need to patch it up, quick...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Golden Hind：</span><br>
Oh dear... The cost of repairs will be eye-watering.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ganj-i-Sawai：</span><br>
It's you, Tempesta and the treasure hunters... I'm glad to see you, for what it's worth.<br>
Later, when you've tallied up the damage you suffered to save me, let me know how much it'll cost and I will compensate you in full.<br>
<br>
Though she smiles, the confidence she had on our first encounter is gone, replaced entirely with sorrow.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(That's not the look of someone annoyed over a treasure hunt going poorly – it's the look of someone who's deeply anxious about something.)<br>
(This is clearly more than just a hunt for a valuable relic to her.)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">São Martinho：</span><br>
Do you fear for the Goddess' safety after witnessing such fearsome foes?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ganj-i-Sawai：</span><br>
Yes... I do...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">São Martinho：</span><br>
Her power must have waned such that she is unable to protect you out here. It's deplorable.<br>
Will you tell us why you came here?<br>
We may be able to help you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ganj-i-Sawai：</span><br>
......<br>
*sigh*...<br>
<br>
After a hesitant moment, Ganj-i-Sawai breathes a heavy sigh like she's letting her guard down.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ganj-i-Sawai：</span><br>
I'm here on a confidential commission from the Church to investigate the strange happenings in this area.<br>
My goal, as you suspect, is to retrieve the relic that can revive the dead.<br>
I presented myself as a treasure-hunting rival when we first met, thinking working alone was going to be easier for me. <br>
I pointed you to the Fountain of Youth for the same reason – that coming here alone seemed the better option.<br>
Now, why are you here? Did you actually find a lead back at the Fountain?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Sending us on a wild-goose chase to get us away from you... So that's all it was.<br>
Luckily for you, we caught that wild goose! The Commander found a lead which brought us here, and just in time to save you!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ganj-i-Sawai：</span><br>
*sigh*...<br>
Luckily indeed. Fate is a curious thing...<br>
You think I'm a reckless fool for going into this sea all by myself, don't you?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
I mean... Actually, no! You're not!<br>
<br>
Royal Fortune quickly corrects herself, to which Ganj-i-Sawai lets out a snicker.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ganj-i-Sawai：</span><br>
Truth be told, this is a secret holy site for the Church. You could almost say it's its back garden.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amity：</span><br>
Come again?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Huh? Are you serious?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Adventure Galley：</span><br>
Then it's no wonder why it's not recorded in any ancient literature.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Whydah：</span><br>
You're telling me this weird place in the middle of nowhere is a holy site?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ganj-i-Sawai：</span><br>
It is! This is the Sleeping Sea, the birthplace of the Goddess. Only high-ranking Church officials know of its existence.<br>
People say that all these strange things have been happening because the Goddess' power is growing weaker.<br>
Well, we did a lot of research and our attention finally landed on this place.<br>
What we didn't expect was that this place had become overrun...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(From her phrasing, it sounds like she doesn't think we already knew this place was the Sleeping Sea, and that was why we came here.)<br>
(I'd theorized that she somehow fed us the name and the map through Grimoire Terminal...)<br>
(Unless she's feigning ignorance, we can rule out that possibility.)<br>
(Why does it still feel like she's hiding something from us, though?)<br>
(We would've gone to the Fountain of Youth regardless of if she told us to or not.)<br>
(The fact that Terminal received a signal there would've happened irrespective of anything Sawai did.)<br>
(Our reason for going there to begin with was to find a lead on the skelebeasts and the ghost fleet.)<br>
(Of course, there was nothing linking them to the Fountain. It was just a Siren machine, now completely looted.)<br>
(But, the monster and the fleet have appeared everywhere we go, from Whydah's hideout to this holy site...)<br>
(The undead creatures and the concept of "immortality"... Perhaps there's more than meets the eye here.)<br>
(What even is the Goddess? The deity of storms and the sea? Or is there more to her?)<br>
(And why does the Church consider this place of all to be a holy site?)<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：(Ask Ganj-i-Sawai about the Goddess.)</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(What if, like the Fountain of Youth, the Goddess is a machine of some kind?)<br>
Sawai, what is the link between this site and the Goddess?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ganj-i-Sawai：</span><br>
Sorry, who are you?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
A-ha! Let me do the introductions!<br>
This is none other than the founder and vice-leader of Tempesta! {playername}, the Commander!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ganj-i-Sawai：</span><br>
Ahh, it's no wonder why you're asking insightful questions.<br>
Normally, I wouldn't tell you a thing, much less allow you to come near a holy site.<br>
However, you found and came to this place by yourselves, and you did rescue me as well.<br>
Those things considered, I'm willing to tell you...<br>
Assuming, of course, that you'll keep it a secret.<br>
Simply put... this is where the Goddess lives.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Golden Hind：</span><br>
Where she... lives?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ganj-i-Sawai：</span><br>
Oh, perchance it's more apt to call it her "body." You see, the name of this place, the Sleeping Sea, refers to "the place in which Goddess sleeps".<br>
I'll explain the rest at the temple that's here. Come with me!<br>
If my theory is correct, the temple is where we'll find the answer to all these strange occurrences.<br>

<br>
After linking up with our fleet, Ganj-i-Sawai leads the way towards the temple in the Sleeping Sea.<br>
Though enemies continue to appear along the way, they are no match before our combined firepower.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ganj-i-Sawai：</span><br>
There! The temple is on that island!<br>
<br>
In the distance, the temple sits on a frozen-over beach, radiating a cold glow.<br>
Hundreds of ghost ships have already started gathering in the waters around the island.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Talk about a chilling congregation... There's so many.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Portsmouth Adventure：</span><br>
How're we supposed to break through that? Reckon we should just give up.<br>
That relic won't be any use to us if we die nabbin' it!<br>
We know where it is, we've seen it, and even just the tales of this journey will earn us a nice guinea.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amity：</span><br>
......<br>
What if we split in two? One group lures them away while the other makes landfall.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Golden Hind：</span><br>
It's a nice plan, buuut... isn't it really, really dangerous?<br>
We broke through their lines getting here, and there are still pursuers on our trail.<br>
Whoever has to do the distracting will get surrounded in the bat of an eye.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amity：</span><br>
True... Apologies, I didn't consider that.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dolphin：</span><br>
I know, I know! How about we swim and go UNDER the water?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">São Martinho：</span><br>
That's even more dangerous than going through the surface. The waters are brimming with skelebeasts.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dolphin：</span><br>
I could swim there easy-peasy!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">São Martinho：</span><br>
Okay... And what will you do then?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dolphin：</span><br>
I'm gonna steal the relic.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">São Martinho：</span><br>
...That sounds like it could actually work.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ganj-i-Sawai：</span><br>
It won't. You need a high-ranking Church member to be present to get inside the temple.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mary Celeste：</span><br>
Hmm... There has to be another way inside if this place demands such tight security. Is there, Sawai?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ganj-i-Sawai：</span><br>
There is... but you can only access it from the inside.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mary Celeste：</span><br>
So we're completely locked out is what you're saying...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Commander, think of something!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Right, first of all, forcing our way through is our last resort.<br>
Secondly, Portsmouth made a good point. All of you here came only to investigate matters, remember?<br>
Sure, getting the relic and solving all problems in one go would be ideal, but nobody's saying you have to do the impossible.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Hey, hang on a second...<br>
Yeah... My commission is simply to investigate the strange stuff and kill skelebeasts, not to resolve the situation.<br>
So since I know what the root cause is, that's mission complete. I can just go home with all the bounties and spoils!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Exactly. We can always come back later to deal with the ghost fleet.<br>
Also, considering how big this whole incident is, I'm sure the Church and the cities will take it seriously.<br>
Once we're out, we can contact all the parties and organize a joint fleet, then lead them back here and finish things for good.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ganj-i-Sawai：</span><br>
Yes, true...<br>
<br>
Ganj-i-Sawai gazes at the temple and lets out a sigh.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ganj-i-Sawai：</span><br>
It's the only way. Um, please don't tell the others about the Goddess' body in your commission report.<br>
The Church will muster some ships to deal with the ghost fleet. Don't worry about that.<br>
<br>
Suddenly, the sound of the sea breeze tickles my ear.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
The wind's blowing?<br>
No, wait... That's the sound of a storm!<br>
<br>
Dark clouds begin to swirl overhead. Gales rage and rain pours down.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(This storm formed WAY too quickly!)<br>
(It has to be because the Goddess' power has weakened... Storms can manifest in the blink of an eye!)<br>
(I shouldn't have let my guard down just because there was no wind!)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Quick! Hoist sails and get us out of there!<br>
Commander! Get inside the hold!<br>
Dammit, we won't make it! Just grab my hand!<br>
<br>
A massive wave slams into the ship, knocking me off my feet.<br>
The feel of Royal Fortune's hand is gone in an instant as I plunge into the salty sea, the cold raindrops whipping my body.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
COMMANDEEEEER!<br>

Something cold yet soft and smooth strokes my cheek... or so I think.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Nnh... Ugh...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Wait... what?：</span><br>
Nnh... Ugh...<br>
Hello, human.<br>
<br>
A thing in the shape of a human looks at me with a forced smile.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Who are you?</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fancy：</span><br>
I am Fancy. A being of the abyss, born from the imaginary.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(A being of the abyss? What?)<br>
(She does have a very... "unique" look about her, compared to the Tempesta girls I've seen.)<br>
(And yet, I just get this feeling...)<br>
(Yeah. She's still a shipgirl.)<br>
Thanks for saving me, Fancy.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fancy：</span><br>
You're "welcome."<br>
Let's get moving.<br>
<br>
Without any warning, one of Fancy's tentacles perks up and coils around my body.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fancy：</span><br>
This is faster.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Okay, uh... Where are we going?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fancy：</span><br>
To fulfill your mission, human.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
What mission?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fancy：</span><br>
The Goddess guided you here, just as she guided me.<br>
Therefore, the Goddess has a mission for you, just like me.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
("Guided me"? Is she talking about what Grimoire Terminal said?)<br>
(Didn't it say something about "connecting to a server"? What was that about?)<br>
(Maybe there really is a link between the Goddess and the Sirens.)<br>
Hang on. I want to check something.<br>
<br>
Hoping for a miracle, I take Terminal out of my backpack. It's still the same as before.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I should've figured it wasn't working again.<br>
<br>
Just as I stow the tablet back into my backpack, Fancy takes a few soft steps toward me.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Oh, this? It's a multipurpose tablet called "Grimoire Terminal". It's sort of broken.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fancy：</span><br>
Terminal? As in a computer terminal?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
？？？<br>
You're familiar with computers? How do you know about those?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fancy：</span><br>
The Goddess granted me this knowledge. She granted me this mission.<br>
Computers, grimoires, terminals – these are extensions of the will of the Goddess' central unit.<br>
I, too, carry her will. Perhaps you could say I'm a grimoire and a terminal, too?<br>
<br>
She tilts her head to the side and thinks about it.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Don't worry. You obviously aren't.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fancy：</span><br>
Very well. Then let us move.<br>
<br>
Her tentacles start to slither all around.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Wait up, there's one more thing I want to know! What even is this place?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fancy：</span><br>
The Kingdom of the Goddess. Her domain.<br>
You are in the Goddess' central unit. You are inside of her.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Central unit... The pieces are falling into place!)<br>
(The Goddess is no imaginary being, nor is she a transcendent god. She is simply a Siren machine.)<br>
(Then that means... all this time, the people of this world have worshipped a thing the Sirens left behind?)<br>
(More importantly, how does Fancy know about it?)<br>
(She could have ties to the Sirens... in which case, she must have all kinds of info.)<br>
Is the Goddess' central unit... self-aware?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fancy：</span><br>
Huh?<br>
<br>
She cocks her head, puzzled. It doesn't seem like she understands my question.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Different question, then. What does her central unit typically do?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fancy：</span><br>
Control the sea's climate and suppress the curse of the deep.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(I've never heard "climate" and "curse" used in the same sentence before...)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fancy：</span><br>
Many system errors accumulated within the central unit over its endless purges, and one day, the curse infected her with a virus.<br>
This virus has seized control of the unit, allowing the dead to appear all across the sea.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Although her explanation sounds bizarre, I now fully understand the situation.)<br>
In other words, you and I need to remove the virus to restore the seas to normal – did I get that right?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fancy：</span><br>
Not me. You.<br>
I know of no way to remove the virus. My mission is only to take you to the central unit.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Oh... Then I'll just have to figure something out.<br>
Alright, let's walk over.<br>
<br>
Once more, the tentacles slither around me.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Umm, I said "let's walk over," not "please carry me." You know what "walk" means, right?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fancy：</span><br>
You would prefer to use your lower limbs?<br>
Fine. I understand.<br>
Come along.<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=Silent Souls|选项=14|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<br>
Fancy and I walk through a massive mechanical structure.<br>
Our journey is smooth and unimpeded as the double doors slide open one after the next.<br>
After passing through a corridor, we arrive at a vast, open place, as blue as the ocean.<br>
A thin mist extends everywhere, and across it, I can see purple lights twinkling like little stars.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fancy：</span><br>
This is the Misty Pond.<br>
I'm surprised... Even they have come back.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Come back? Who?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fancy：</span><br>
The lights. The silent souls.<br>
They know we're here.<br>
<br>
Then, great beasts appear among the mist, swimming across the surface.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Those silent souls... don't they look a lot like skelebeasts?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fancy：</span><br>
They are the essence of the skelebeasts as well as their source of power. It's how they move.<br>
In fact, they are linked.<br>
They must be running rampant on the outside for there to be this many of them.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
So if they're linked, what will happen to the skelebeasts if we destroy them all?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fancy：</span><br>
They will lose their power and minds, becoming but empty husks. What they ought to be.<br>
However, consuming all of them will take considerable time.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Do they taste like anything?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fancy：</span><br>
No. They taste neither good nor bad.<br>
Want to try one?<br>
<br>
Her tentacles start to squirm.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Thanks, but I'll pass.<br>
At the same time, I don't think you can do this alone.<br>
Hang on – if you took out all the skelebeasts on the outside, what would happen?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fancy：</span><br>
Without bodies to control, the souls fall silent.<br>
Why? Will you tell your allies on the outside to deal with them?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
That's the plan. The question is how to get in touch with...<br>
Wait, how do you know about my allies?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fancy：</span><br>
I saw them with my own eyes.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
You saw them?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fancy：</span><br>
Take my hand. I will show you.<br>
<br>
She sits down by the side of the pond and dips her feet in the water, then extends a tentacle to me.<br>
Dodging the tentacle, I grab her hand and suddenly find myself in a new place.<br>
Skelebeasts swim past one after another in the ocean's deep, dark recesses.<br>
All I can do is watch, like an observer without a physical body.<br>
After a while, I'm brought to a different location.<br>
Then yet another.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Is this some kind of equipment the Sirens used to monitor the sea?)<br>
(Did she hook up her own sight to it?)<br>
<br>
One scene transitions into the next, flickering by in just the blink of an eye.<br>
Then I see a fleet of sailing ships at sea – and a girl in red wearing a pirate hat.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
The Commander's underneath the island? Seriously?<br>
<br>
I can hear her voice clearly.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(If this can connect directly to the monitoring equipment, maybe it can send audio, too.)<br>
(Won't hurt to try!)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
The Commander's underneath the island? Seriously?<br>
<br>
Standing on the deck of the Great Royal Fortune, the pirate girl asks a question.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dolphin：</span><br>
Yeah! I'd recognize that voice anywhere! It's below the island.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">São Martinho：</span><br>
Then we must make landfall.<br>
Luckily, the ghost fleet is in disarray thanks to the storm. We have an in.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Hey, can you hear me?</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：This is your god speaking!</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>

'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Ahem. Tempesta, can you hear me?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amity：</span><br>
What is that? I hear a whisper. Does anyone else?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Portsmouth Adventure：</span><br>
It's not just me! I thought the bottle was speakin' to me!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Golden Hind：</span><br>
So it wasn't just my imagination?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Hang on, wasn't that the Commander's voice?<br>
Commander! Where are you? I can't see you!<br>
<br>
Long story short, I told them I was fine and relayed my plan to them.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dolphin：</span><br>
See? I said the Commander was under there! Heehee.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Portsmouth Adventure：</span><br>
So if I got that right, we just gotta take out as many foes as we can, yeah?<br>
Easy-breezy! I've been rarin' for a fight!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amity：</span><br>
Allow me to lead the charge, then.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ganj-i-Sawai：</span><br>
Just so you know, there are loads of traps down in the temple. Be careful!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Come on, Tempesta! It's time to save the Commander!<br>
<br>
<br>
Tempesta gets to work, dispatching the monsters. The lights in the mist begin to disappear at a perceivable pace.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fancy：</span><br>
Those are powerful allies you have.<br>
It's about time that I did something, too.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Are you going to fight?</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：Time to have lunch?</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fancy：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Yes. To flex my muscles a bit.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fancy：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Yes. Just a little bite to appease my cravings.<br>
<br>
The air around Fancy bursts into purple flames that spread out like waves.<br>
Her blindfold turns to ash, revealing the inhuman eyes below.<br>
Lips parted, she thrusts her blazing tentacles into the sea of mist.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">Silent Souls：</span><br>
HISSSSS!<br>
<br>
The deathly shrieks of the so-called silent souls echo.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fancy：</span><br>
This is my true form. My true form as an abyssal being.<br>
It's a pleasure to see you, Commander.<br>
<br>
Water sloshes, explosions boom, and mandibles rip and chew. The lost souls are devoured with nothing left behind.<br>

<br>
Temple Underground - At the Central Unit of the Goddess<br>
At the center of this vast room stands a colossal machine, towering toward the heavens.<br>
An irregular, metallic shell encases it, covered in patterns and designs carved with gold.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(What are these gold patterns? That's very unusual for the typically-utilitarian Sirens.)<br>
(At any rate, I'm glad this machine isn't THAT big.)<br>
(Here I thought we'd have to deal with a city-sized structure, like the elite Sirens have.)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fancy：</span><br>
There is the central unit, human. Fulfill your mission.<br>
<br>
Fancy stands in a corner of the massive room and gestures to the machine with a tentacle.<br>
Everything appears to be safe.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(I've never directly operated Siren machinery before... but it shouldn't be too hard to at least extract some info from it.)<br>
(Besides, what else should I do? Nothing?)<br>
<br>
BEEP BEEP! BEEP BEEP! <br>
As soon as I approach the machine, the tablet in my backpack starts to beep. Terminal comes back to life and lights up all of a sudden.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Terminal? Are you back?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Grimoire Terminal：</span><br>
Terminal on standby.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(It just... started working again? Or did it activate by being in close proximity to the machine?)<br>
Run a self-diagnostic.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Grimoire Terminal：</span><br>
Charging field detected. Engaging charging mode.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
......<br>
(It was just out of batteries this whole time.)<br>
(Whydah didn't say anything about charging it, so it should work fine after this.)<br>
(Siren tech is mighty convenient.)<br>
<br>
Examining it, I quickly locate the visual interface you often see on Siren machinery.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I need access privileges. Terminal, can you hook me up?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Grimoire Terminal：</span><br>
Orders received. Processing... Processing complete.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Central Unit - Compiler's Wings：</span><br>
Verification complete. I'm Central Unit - Compiler's Wings, at your service.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(It worked!)<br>
(Interesting. "Con Pyler Swings." Is that the Goddess' name?)<br>
(I don't remember any of the books in this world alluding to her name before, but maybe...)<br>
(Wait... Con Pyler Swings...)<br>
(Is it... "Compiler's Wings"?)<br>
(Last time, it was Tester who'd gone nuts. It must be Compiler this time.)<br>
(I'd bet every Siren in this place has a few screws loose.)<br>
<br>
I want to ensure the virus won't interfere, so I start by running a security check.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(The status bar says the last self-diagnostic was performed two hours ago.)<br>
(Weird... It says it's "working as normal"?)<br>
(There should be a virus infecting the central unit which gave rise to the skelebeasts, if Fancy is to be believed.)<br>
(That can't possibly be how the system is meant to operate.)<br>
(I'll run another self-diagnostic, just to be sure.)<br>
<br>
Once the task is complete, I pull up the logs and examine them for any useful information.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Look at these files... The Atmospheric Circulation Adjustment Project... The Deep Sea Life Enhancement Project...<br>
The Tropical and Subtropical Marine Climate Adaptation Experiment... Silent Souls – Research on the Development of Wisdom Cube Applications...<br>
(It sounds like Compiler's machine has been running experiments by itself.)<br>
(Safe to say, everything that's gone wrong with the "Goddess" links back to these projects.)<br>
(Although, there are a few things this doesn't explain.)<br>
("Adjusting the climate" doesn't whip up storms in an instant, and this research into the silent souls makes no mention of ship parts or skeletons.)<br>
(That makes me think what's actually happening in the world is misaligned with what the Sirens had in mind.)<br>
<br>
The self-diagnostic concludes, and the screen only shows the words, "Nothing unusual."<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Maybe it's not a virus... Maybe someone has tampered with the system?)<br>
(But then, who?)<br>
<br>
Remembering the computer knowledge Ingraham and Helena taught me, I scour the system for any clues that might've been left behind.<br>
Despite my best efforts, I realize after a while that it's beyond my abilities.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(No dice...)<br>
(The only people who can do anything are me and Fancy... Actually, is it possible that she did the tampering?)<br>
(No, that makes no sense. She wouldn't have led me here if she did.)<br>
<br>
I turn around and look at her. She seems to shrug with her tentacles.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(This is a temple. A holy site dedicated to the Goddess. It's not out of the question that some internal sabotage took place within the Church.)<br>
(Or maybe someone just touched it without knowing the consequences and broke something.)<br>
(If it was someone from the Church, does Sawai know about it?)<br>
(I suppose she could know as little as I do...)<br>
(Oh yeah, didn't she say there was a secret path that connects to the outside?)<br>
(I just need to find that, then lead all the others in here.)<br>
<br>
With Terminal's help, I unlock the secret passageway leading to the outside.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(They say the Goddess has been a part of this world longer than anyone remembers.)<br>
(If these experiment logs are to be believed, the Sirens have actually helped keep the world in balance.)<br>
(The influence of the "Goddess" only weakened very recently, so with that in mind...)<br>
Terminal, is it possible to revert the experiment plans and restore the system to an earlier version?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Grimoire Terminal：</span><br>
Yes. Would you like to do that now?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Not yet. Later.<br>
This is Tempesta's world, and it's up to them to decide what to do with the Goddess machine.<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dolphin：</span><br>
Commandeeer!<br>
<br>
I greet the girls as they rush inside the room hosting the central unit.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Oi! I'm the leader, that means I get first dibs on hugging the Commander!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Golden Hind：</span><br>
My darling! I'm so glad you're safe.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Adventure Galley：</span><br>
Looks like the plan worked in the end.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Whydah：</span><br>
Even if it was a real pain...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mary Celeste：</span><br>
Commander, you gotta hear what Portsmouth did!<br>
She took her ship, right, and then she just... Ahahahaha!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Portsmouth Adventure：</span><br>
Said we could take care of 'em any way we wanted, didn'tcha? So I took my ship 'n' rammed the buggers!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amity：</span><br>
You're such a kid. Why do I work with you again?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Grimoire Terminal：</span><br>
It's good to see you again, Whydah the Magnificent.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Whydah：</span><br>
No way! Terminal!<br>
You fixed it, Commander?<br>
<br>
Whydah runs up and pulls the tablet into her embrace.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Whydah：</span><br>
Terminal, my beloved!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">São Martinho：</span><br>
......<br>
Who is that, Commander?<br>
<br>
Martinho's words get everyone else's attention. The girls all look at Fancy, who's next to me.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Well, she's the one who saved me from the storm, put me in touch with you, and showed me to this place.<br>
Her name is Fancy. She's a shipgirl and an abyssal being.<br>
<br>
Fancy raises her chin, satisfied with that introduction.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
She might even have ties to Ganj-i-Sawai and the Church.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ganj-i-Sawai：</span><br>
Pardon?<br>
I don't know what you mean. I've never seen her before.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
That aside, Grimoire Terminal allowed me to have a look at the Goddess' central unit.<br>
Let me run you through what happened and what the deal is with this huge machine.<br>
<br>
I explained the gist of everything I had learned.<br>
The silent souls, the cause behind the monsters, the reason why Fancy is here.<br>
Although, I withheld some details about the central unit and its status.<br>
All I told them was that someone had tinkered with it, leaving the Sirens completely unmentioned.<br>
As you'd expect, they were all shocked, especially Ganj-i-Sawi on account of her Church involvement.<br>
I finished by bringing up a few ideas on what to do about the central unit.<br>
Now it's time for Tempesta to decide the fate of their world.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Can you believe it? The Goddess was an ancient artifact, just like the Fountain of Youth.<br>
To think her graces were just nothing more than an attempt to maintain balance...<br>
The Church must've known that for ages. Why didn't you tell us?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ganj-i-Sawai：</span><br>
You say that, but her protection IS real.<br>
Also, don't you like her more now? Isn't this better than a real deity who judges you from the heavens?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Hmm. That's true...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ganj-i-Sawai：</span><br>
So now that you know the truth, won't you join the Church? Come and praise the Goddess with us!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
What's with the sudden recruitment attempt? You join Tempesta first and I'll think about it!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ganj-i-Sawai：</span><br>
I'm not going to let outsiders to the Church decide what to do with the Goddess' powers.<br>
Unless you join, I won't accept the results of anything you vote on.<br>
At the same time, you'll no longer be outsiders if you join, and you can vote with the rest of the Church on what to do with the central unit.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Sod that. I'm not joining any bloody church.<br>
Besides, whether we join or not, we all have the same idea of what to do with the unit.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I don't remember stating my take on what we should do.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
You didn't. You just gave us the facts.<br>
But let's not forget I know you better than anyone else here.<br>
Assuming this thing really is a threat and a burden, why should we waste time voting on what to do with it?<br>
<br>
Royal Fortune winks playfully at me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
So! What's it going to be, folks?<br>
Do we bring it back to normal, or do we wreck it?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">São Martinho：</span><br>
Let it be restored so the wind and the sea will protect us once more.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mary Celeste：</span><br>
Agreed! Better to have a Goddess than not, in my opinion.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Golden Hind：</span><br>
The Church will be greatly indebted to us if we fix it!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Adventure Galley：</span><br>
It's an ancient artifact. Repairing it is the best option.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Whydah：</span><br>
I don't really care either way.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Portsmouth Adventure：</span><br>
Is there a "Portsmouth can have it" option?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
No!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Portsmouth Adventure：</span><br>
Damn. Fix, then.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amity：</span><br>
Fixing it is the obvious thing to do.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dolphin：</span><br>
Let's fix up the Goddess!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Alright, nine support fixing it, zero want to break it, and one just doesn't care.<br>
See, Sawai? It's unanimous, and nobody even had to join any church!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ganj-i-Sawai：</span><br>
Wonderful! On behalf of the Church, thank you all for your resolution!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
That's that. Terminal, proceed with the system backup plan.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Grimoire Terminal：</span><br>
Orders received. Starting system restore program.<br>
Estimated time until completion: 15 hours and 23 minutes.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
This is gonna take all day!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Golden Hind：</span><br>
Well, seems we'll just have to wait.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Whydah：</span><br>
*yaaawn*... You do that... I'm gonna catch some z's...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Portsmouth Adventure：</span><br>
Oh, right, I just remembered!<br>
Fancy! Fancy, ya there?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fancy：</span><br>
Pardon?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Portsmouth Adventure：</span><br>
You live in this place, yeah? So ya gotta know this place inside out.<br>
There a pantry or pub 'round here? Got any grub 'n' spirits?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fancy：</span><br>
Spirits, you say?<br>
Yes. Those are everywhere.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Portsmouth Adventure：</span><br>
Jackpot! Get in there! Where're they at?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fancy：</span><br>
You want to consume them, too?<br>
I'll show you to the Misty Pond.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Portsmouth Adventure：</span><br>
Brilliant name for a bar! Let's go!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
......<br>
(Port's mouth is in for an adventure.)<br>

<br>
BOOOM!<br>
A mighty rumble shakes the entire temple.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Portsmouth Adventure：</span><br>
Bloody hell! What was that?<br>
<br>
Portsmouth Adventure appears in the corridor, Fancy's tentacles wrapped around her.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amity：</span><br>
Heehee. Have you had enough "spirits"?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Portsmouth Adventure：</span><br>
Blegh... Now's really not the time, Amity!<br>
Serious talk – that an earthquake, or what was it?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amity：</span><br>
Oh, I thought that was you. I suppose not.<br>
The Commander is examining the Goddess' machine. Shall we see what happened?<br>
<br>
Temple Underground - Central Unit<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dolphin：</span><br>
Whoa... Was that an earthquake?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Whydah：</span><br>
There goes my nap...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mary Celeste：</span><br>
The monsters are squirming. They're putting up one final struggle to stay alive... or stay undead, I guess.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">São Martinho：</span><br>
There are still ten hours to go. We'll have to defend this place to the death.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Adventure Galley：</span><br>
For ten hours? There's no way.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ganj-i-Sawai：</span><br>
Perhaps there IS a way.<br>
We can move the unit to my ship and flee rather than fight.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Golden Hind：</span><br>
Move it? How?<br>
<br>
The shipgirls all stare at the colossal machine.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ganj-i-Sawai：</span><br>
It's possible to perform a ritual that removes the seal upon it and move it to a new location.<br>
Of course, it takes time. I'll need an hour to complete it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
An hour is doable. It's worth a shot!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Portsmouth Adventure：</span><br>
Alright, I'll help!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ganj-i-Sawai：</span><br>
I'd prefer help fending off the beasts on the outside rather than with the ritual, thanks!<br>
Terminal is still performing the ritual of restoration. Let me stay here and keep an eye on it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Whydah：</span><br>
I'm staying if Terminal is staying.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Whydah...<br>
I'll stay. You should back the others up outside.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Whydah：</span><br>
Yeah, but...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
It'll be fine. They're out there. If anything happens, I'll sound the alarm at once.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Whydah：</span><br>
Okay. Be careful, Commander.<br>
<br>
Following a quick strategy briefing, the shipgirls take the secret passage up through the temple.<br>
The only ones left in the vast room are me, Fancy, and Ganj-i-Sawai.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ganj-i-Sawai：</span><br>
Well, have you any questions for me?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
That's my line. Don't you have anything to ask?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ganj-i-Sawai：</span><br>
In fact, I do! You're a mysterious stranger from across the storm. I'm very curious about you!<br>
Having said that, now is certainly not the time for pleasantries.<br>
Let us concentrate on doing what we need to.<br>
<br>
She casually trots over to an empty part of the room.<br>
With a silent song in her mind, she then takes the first step of a graceful dance.<br>
Vivaciously she moves, dancing with the sublimity of a flower blooming in the early spring.<br>
Her ornamental bells chime softly while her sleeves draw beautiful curves through the air.<br>
As she breaks into dance, a glowing golden pattern emerges on the floor.<br>
It flickers gently, seemingly in resonance with the pattern on the central unit's shell.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Grimoire Terminal：</span><br>
Orders received. Executing command.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Whoa, even Terminal is glowing gold...)<br>
(Is it really a part of the central unit's transfer ritual?)<br>
(That... actually makes sense.)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ganj-i-Sawai：</span><br>
O Goddess, let this prayer carry you to a safe place!<br>
<br>
She offers a prayer, and the central unit begins to shrink rapidly until it becomes a metal box no larger than Terminal is.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ganj-i-Sawai：</span><br>
The ritual is finished, Commander! Let's board my ship and get out of here!<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=Echoes of the Wind and Rain|选项=18|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<br>
After escaping from the temple, I'm invited to a feast aboard Ganj-i-Sawai's ship.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ganj-i-Sawai：</span><br>
I haven't had a chance to stock up on spices, so this may taste a little bland.<br>
Still, it should be better than the grub Fancy offered!<br>
I hope you'll like it, Commander.<br>
<br>
The dining hall is furnished appropriately for a ship named "Exceeding Treasure," and the table is lined with lavish meals.<br>
The gently flickering candlelight and the exotic aroma in the air lend the hall a definitively mysterious ambiance.<br>
But, on the other hand...<br>
KABOOOM!<br>
On the outside, the ship's cannons fiercely bombard the sea.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Such might... Each shot is equal to an Enforcer in power.)<br>
(Sawai has felt... different ever since the central unit was placed aboard.)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ganj-i-Sawai：</span><br>
Don't worry about your friends. What enemies are left outside aren't a big threat.<br>
Clear your mind and enjoy the feast.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
You're right. One thing, though...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ganj-i-Sawai：</span><br>
Let's dig in and continue from there, shall we?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Sure.<br>
<br>
I grab a small loaf of bread on a plate in front of me and take a bite.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Hmm... Curry bread?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ganj-i-Sawai：</span><br>
Now then, what did you wish to talk about?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I won't beat around the bush. Were you after the Goddess' machine from the start?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ganj-i-Sawai：</span><br>
Indeed! I was surprised you agreed to my plan to transfer it to my ship.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
If I hadn't, we'd all be in danger.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ganj-i-Sawai：</span><br>
Hmm. Maybe...<br>
Wait, you don't think I put the enemies around the island so I could take the machine for myself, do you?<br>
Because I didn't. Let's not forget they targeted me, too.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
No, no, I don't think you were playing both sides for this.<br>
It's just that I have my reasons to not fully trust the Church.<br>
Tell me, what do you want from the machine?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ganj-i-Sawai：</span><br>
Nothing outrageous. Just the power to crush any foe.<br>
Like this!<br>
<br>
KABOOOM!<br>
Her cannons light up the night sky in a show of might.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Let me ask something different.<br>
How long has our group been a part of your plan?<br>
Ever since you rescued Whydah and learned about Grimoire Terminal?<br>
Or even before that? Were you gunning for Terminal all along and "saved" her?<br>
It wouldn't have been possible to move the central unit without it, after all.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ganj-i-Sawai：</span><br>
My, my, you really are a sharp one.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
And you're a great actor.<br>
I really did think it was a coincidence that Terminal gave us that map.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ganj-i-Sawai：</span><br>
Heehee. Thank you.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
How much does the Church know about what's been happening?<br>
Furthermore, how much does it know about ancient artifacts?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ganj-i-Sawai：</span><br>
Now, now, I've not done anything to hurt you this whole time, have I?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
No, but you did undeniably deceive a whole bunch of people.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ganj-i-Sawai：</span><br>
And I promise that's the full extent of my sins. Won't you keep it a secret between us?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Why should I?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ganj-i-Sawai：</span><br>
Because you haven't told the whole truth either, have you? About the central unit.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(She knows?!)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ganj-i-Sawai：</span><br>
Listen. I'm not your enemy.<br>
As for your other concerns... they're not so important now, are they?<br>
<br>
She shrugs and forces a slightly awkward smile.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ganj-i-Sawai：</span><br>
Come on. Relax a bit and enjoy the feast.<br>
Don't let this candlelit atmosphere go to waste!<br>
<br>
As soon as I hear the words, "Relax a bit," an overwhelming sleepiness comes over me.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Sawai... Did you...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ganj-i-Sawai：</span><br>
Forgive me. I used a little medicine in place of spices.<br>
It wasn't in the food – it was in this aroma.<br>
<br>
Sweetly and graciously, she smiles at me.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Urgh...<br>
<br>
My eyelids grow heavy and my sight becomes cloudy.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ganj-i-Sawai：</span><br>
Don't worry. Your friends are safe. I swear it on my honour.<br>
<br>
As my consciousness recedes into the darkness, I feel a warm embrace around me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ganj-i-Sawai：</span><br>
Good night, Commander.<br>
There is no need to say farewell.<br>
Because we will meet again.<br>

<br>
Somewhere, in an unknown location...<br>
When I open my eyes, I'm met with an endless expanse of blue.<br>
The compass glows faintly as it casts its light in a certain direction.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
The compass...<br>
Ah, that light... It's time to go home...<br>
<br>
The light grows brighter and brighter until eventually, it engulfs everything.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
The next time I open my eyes, what greets me is the familiar ceiling of my home.<br>
<br>
I check the alarm clock beside my bed. Not much time has passed since I lay down.<br>
And yet, I know that the adventure I just had was no dream.<br>
The proof is right there – in my hand.<br>
It is the golden compass, shining lustrously. <br>
My pirate adventure really did happen.<br>
And, it certainly won't be my last.<br>
Tempesta and the Sleeping Sea - The End?<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=The Tale of the Sleeping Sea|选项=20|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<br>
A whistle blew and sails were hoisted. The weather was ideal for a voyage.<br>
The treasure hunters of Tempesta stand on the deck, their red hair blowing in the wind.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Portsmouth Adventure：</span><br>
Aahh! Nothin' beats the sea breeze!<br>
Whatcha gonna do now, Amity?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amity：</span><br>
Figure out what the Church is up to.<br>
It feels like we were played like a fiddle.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Portsmouth Adventure：</span><br>
Uh, were we?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amity：</span><br>
Ganj-i-Sawai said the Commander went back home, but if there's one thing I know, it's that that one wouldn't leave without saying goodbye.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Portsmouth Adventure：</span><br>
Eh? Didn't Royal Fortune say everything went fine?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amity：</span><br>
Then that means that our leader is hiding something from us.<br>
Don't you want to know what?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Portsmouth Adventure：</span><br>
If there's no money in it, not really. Or what, are ya gonna blackmail one of our own?<br>
Because I'm NOT doin' that!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amity：</span><br>
Then what about becoming famous?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Portsmouth Adventure：</span><br>
What? Famous?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amity：</span><br>
You heard me.<br>
Greater fame means more ruins to explore and more ancient relics we can get. Also more adventure.<br>
Heehee. First, though, we'll have to get our names out there.<br>
By spreading the story of Tempesta and the Sleeping Sea.<br>

<br>
Sometime later, at the Tempesta meeting spot...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
You won't believe this! I heard loads of people talking about our adventure in the Sleeping Sea while I was on the way here!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Golden Hind：</span><br>
I've heard the tales, too. The word has gone quite far!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Which means our fame is growing!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dolphin：</span><br>
From what I've heard, it was two treasure hunters who spread the word.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Ah, Dolphin! How did that probe go?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dolphin：</span><br>
Pretty good! Here's what you asked Whydah to find out.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Fantastic!<br>
Also, you said "two treasure hunters"... Could that be Portsmouth and Amity?<br>
If so, they're doing us a real favour out there.<br>
If our fame keeps spreading at this rate, then the next time the Commander shows up...<br>
Who knows? Maybe we'll be several dozen strong by then!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">São Martinho：</span><br>
Really? I think that's unrealistic.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Ugh! Don't be such a killjoy, Martinho!<br>
...You don't have bad news for me, do you?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">São Martinho：</span><br>
No. Nothing of the sort.<br>
I just have a hunch that our ranks won't grow much.<br>
Think of it as a curse placed upon us.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
Not one more word about curses! It's frightening how plausible that is!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">São Martinho：</span><br>
However, our luck may turn around, should the Commander return.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
What makes you say that?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">São Martinho：</span><br>
A hunch.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Golden Hind：</span><br>
......<br>
Incidentally, I heard you escorted Sawai to the Church. How did that go?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">São Martinho：</span><br>
It went well. Few things can threaten someone like her.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Golden Hind：</span><br>
Did she tell you anything?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">São Martinho：</span><br>
No, but she did give me a curry bread recipe that's quite good.<br>
She said the Commander liked it at her banquet, so I'm trying to make it as well.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dolphin：</span><br>
Ooh! Whydah's gonna love what you just said!<br>
Can I be excused?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
You're leaving? You don't wanna go drinking with us?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dolphin：</span><br>
No thanks! I already finished resupplying while you were talking.<br>
Whydah's asked me to do a bunch of stuff, so I need to get going!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Fortune：</span><br>
She's working you like a dog... Should I tell her off?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dolphin：</span><br>
I can handle it. Plus, I love visiting her!<br>
She knows all kinds of cool things and has all these plans going on...<br>
Oh, but don't tell anyone! It's a fun secret.<br>
She also says we're all gonna go on more amazing adventures together soon!<br>
It's gonna be so much fun!<br>

<br>
Somewhere, in an unknown location...<br>
A shipgirl was performing a ceremonial dance in a vast room.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ganj-i-Sawai：</span><br>
O Goddess, let this prayer carry you to a safe place.<br>
<br>
As the light withdrew, Ganj-i-Sawai's dance came to a stop.<br>
So, too, did the mysterious ritual she was conducting.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ganj-i-Sawai：</span><br>
The Goddess' first miracle – Compiler's Eyes.<br>
Wings that give shape, eyes that discern...<br>
Soon, the Goddess shall return to us...<br>
<br>
The sound of waves could be heard from somewhere within the room.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ganj-i-Sawai：</span><br>
The Star Wayfinders have caught on to us.<br>
I'll clean up our tracks. Keep them busy in the meantime...<br>
...O faithful one.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fancy：</span><br>
......<br>
Understood.<br>
<br>
