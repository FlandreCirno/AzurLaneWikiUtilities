The Secret to Curing Exhaustion?!<br>
<br>
1 An Excellent Secretary Ship<br>
Commander's Office - Nighttime<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Ah...<br>
(Must have fallen asleep at some point. I should really start drinking coffee for these all-nighters...)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">???：</span><br>
Good morning, Commander~<br>
<br>
A sweet whisper reaches my ears. I realize that I'm leaning on San Jacinto.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Uh... What's going on?<br>
<br>
When she sees my vacant confusion, San Jacinto explains the situation.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">San Jacinto：</span><br>
I thought sleeping face-down on the table would be bad for your upper spine, so I took the liberty of moving you.<br>
But... Commander? You haven't rested at all lately, have you? I moved you so much, and you didn't come close to waking up.<br>
How many all-nighters did you put yourself through until I took up the secretary ship position?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Ahem... Don't ask. I have a lot of unfinished paperwork left over, and I need to get it done soon...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">San Jacinto：</span><br>
You mean that pile of papers that was here? I took care of it while you were sleeping.<br>
The only ones left are the ones that need your signature.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
You did all that? Even the supply manifest?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">San Jacinto：</span><br>
Heehee. Of course I took care of that.<br>
Your work's done, Commander. Come lie on my shoulder a little longer, if you'd like. Ooor... I'd be happy to let you lay your head in my lap, too♪<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Thanks for your help. I thought I'd be up all night again, so that's a relief.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">San Jacinto：</span><br>
Now now, you don't have to thank me. I couldn't help myself because I just love looking after you!<br>
I made sweets, too. If you don't want to rest any longer, at least consider enjoying a little midnight snack.<br>
<br>
The sweets, so perfectly made that it feels like a waste to eat them, give off a hunger-inducing aroma.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">San Jacinto：</span><br>
What's the matter, Commander? Do they not suit your taste?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：I'd feel bad eating them...</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：It's hard to choose one to eat first.</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">San Jacinto：</span><br>
Oh, my. I didn't know you were the kind of person to worry over such things.<br>
But I do want you to eat them~ You've worked so hard for so long. You'll need to build your energy back up!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I'm really glad to have such an excellent secretary ship helping me out.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">San Jacinto：</span><br>
Heehee~ Well, Commander, don't you think this excellent secretary ship deserves a reward?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
A reward? Is there anything you want?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">San Jacinto：</span><br>
I haven't decided yet~ When I do, I'll be sure to let you know, heehee♪<br>

The Secret to Curing Exhaustion?!<br>
<br>
2 Is the Secret Good Food?<br>
When I arrive at my office the next morning, I find San Jacinto already single-mindedly focused on paperwork.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">San Jacinto：</span><br>
The second supply manifest needs a second pair of eyes on it.<br>
The port's overhead crane has broken down, too. We'll need to have it repaired.<br>
Oh, Commander? You're just standing at the door... Are you entranced by the sight of my work?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
......<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">San Jacinto：</span><br>
Haha, I'm just kidding~ Don't be so bashful, Commander...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
No. I'm just surprised that you got here so early, San Jacinto.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">San Jacinto：</span><br>
I think it's only right for a secretary ship to arrive before her Commander.<br>
More importantly, did you sleep well last night?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Yeah. Thanks to you, I slept like a log for the first time in a long time.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">San Jacinto：</span><br>
That's lovely~ By the way, I can help you... in ways other than work, you know.<br>
<br>
San Jacinto puts down her documents, rests her chin in her hands, and smiles meaningfully at me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">San Jacinto：</span><br>
Heehee, come on in already. Your breakfast is getting cold.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Breakfast...?<br>
<br>
Confused, I approach my desk. I realize a luxurious breakfast has been put there without my noticing.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">San Jacinto：</span><br>
I made your breakfast full of nutrients! It won't just give you energy – it'll heal your exhaustion, too!<br>
You scrape by on convenient instant foods when you're busy, don't you? From now on, we're having no more of that!<br>
You must eat balanced, nutritious meals on time.<br>
Most of all, good food is the secret to curing exhaustion♡<br>
I sound a little too proud, don't I? I just hope my home cooking is enough to soothe your heart, Commander~<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
You shouldn't go out of your way for me...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">San Jacinto：</span><br>
That's not true at all.<br>
As your secretary ship, it's my duty to support you both in your work and in your private life!<br>

<br>
The Secret to Curing Exhaustion?!<br>
<br>
3 Overnight Operation ♡<br>
After finishing San Jacinto's homemade breakfast, I focus hard on work.<br>
But even after half the day has passed, half of my desk is still taken up by work waiting to be done.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">San Jacinto：</span><br>
Goodness, time flies.<br>
I wanted to be with you a little longer, but it's almost time for the joint exercise...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
You've already helped me plenty.<br>
<br>
She glances at the pile of documents hesitantly.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
This much is just fine. Believe in me for once.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">San Jacinto：</span><br>
I don't mean to doubt your abilities, but... Look how much there is. It'll take time even for you to handle all that.<br>
I'll be back as soon as the joint exercise is over. Consider taking a break for now, okay?<br>
I brought sweets again, so consider it an impromptu tea time~ Come on, Commander. Slack off a little once in a while, would you...?<br>
<br>
San Jacinto leans in close. Her hot breath tickles my ear.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">San Jacinto：</span><br>
What do you say?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：As Commander, I can't just slack off...!</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：I have to set a good example as the Commander!</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">San Jacinto：</span><br>
Heehee~ I knew you'd say that. That's part of what I love about you, after all.<br>
But don't put yourself through too much, okay?<br>
Let's work together again as soon as I'm back from the joint exercise.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(San Jacinto takes her secretary work so seriously...)<br>
(I guess I'd feel bad if I didn't let her help out.)<br>
Okay. If I'm not done when you get back, then I'll have you work overnight with me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">San Jacinto：</span><br>
Aww~ The Commander's inviting me over for a night together♡<br>
Your secretary ship wouldn't dare disappoint~<br>
I hope you're as excited as I am!<br>
<br>
The door is suddenly flung open. Behind it is Independence, who stares into the room, stunned.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Independence：</span><br>
What did you just say? A... A night together...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">San Jacinto：</span><br>
Yep! The Commander wants to spend a night with me♡<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Independence：</span><br>
Y-you don't mean you'll...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">San Jacinto：</span><br>
Well, that depends on the Commander's wants!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Okay, can't have her misunderstanding any more than that. I'd better explain things.)<br>
By "a night together," I mean that I'm having San Jacinto help me out...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">San Jacinto：</span><br>
That's right. It's a secretary's duty to make sure her Commander's needs are met!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Independence：</span><br>
With mutual consent... right? Nobody's forcing anyone to do anything here?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Of course not. I'd never force her to do such a thing.<br>
(It IS secretary work, and San Jacinto offered of her own free will, so I don't think I'm forcing her...)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">San Jacinto：</span><br>
I promise you, I'm serving my Commander purely out of my own desire.<br>
Though I do think every secretary SHOULD do it~ Heehee~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Independence：</span><br>
H-hold up! Is that actually a part of the job?<br>
<br>
Independence blushes madly, and her eyes swim all around the room. Eventually, they stop on the sweets San Jacinto brought.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Okay, fair. Making sweets isn't exactly part of the job description.)<br>
We started doing this last night. She saw that I was exhausted, so she did that for me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">San Jacinto：</span><br>
It's my secret to helping the Commander work to the fullest~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Independence：</span><br>
......<br>
<br>
Independence's confusion only grows.<br>

The Secret to Curing Exhaustion?!<br>
<br>
4 How to Wake a Sleeping Beauty<br>
After getting one very confused Independence to leave, San Jacinto left for her joint exercise, and I immersed myself in work again.<br>
By afternoon, the pile of documents on my desk has shrunk considerably.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Already that time, huh? It's about time for the joint exercise to end.<br>
Helping me work, participating in joint exercises... San Jacinto must be exhausted, too.<br>
I'll go out to the port to meet her.<br>
<br>
When I search the wharf where the exercise was held, though, I find no sign of her.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Am I too late?<br>
<br>
While I search, I run into someone I saw very recently.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Independence：</span><br>
Commander? Why are you here? Shouldn't you and San Jacinto be... Ahem!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Is it just me, or is she looking at me weird...? No, I'm probably imagining it. I've just been working too much.)<br>
I'm looking for her right now. Do you know where she is?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Independence：</span><br>
Huh? You didn't bump into her?<br>
After the exercise, she was in such a hurry to get back to your office.<br>
I don't think I've ever seen her in such a hurry...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Is she getting ready for our all-nighter...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Independence：</span><br>
M-maybe... *blush*<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Thanks for letting me know.<br>
<br>
Now that I know San Jacinto and I missed each other, I rush back to my office again.<br>
When I get back, I see that the pile left on my desk is just a little smaller.<br>
San Jacinto is asleep, face-down on my desk. The gentle smile on her face is almost picturesque.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Didn't she say sleeping like that is bad for your spine? She must be more tired than I thought.)<br>
(If I leave her like that, she'll have some bad aches when she wakes up. I'd better help her out.)<br>
<br>
Carrying her over to the couch and laying her down there wouldn't be too difficult.<br>
Doing that without waking her, though, seems nigh impossible.<br>
I think about it for a while and decide to carry her princess style.<br>
Gently, I lift her from the chair and lower her onto the couch.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Let's get back to work. There's still plenty of paperwork left to go around...)<br>
<br>
When I try to leave her there, though, the girl I'd thought was asleep reaches out and grabs my shirt.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">San Jacinto：</span><br>
No fair, Commander~<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Sorry. I tried not to wake you up, but I guess that didn't work out...<br>
What's not fair, though?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">San Jacinto：</span><br>
You promised we'd stay up late together, didn't you? Did you already forget?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I can't possibly make you stay up with me after seeing you fall asleep in the middle of work.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">San Jacinto：</span><br>
Naps ARE good at helping you recover from exhaustion, but...<br>
Commander, are you sure that was enough?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Hmm?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">San Jacinto：</span><br>
When you're waking a sleeping beauty, don't you need the magic of love? True love's kiss, was it?<br>
That's how it works in the fairy tales...<br>
You went through the trouble to princess carry me. And then you go back to work like nothing happened? That's just mean~<br>

The Secret to Curing Exhaustion?!<br>
<br>
5 Is the Secret Vacation?<br>
Despite San Jacinto's petty complaints, we work late into the night.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">San Jacinto：</span><br>
This is the last one, Commander.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Finally over, huh? Good work today.<br>
I can only imagine how bad it would've been without your help.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">San Jacinto：</span><br>
You're still so mean, Commander~ Do you think a compliment is enough now that we've come this far?<br>
<br>
She teases, but there's a hint of expectation in her eyes.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I'm off tomorrow. Do you want to go out somewhere together?<br>
We could call it relaxation.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">San Jacinto：</span><br>
Are you saying you wanna go on a date with me?<br>
Heehee. I'll take that as my reward, then.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(She did say she wanted a reward, but...)<br>
(Just going out together doesn't seem like it's enough. I should commit more than that.)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">San Jacinto：</span><br>
What's the matter, Commander? You're staring...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Tomorrow's date isn't a reward. It's a request from me to you.<br>
I don't want to use an off-handed comment to disguise that.<br>
As my secretary ship, you've helped me both with work and with my life and health.<br>
It's only natural for your Commander to try to repay you a little.<br>
If there's anything you want to do tomorrow, I'd appreciate it if you let me know in advance.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">San Jacinto：</span><br>
Huh...?<br>
<br>
I'm not sure if it's just my imagination, but San Jacinto's ears look a touch pinker.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">San Jacinto：</span><br>
Mmmnh...<br>
Th-this is... so sudden...<br>
Is that your plan, Commander? Turning my request back around on me is so unfair♪<br>
Not that I like you any less because of it...<br>
<br>
Now her cheeks and even neck are flushed. I wasn't imagining it after all.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">San Jacinto：</span><br>
I'm very excited for tomorrow's date... Com-man-der♪<br>

<br>
The Secret to Curing Exhaustion?!<br>
<br>
6 Is the Secret Dates?<br>
The next morning, I get to our arranged meeting spot before San Jacinto.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Normally, she arrives first. Looks like it's my turn this time...)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">???：</span><br>
Commander!<br>
<br>
A pleasant voice reaches my ears. I rush to turn around, but a slender finger touches my cheek.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">San Jacinto：</span><br>
I can't believe you got here before me for once, Commander♪<br>
Should I assume you were even more excited for the date than I was?<br>
Heehee~ I finally get to have you all to myself for a day♪<br>
Where do you plan to take me first, hmm?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Have you had breakfast already?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">San Jacinto：</span><br>
Not yet. After all, I left my entire schedule for the day in your hands~<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Then how about we go check out a dessert shop?<br>
You did say that good food is the secret to curing exhaustion, as I recall.<br>
Let's energize ourselves at the very first stop.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">San Jacinto：</span><br>
Wow, you remember that...<br>
Do you actually care a lot about the things I say, Commander?<br>
Okay, let's go to the dessert shop~ Just leave ordering to me!<br>
<br>
On San Jacinto's recommendation, I order us a strawberry parfait.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">San Jacinto：</span><br>
Eat up! This strawberry parfait is the best~<br>
Come on. Open up!<br>
<br>
She feeds me a spoonful of parfait. The sweetness of it fills my mouth while her own sweet scent reaches my nose.<br>
Sweet food, sweet smells – it becomes hard to tell which is hers and which isn't.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">San Jacinto：</span><br>
Just one bite, and you feel all relaxed already... Isn't that right?<br>
<br>
She's right. The sugar soothes my tired nerves, making me feel a lot better all at once.<br>
We finish the strawberry parfait together.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">San Jacinto：</span><br>
That was delicious~ Even more so because I got to enjoy it with you, Commander.<br>
It's a little late to mention it now, but you and I were using the same spoon. That's like an indirect kiss, isn't it?<br>
Heehee~ Embarrassed yet?<br>
If you don't answer, I'm going to assume that's a yes~ Heheheh♪<br>
<br>
Next, we go to a movie theater together.<br>
Like our last destination, I pick the spot and have her choose what we do.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Hm? A horror movie?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">San Jacinto：</span><br>
Yeah~ Do you struggle with horror movies, Commander?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：If it's JUST a normal horror movie, then I'm fine.</span>'''''<br>
Then I can't wait to see how you react to this one~<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：A little, maybe...</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">San Jacinto：</span><br>
Don't you worry. I'll be right by your side~<br>
<br>
As the movie goes on, the eerie background audio suddenly rises to a crescendo.<br>
The horrifying scenes gradually suck me into the story.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">San Jacinto：</span><br>
Ah...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
What's wrong?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">San Jacinto：</span><br>
Commander, did that scare you?<br>
Look how hard you're holding on to my arm~<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Sorry... Did that hurt?<br>
I just got so absorbed in the movie, I didn't notice.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">San Jacinto：</span><br>
It's okay~ In fact... I might be happier that you did it♪<br>
<br>
She leans over and rests her head on my chest.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">San Jacinto：</span><br>
Your heartbeat is so fast~<br>
Is it because of the scary movie? Ooor...<br>
<br>
In the darkness, she whispers in my ear before gently kissing my neck.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">San Jacinto：</span><br>
Am I just imagining it?<br>
<br>
My heartbeat gets even more intense.<br>
After that, we go to an amusement park together.<br>
Naturally, I once again decide the destination and let her lead the way while we're there.<br>
We decide to ride the Ferris wheel together.<br>
The cabin gradually rises, and the scenery before us widens.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">San Jacinto：</span><br>
You don't get to see sights like this every day...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Do you like things like this?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">San Jacinto：</span><br>
Of course~<br>
Especially because you're by my side. It makes everything look even prettier than usual...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Than usual?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">San Jacinto：</span><br>
Oh? Let me say it again~<br>
Because you're here with me, I get to see things in an even more beautiful light than when you're not.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
If you're having fun, then let's go see more sights after this.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">San Jacinto：</span><br>
Huh...?<br>
Geez. That made my heart beat even faster than when we were watching the horror movie.<br>
Heehee... Would you like to hear it?<br>
<br>
Before I can answer, San Jacinto reaches an arm around my head and pulls me close to her heart.<br>
My ear touches her soft chest, and I hear her heart pounding within.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">San Jacinto：</span><br>
Commander...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
What's wrong?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">San Jacinto：</span><br>
I love...<br>
<br>
BOOM!<br>
The sound of a firework, vibrant and beautiful, cuts off San Jacinto's words.<br>
Eventually, our ride ends.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
What were you saying on the Ferris wheel before? I couldn't really hear you over the fireworks...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">San Jacinto：</span><br>
Aww~ You couldn't? That's a shame...<br>
If you didn't hear me...<br>
<br>
She suddenly stops in front of me, turns around, and winks.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">San Jacinto：</span><br>
Then I guess it remains a secret♡<br>

The Secret to Curing Exhaustion?!<br>
<br>
7 Is the Secret the Commander?<br>
Our last stop of the day is an aquarium.<br>
There, I let San Jacinto take the lead again.<br>
The aquarium at night has a different charm compared to daytime. At first, things proceed without incident...<br>
Until we reach the dolphin show, that is.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I didn't think they'd splash water at us...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">San Jacinto：</span><br>
SS Commander has been sunk~<br>
Here's a towel. Dry up nice and quick, okay?<br>
...Oh. A little towel isn't enough, is it?<br>
That's too bad. Let's get those clothes off of you, Commander~<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
R-right here? Now?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">San Jacinto：</span><br>
Yes, of course. You don't have to worry. I brought you a change of clothes just in case~<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Huh? Where were you keeping that towel and those clothes, exactly...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">San Jacinto：</span><br>
Must you interrogate everything? A girl's gotta have her secrets♪<br>
<br>
In the end, I change into the clothes she brought for me.<br>
Though it's a little distracting when she squeals from excitement the whole time...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(She does seem like she's more energetic now...)<br>
(I guess the date was a success, then?)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">San Jacinto：</span><br>
Heehee. I'm just so happy to have had you all to myself today.<br>
But I think there's one last thing I need to get rid of the rest of my fatigue.<br>
Commander, do you remember when you promised to give me a reward?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I sure do. Did you decide on something?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">San Jacinto：</span><br>
Of course. Close your eyes first.<br>
<br>
I close my eyes as directed. My other senses become slightly more acute.<br>
Warm breath caresses my cheek.<br>
A soft kiss touches my lips.<br>
A damp, gentle, but mischievous little kiss – a real one that suits her.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">San Jacinto：</span><br>
You can open your eyes now~ Heehee, all I ever need to cure my exhaustion... is you, Commander.<br>
<br>
She stands on her tiptoes and gently lays her head on my shoulder, breathing just a little heavily.<br>
When I look over, I see red in the corner of her eyes. Tears seem ready to flow.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">San Jacinto：</span><br>
Aquariums are a staple for dates, yes, but making them the last stop?<br>
I think you need to understand women's hearts a little better, Commander.<br>
Thank you for leading the way today. Now you can leave it to me.<br>
After all, our little promise from before still hasn't been fulfilled.<br>
<br>
With a sly grin, San Jacinto takes my hand and guides me to the aquarium exit.<br>
