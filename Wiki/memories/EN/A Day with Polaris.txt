One day, with Polaris...<br>
<br>
One day, at rehearsal...<br>
This is a story of Polaris, not long after they were formed...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Admiral Hipper μ：</span><br>
Let's get today's practice session underway!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cleveland μ：</span><br>
Yeah!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Admiral Hipper μ：</span><br>
Why do I only hear Cleveland? Where are the rest of you?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gascogne μ：</span><br>
Query: What is the purpose of crying out in this situation?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi μ：</span><br>
Sigh... I'm afraid without my Commander here, I simply can't arouse my passions...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sheffield μ：</span><br>
Forgive me. I find it too humiliating.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Admiral Hipper μ：</span><br>
Aaaagh! You're all impossible! How did I get stuck with you lot?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
...and that's the story nya! We're gonna need you to do some proper music band rehearsing type stuff nya!<br>
Brand new band, Polaris, doing their first group rehearsal nya! Got a real ring to it nya! Break a leg nya! Commander's rooting for you too nya!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cleveland μ：</span><br>
When I agreed to do testing on new experimental equipment, I never thought it meant joining a band.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sheffield μ：</span><br>
I certainly never thought they would put us together in such a... motley crew.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cleveland μ：</span><br>
You know, I think it shows the Commander's thoughtfulness~ to put us all together like this, all from different camps, and letting us shine. It's nice.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi μ：</span><br>
Well, if my Commander wishes it, I suppose I can muster up some motivation.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gascogne μ：</span><br>
Directives received. Switching functionalities.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Admiral Hipper μ：</span><br>
Now... I don't actually know where to begin...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cleveland μ：</span><br>
Anywhere's good, right~ Let's try this: the first song, "cœur." Ready? One, two, three...<br>
<br>
And so, with a little hope and a lot of unease, the newly formed group, Polaris, practiced their hearts out...<br>

<br>
One day, with Polaris...<br>
<br>
One day, during a break...<br>
One day, after rehearsal...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cleveland μ：</span><br>
Phew... what do you say we call it a day?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sheffield μ：</span><br>
Yes, there are limits to both time and stamina...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Admiral Hipper μ：</span><br>
If that's how you feel, then I suppose we can take a break... But it's not like I'm tired or anything.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gascogne μ：</span><br>
Observation: Hipper is in an abnormal state. Current Condition: Exhausted.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Admiral Hipper μ：</span><br>
Haah?! Wh- who's exhausted?! I barely even broke a sweat!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi μ：</span><br>
Hehe, another day of hard work complete~ I think it's time to visit my Commander for a well-earned reward!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Admiral Hipper μ：</span><br>
I'm a little curious what exactly you think that reward will be... Actually, I'd rather not hear the details...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cleveland μ：</span><br>
Since we're done for the day, I'll go get us some drinks. Who wants what? Oxy-Colas? Coolant?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gascogne μ：</span><br>
Gascogne requires coolant.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sheffield μ：</span><br>
Tea... Actually, let me accompany you. Serving drinks is in fact a maid's duty.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Admiral Hipper μ：</span><br>
I've heard you Royal Maids struggle under the yoke of a very strict Head Maid, eh...? In any case, I'll have a coffee.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi μ：</span><br>
I can't believe you Iron Bloods actually pour that filthy swill into your mouths... Hehe, I'd like tea. One of your splendid Royal Maids' teas.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Admiral Hipper μ：</span><br>
Haah?! Coffee is the choice of a refined lady!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sheffield μ：</span><br>
Here we go again.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cleveland μ：</span><br>
Ahahaha... it's nice to see Hipper and Akagi getting along.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Admiral Hipper μ：</span><br>
Haah?! Who the hell would get along with HER?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi μ：</span><br>
Hehe... Since it has nothing to do with my Commander, I suppose I can let you have it. Just don't let me see you slurping down your coffee and we won't have a problem~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sheffield μ：</span><br>
I will fetch your beverages then. Kindly wait a moment.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cleveland μ：</span><br>
Hey, I'm coming too! Gotta get me an Oxy-Cola on the way~<br>
<br>
And so, the Polaris girls grew another day closer after a long practice session...<br>

Azur Anthem - Side Story<br>
<br>
4 Lessons<br>
One day, on the port's temporary stage...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Denver：</span><br>
Wow... Cleveland looks so cool up there onstage!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Montpelier：</span><br>
Big sis... is incredible...!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Belfast：</span><br>
Sheffield... You have brought honour to the Royal Maids.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Edinburgh：</span><br>
Aww, I want to get out of work too! Err, I mean, I want to do something to bring honour to the Royal Maids too!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Oh...? Well done. I can't wait to see the real thing, "Dear Sister." Hehe♪<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kaga：</span><br>
The stage is yet another battlefield, Akagi. And I will watch your battle with great interest...!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cleveland μ：</span><br>
Hah... I never thought we'd draw a crowd like this. I'm actually getting a little nervous.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sheffield μ：</span><br>
And I never thought Belfast would come to this kind of show...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi μ：</span><br>
Hehehe... If I treat it as a special performance, just for my Commander, I can do great things~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Admiral Hipper μ：</span><br>
Phew...<br>
All that practicing was enough... Why do we have to get up on stage and do it again?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gascogne μ：</span><br>
Initial performance... Gascogne: physical parameters abnormal. Is this... "excitement?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cleveland μ：</span><br>
Stage fright and excitement go hand in hand. That's the thrill of a live performance!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sheffield μ：</span><br>
You seem quite knowledgeable, Cleveland.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Admiral Hipper μ：</span><br>
Aaagh! Fine! Here we go!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gascogne μ：</span><br>
Executing song number one: "cœur."<br>
<br>
And so began Polaris's first onstage performance...<br>
