Red Spider Lily's Love<br>
<br>
Chapter 1 - The Secretary in Red<br>
Port - Office<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
I brought the documents you'll need for your next meeting, Commander. Yes, I left them there as usual. Please go over them when you have the time.<br>
That said, I've already examined them very thoroughly, of course. You don't even need to inspect any silly paperwork, I can deal with anything you wish...<br>
... Ah, it must be because you're worried about overworking me~! You make me feel so happy, Commander~<br>
<br>
(Knock knock)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
Commander, I'm here to report on the exercises we had a while back.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Gah! I-it's you, Enterprise...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
Oh, it's you, Akagi...<br>
<br>
Akagi gently clenched her fist. Suddenly, the mood in the office was getting tense...<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Try to soften the mood</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：Watch Akagi to see what she'll do</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Commander... Hmph. Enterprise, seeing as we're on the same side now. If you're here to report to the Commander then would you please get on with it?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Yeah, no need to tell me...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Grrrrrrrrrrrrrr...<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''It felt like the whole office was shaking, almost like an earthquake...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
That's all I've got. I don't want to overstay my welcome, so I'll be taking my leave now.<br>
<br>
(Thud)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Phew... Commander, you need not worry. Despite my reputation, I know how to keep my private and work lives separate. I would never do anything that might disrupt your work.<br>
Right! Akagi will deal with that pest later and make you mine... but here in the office... Aka—I will stay calm, okay?<br>

Chapter 2 - The Unrivaled Legends<br>
Noon - Exercise Area<br>
The sound of planes swooping through the air intermingles with the sounds of ships being bombed and subsequently exploding.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hiryuu：</span><br>
*Pant*... *Pant*... Don't you think she's being a lot stricter than usual today...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Souryuu：</span><br>
She is... I wonder if something happened to upset Akagi. It's been a long time since we had a joint exercise this intense.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zuikaku：</span><br>
It's tough! But if we can overcome this, we'll be closer to matching our seniors in strength! ... Wait, Shoukaku, you okay?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shoukaku：</span><br>
Bad seniors, bad seniors, bad seniors, bad seniors, badseniorsbadseniorsbadseniors...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kaga：</span><br>
Don't waste your energy on chatter. Akagi is dead serious today. Stay focused or you'll learn how she got her nickname... You'll wish you were in hell.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hiryuu：</span><br>
Still, why did she arrange these joint exercises on such short notice... Do you know anything, Kaga?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kaga：</span><br>
I don't know the full story either, but apparently, the Eagle Union got better results than we did during an exercise a while ago.<br>
Akagi was giving it everything she had, too. Enough talk, it's time for you to amuse me... *Cackling*...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Is that the best you can do...? And you call yourselves part of the Sakura Empire's carrier divisions?!<br>
... Oh, you're here, Commander? *Giggle*, you've seen the unsightly side of me... I beg your forgiveness.<br>
But please listen... This is not because I bear a personal grudge, I'm doing this for the 1st Carrier Division's sake... Or, rather, the Sakura Empire's sake...<br>
It's because of hard work like this that we used to be known as "The Unrivaled Ones" in the war.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kaga：</span><br>
Akagi, everyone's lined up. And Commander, they might not look like much, but they're giving it everything they have and then some for this exercise. Don't feel bad for them.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
... Now then, Commander, I must resume the joint exercise. If you wish to watch us, then please have a seat over here. *Giggle*~<br>

<br>
Chapter 3 - Love Rivals and... Exceptions?<br>
Noon - Shopping District<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Ahh, how wonderful, I get to spend my day off shopping with you, Commander... *Giggle*~<br>
<br>
Akagi was cheerfully swinging around her shopping bag as she walked alongside me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Are you tired, Commander...? Please, you're only human, you needn't pretend to be stronger than you are... I will carry your bags for you~<br>
<br>
After saying that, Akagi took the shopping bags out of my hands. Actually, since she brought it up...<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：(... I might be a bit tired, mentally speaking.)</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
*Giggle*... You filthy little insect, are you trying to steal the Commander from Akagi!? That will be the last mistake you ever— Commander? Why are you stopping Akagi?<br>
You just stared at that girl, didn't you? Why won't you stare at Akagi? Akagi thought we were supposed to be shopping together? Are you saying that girl has seduced you? Akagi will have to dispose of her later...<br>
Taih— That wench is right behind us! One day Akagi will end her, Akagi swears it...!<br>
Ah, it was nothing, Commander! Please keep your eyes on Akagi and don't look behind you~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kaga：</span><br>
Hello, bootl... *Ahem*, Akagi. I suppose you're shopping with the Commander.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Yes. Would you care to join us?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kaga：</span><br>
I'm... Sorry, I'll pass. It's your day off with the Commander and I wouldn't want to be a third wheel.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Now, now, don't worry about that. I'm fine sharing the Commander with you. You certainly don't mind either, right, Commander?<br>
<br>
Akagi forcefully drew Kaga by her hand over to my side.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kaga：</span><br>
Akagi... I would much rather not...<br>
<br>
... And so, Akagi, Kaga, and I enjoyed our day of peaceful (in some sense, anyway) shopping.<br>

<br>
Chapter 4 - Allies and Days of Old<br>
One day - At an Iron Blood-Sakura Empire party<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Ah, you must be...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Graf Zeppelin：</span><br>
Graf Zeppelin. How unexpected to find you of all at a gathering of this kind.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
I came on a whim. Besides, someone has to look after the kids. That's why you're here, no?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Graf Zeppelin：</span><br>
... That, I can't deny. Perhaps it's because my design was based on yours... We are similar not just in strength, but in these matters as well.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
You simply must fight alongside me next time. Having another Akagi around is reassuring.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Graf Zeppelin：</span><br>
... By the way, I was rather taken aback when I heard you joined us instead of that "God."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
True. Had I not met the Commander, I would likely have stayed with "God."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Graf Zeppelin：</span><br>
It was back in Midway... You and the Commander reenacted that legendary battle there.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Continuing the war, hurting your allies, and searching for beings with the potential to Awaken, all just to get your hands on that abhorrent power...<br>
That "me" who followed "God"... whether she's real or not is just a possibility.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Graf Zeppelin：</span><br>
A "possibility"...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
We are 2 sides of the same coin... Born of the same stuff, my own existence is also a "possibility."<br>
The moment I met you in battle, that too was a "possibility" of sorts. As is my sitting here enjoying a nice cold beer with you...<br>
All because of the "possibility" that I met the Commander who freed me from the "Sirens."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Graf Zeppelin：</span><br>
... Hm... And does the Commander know that?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
The day will come when he understands.<br>
Our existence, "Sanctuary," "Soul," and the "Original..."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Graf Zeppelin：</span><br>
Right... now I'm afraid you've lost me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Hehe... seems I've gone and gotten myself a bit tipsy...<br>
<br>
Let's take this conversation someplace a bit quieter.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Regardless, I'm sure the Commander will love me... *Giggle*<br>

<br>
Chapter 5 - A Small Scar<br>
Port - Canteen Kitchen<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
I'm sorry it's come to this. Our designated cook called in sick today... I will make her pay dearly for causing you so much trouble, Commander...<br>
On second thought, though, I should be thanking her for giving me the chance to cook together with you~! *Giggle*... Kaga would've simply done everything on her own, so I am the only one who gets to experience this...<br>
Ahh... You look magnificent when you cook, Commander... I can't help but swoon just watching you...<br>
<br>
Akagi was staring at me so intently... I got distracted and cut my finger.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Commander?! Your finger, it's...!<br>
How could this happen... Did someone tamper with the knife?! Or are there people in here trying to distract you...?!<br>
This will not do. I've taken measures to ensure no one can sneak into the office, but I overlooked the canteen as you don't come here often...<br>
I cannot be by your side around the clock, so I'll need to ask someone for help... No, no, she might use that as an excuse to share your bed...<br>
Ah, I've got it! I'll just chain you to your bed so that we will never be apart... I'll ask Akashi to make— No, I'll even make the chains myself!<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Use a bandage to cover the wound</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：Tell Akagi that you're fine</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Commander, what do you mean by that?! Are you saying you don't need my help? You're not actually considering asking others for help when you have me, are you...?!<br>
*Grr* ... If you're going to act tough and ignore what Akagi says, then you leave Akagi no choice...<br>
<br>
Then, in the blink of an eye, everything went black.<br>
I tried to move, and a fluffy sensation ran over my whole body...<br>
It seemed she had enveloped me with her tails to prevent me from going anywhere.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Don't even think about running away. No matter what you believe, nobody loves you more than Akagi does... *Giggle*<br>
<br>
Trapped inside her mass of tails, Akagi and I were alone.<br>

Chapter 6 - Confession in The Dark<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
All you had to do was listen to Akagi... It's not a good idea to make Akagi sad...<br>
Because, when you do... this happens...<br>
<br>
Akagi crept closer to me as she spoke. Then...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Mmmph... *Lick*...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
... Wha...!?<br>
<br>
Akagi put my bleeding finger into her mouth.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
I would never, ever hurt you, Commander. Even if you made an enemy of me, I wouldn't.<br>
However, when you've been hurt, only I am allowed to care for you.<br>
You must understand there are some things only I can do... Not anybody else, not even Kaga...<br>
<br>
The tip of my finger felt vaguely chilly.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
You needn't think about or do anything. I will take care of everything for you.<br>
Commander... close your eyes, and leave everything to me.<br>
<br>
No matter how many times I've heard her say that many times before, I could feel the seriousness in her tone.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Close your eyes</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：Tell Akagi you want her to depend on you</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''......<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''You mean... you'll depend on me, and I'll depend on you...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Which means... you want to care for me, too... is that it?<br>
<br>
(Nod)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Oh, Commander...<br>
<br>
Akagi held me tight.<br>

Chapter 7 - My Soulmate<br>
"I wanted to save the people I care about."<br>
"It was for the sake of those I couldn't save, and to go beyond the barrier of my memories."<br>
"And to do that, I would do anything, even if it meant asking God for help..."<br>
"But now, that is all in the past... Because now, I've found my soulmate; I've found the person I was destined to be with."<br>
I felt a kiss on my cheek, then woke up. Apparently, I had fallen asleep in Akagi's lap.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Commander, did you sleep well? Dear me, for you to fall asleep like that... You must have been feeling very worn out lately...<br>
I didn't do anything while you were asleep. As long as you accept me, I am happy...<br>
If you say you don't wish to look at me, then that is fine... If you say you won't be mine... then that, too, is fine.<br>
All I'm asking is that you never, ever forget my love for you, Commander...<br>
... You really are an incredibly kind person, Commander...<br>
<br>
Then, I could hear people calling out for me.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Tell Akagi it's time to get going</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Of course. We should start heading out.<br>
Please look after me, the fleet, and the whole Sakura Empire.<br>
I pray God may watch over you, Commander... the one... I was fated to be with...<br>
