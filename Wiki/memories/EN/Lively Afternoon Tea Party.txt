Lively Afternoon Tea Party I<br>
<br>
「Ladies At 3 O’Clock」<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:13}：</span><br>
Ding Dong~ Let’s begin our afternoon tea party!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Edinburgh：</span><br>
Wait a minute, before we start I have a question. Why are we holding a tea party?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:13}：</span><br>
Typical, a Royal Navy maid wishes to know of our intentions? The reason is—— only meant for adults to know!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:14}：</span><br>
We're holding a tea party for all those hard working sisters out in the cold in order to warm them up. So no matter how tired everyone gets, {namecode:14} will be here to greet everyone with a pot of hot tea!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
I hope I get an opportunity to help everyone relax. What’s more, some sisters are just constantly staying in their rooms lately...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:13}：</span><br>
{namecode:13} is not always staying in her room, {namecode:13} is merely just… hibernating! Yes, {namecode:13} is hibernating.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:14}：</span><br>
...Sister, you’re always telling half-truths, who’s going to believe you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
If you're always hiding in dark places with no light, then I'll get worried...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:13}：</span><br>
Naturally, {namecode:13} has got lamps in her room, so not to worry!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:14}：</span><br>
...Illustrious, besides {namecode:13}, where are those other introverted sisters?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
Are you referring to the one from the Northern Parliament? Unfortunately, she is still a little shy to attend...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Belfast：</span><br>
Just wait until winter, we’ll lure her out with a snowman.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:14}：</span><br>
And… Miss. Hood is not coming as well?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Belfast：</span><br>
She and Prince of Wales were given a rare day off, so likely she won't have time to attend this tea party.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Edinburgh：</span><br>
Ok, if I may interrupt this chit-chat, let’s get everyone to taste the traditional afternoon tea from the Sakura Empire.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:14}：</span><br>
Please have a try of {namecode:13}'s signature dish.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
O, I’ve been highly anticipating this~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Royal Navy：</span><br>
… O my, this taste——!!!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Edinburgh：</span><br>
—— Why is this so bitter! My eyes are getting watery! There must be some kind of dark chocolate inside!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
Hmm… so this is what matcha tastes like. It really is a unique flavour~<br>
Huh, {namecode:11} did not come? She shouldn’t be on a mission today, right?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:14}：</span><br>
Sister...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:13}：</span><br>
—— She left a note and then headed out!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
A note?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:11}：</span><br>
I won't attend this tea party without {namecode:12}!... {namecode:12}, just wait, I'll definitely come get you!<br>

<br>
Lively Afternoon Tea Party II<br>
<br>
「A Queen Afraid of Loneliness」<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Edinburgh：</span><br>
Thank goodness Belfast brought black tea...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Belfast：</span><br>
As a maid of the Royal Navy, having tea on-hand is a given.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Edinburgh：</span><br>
(Bites lip) I’m also a maid, so, so… tea should be a must-have?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:14}：</span><br>
After tasting the bitterness of matcha, I will cherish even more the sweetness of other foods.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
Having black tea after tasting matcha tea, what an opportunity to compare the two flavours.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:13}：</span><br>
{namecode:13} also wants to try the black tea prepared by Belfast!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">???：</span><br>
Wait, wait for me——!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Hey, all of you didn’t care to invite me to this tea party!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
Hmm, didn't your Majesty once say to me, “As Queen, I have a tremendous amount of tasks and responsibilities, how can I possibly spend time with you commoners!”<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
But, but everyone is gone and I am all alone. It’s very.... Wait, are you telling me I'm not welcomed here!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Belfast：</span><br>
Of course you're welcome here~ You honour us with your presence. The fact that your Majesty can take time out of your busy schedule to join us for this tea party makes me feel privileged~ Please take a seat your Majesty.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Come to think of it, Belfast you failed in your duties! I told you last night before bed to wake me up this morning! I ended up sleeping until noon, it’s all your fault!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Belfast：</span><br>
Yes of course your Majesty, I failed in my duties as maid to wake you from your sleep. I will take to heart this dereliction of duty as a serious offense——<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
No matter, if you’ll tell me bedtime stories every night henceforth then I shall forgive you. I slept a little late last night indeed. So, where’s my tea?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Edinburgh：</span><br>
Here~ this tea was especially prepared for you by the Sakura Empire. I hope that your Majesty likes it~<br>
<br>
At the same time, {namecode:11}...<br>
[North Latitude 34° East Longitude 140°]<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:11}：</span><br>
A single person alone can be a bit… but——Ninja {namecode:11} will never give up even if I'm facing danger alone! Here I come, Northern Parliament!<br>

<br>
Lively Afternoon Tea Party III<br>
<br>
「Dawn, Love To Sleep In...」<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Belfast：</span><br>
Your Majesty, it’s time to wake up~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Zzzz…...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Belfast：</span><br>
(Leans close to Queen Elizabeth’s ear) Today’s breakfast is your favourite buttered toast~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Moan... Give me a moment... Zzzz...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Belfast：</span><br>
If you continue to sleep, then I'm afraid you'll be eating breakfast alone your Majesty.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
...Belfast... Will accompany me... Zzzz<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Belfast：</span><br>
It really can't be helped... your Majesty, there will be a new sister arriving today~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Zzzz... A new girl... Really?! Do I know her... My head hurts... Belfast... Help me get up...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Belfast：</span><br>
...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
...Belfast?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Belfast：</span><br>
...Sorry, I lied, there is no one coming, you can sleep a little longer your Majesty.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
...Is that so... well then... Zzzz<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Belfast：</span><br>
I'm simply advising you to not work all night long… Your Majesty should rest a little longer… Argh, I'm such a careless maid, I forgot to wake up the Queen this morning (smiles).<br>
Hmm… we still got some time left, let me enjoy glancing at your Majesty’s face while you sleep for another 10 minutes more~<br>
Hehe~ That sleeping face your Majesty makes is so cute~<br>
<br>
Back at the tea party——<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:13}：</span><br>
This snack is delicious, who made this?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Edinburgh：</span><br>
...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Belfast：</span><br>
My sister made these, scones are her speciality.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Oh? I thought you made them, Belfast. Both of you make very similar tea and snacks.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Edinburgh：</span><br>
Hehehehe….<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Belfast：</span><br>
Haha, I'll take that as a compliment.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:14}：</span><br>
This snack tastes… how should I put it—— right. You can taste all love and effort from you sisters.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:13}：</span><br>
{namecode:14}, don't look at me that way, enough I get it already, I'll learn how to bake scones the way Edinburgh makes it—— Even though I might not be able to make it as tasty.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:14}：</span><br>
It’s ok, I can wait, not matter how long it takes for you to learn to bake this!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Edinburgh：</span><br>
...<br>
<br>
At the same time, {namecode:11}...<br>
[North Latitude 28° East Longitude 167°]<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:11}：</span><br>
Should the northern side of the Sakura Empire be this warm… might be caused by greenhouse effects, scary!<br>

<br>
Lively Afternoon Tea Party IV<br>
<br>
「Noon, Beloved Belfast!」<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Edinburgh：</span><br>
Argh.... darn it, I failed again! I obviously sprinkled just a bit more than I should've, but why is it so sweet!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Belfast：</span><br>
You left your key on the table while heading out, I brought it for you here, sister.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Edinburgh：</span><br>
K-Key? Ahh! Thank you so much Belfast...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Belfast：</span><br>
Are you making scones again sis? How is it this time?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Edinburgh：</span><br>
Sigh, have a taste yourself——<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Belfast：</span><br>
...The sugar is not evenly spread out...You didn't mix the sugar when you sprinkled it in, right? Also, I think the temperature was a bit too high...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Edinburgh：</span><br>
Sigh… as sisters, how come the gap between our talents is wide...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Belfast：</span><br>
You're being too hard on yourself sis, there are plenty of things that you do better than me...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Edinburgh：</span><br>
Really?! Like what???<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Belfast：</span><br>
Like I'm going to tell you, you'll have to find that out yourself~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Edinburgh：</span><br>
Tell me, Belfast~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Belfast：</span><br>
N - O, NO<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Edinburgh：</span><br>
Hmph——<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Belfast：</span><br>
As for the snacks for the tea party… as usual, just leave that to me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Edinburgh：</span><br>
I don't want to rely on you forever, Belfast… If only I could be more like you...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Belfast：</span><br>
The most important thing a person should not do is try and be like someone else, so just be yourself. Besides, I'm not worthy of your admiration...<br>
In short, you should live the way you always have sister. Leave the hard work of being the perfect maid to me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Edinburgh：</span><br>
Really... hehe~ Belfast, I love you sis!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Belfast：</span><br>
Really now? Rushing over to hug me while I’m cracking eggs….<br>
<br>
At the same time, {namecode:11}...<br>
[North Latitude 21° West Longitude 158°]<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:11}：</span><br>
It's getting hotter and hotter, my clothes are all soaked... Must be because I ran too much! A route sign ahead, Honolulu? What does this mean? No matter, as long as I keep on moving forward!<br>

Lively Afternoon Tea Party V<br>
<br>
「Afternoon Nap Time」<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
Say, how do you all spend your afternoon?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ikazuchi：</span><br>
Play video——<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Inazuma：</span><br>
Sister, if you're always staying in your room and not showing your face in port, everyone will start to forget you. In the end, even the color of your portrait in the "Archives menu" will start to fade.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ikazuchi：</span><br>
Is this the so-called “social death”? ...so, so scary...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
It’s nice to be with friends whenever you’re on break.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ikazuchi：</span><br>
Is that so, no, no matter, {namecode:13} is also my friend!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
Really?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ikazuchi：</span><br>
Of course! {namecode:37}, {namecode:24}, {namecode:15} are all my friends.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Inazuma：</span><br>
If I remember correctly, aren't you all members of the “Afternoon Nap” club.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
“Afternoon Nap” club?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ikazuchi：</span><br>
Well, well... in the “Afternoon Nap” club we all gather, hold hands and close our eyes. We'll nap inside during the brightest part of the day.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
That sounds interesting, when’s the next time you all are doing this again? Can I also join you?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Inazuma：</span><br>
...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">？？？：</span><br>
I knew it, there you are, your Majesty!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Ark Royal? Why are you here?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ark Royal：</span><br>
Because my afternoon was... um, very busy!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Don’t tell me you… again?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ark Royal：</span><br>
During noon time, the sunlight was shining slightly westward. Those cute destroyer girls were all lining up and transporting supplies along the routes—— These dangerous operations must have extra protection to guard the cargo! As a new aircraft carrier with the best reconnaissance and long-range strike capabilities, I, Ark Royal, am compelled to go!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Inazuma：</span><br>
In other words, you followed them?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ark Royal：</span><br>
Of course not! I was merely worried about attacks from hostile forces!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Isn’t the transport route completely cleared of hostiles by now?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ark Royal：</span><br>
Even so, we musn’t rule out the possibility of their return! And, and... What if those destroyers get lost! What if they lose track of the time while playing and forgot to come home, or what if they encounter a typhoon! Out there in the depths of the ocean, the only thing they can rely on is my swordfishes！<br>
“Thank you, thank you, Ark Royal, for saving me, without you I just wouldn't know what to do… can we call you sister from this day forward?”...“Sister Ark Royal, I'm cold…”, ...“Thank you, sister Ark Royal, umm, umm, I like you the most!”<br>
Heh~heh~heh<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Edinburgh：</span><br>
Ark Royal, please wake up.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Belfast：</span><br>
That being the case, why are you here at the tea party?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ark Royal：</span><br>
Because I heard that your Majesty was here, although I did not anticipate that you would be here Belfast...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Belfast：</span><br>
In all honesty, it’s better if you were a bit further away from her Majesty.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
(Angry) The both of you better listen carefully to what I'm about to say. I am not a destroyer!<br>
<br>
At the same time, {namecode:11}...<br>
[South Latitude 2° West Longitude 139°]<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:11}：</span><br>
N-not there yet… I'm already so exhausted… {namecode:12} is constantly living in such harsh environments... {namecode:12}, I'll be there soon!<br>

Lively Afternoon Tea Party VI<br>
<br>
「The Elegant Bluff」<br>
A few days prior to the tea party.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hood：</span><br>
Cygnet, what are you and Edinburgh doing? Your faces are all dirty, come here and let me wipe off the dirt.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cygnet：</span><br>
Ack! Ah! That...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Edinburgh：</span><br>
We are adding tea leaves to our baked sweet potatoes, do you want to try, Hood?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hood：</span><br>
Baked sweet potatoes? Can I have a taste?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cygnet：</span><br>
Umm, the food prepared at my home tastes far worse than those snacks prepared by Belfast, and...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Edinburgh：</span><br>
Hood, this was freshly roasted.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cygnet：</span><br>
W-wait! Let us go wash them first...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hood：</span><br>
You didn't wash it before you eat it? That’s alright, just enjoy its original flavour.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cygnet：</span><br>
That, umm, those all got dirty...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hood：</span><br>
Hmm? Your hands will get stained, but this is part of the enjoyment of eating this dish. Cygnet, you didn’t….<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cygnet：</span><br>
… So, umm, how does it taste?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hood：</span><br>
Yes… very delicious, the sweetness is just right.~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cygnet：</span><br>
R-really? We thought that peeling sweet potatoes would be below what the eloquent Hood would tolerate to do.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hood：</span><br>
(Laughs) Who exactly do you think I am? If peeling sweet potatoes is below me, then that kind of eloquence—— must be some kind of bluff.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Edinburgh：</span><br>
That’s right, that’s right! Hood, let me teach you how to roast them.~<br>
Belfast is so busy she refused to come out to roast sweet potatoes! Honestly, if only she can be as understanding as you are——<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hood：</span><br>
Miss Belfast, she has too many things tied to her kind heart...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Edinburgh：</span><br>
Really? As her sister, I cannot tell.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hood：</span><br>
Most likely because whenever Miss Belfast is around you, she is most relaxed.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Edinburgh：</span><br>
Really… hehe, it really can't be helped. I guess I'll take some sweet potatoes home for her——<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cygnet：</span><br>
Umm… quickly eat them, when they get cold they'll taste not as good...<br>
<br>
Back to the tea party——<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ark Royal：</span><br>
Slowly but surely, the fallen leaves are beginning to pile up in the courtyard...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
After all, autumn is the season of fallen leaves.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ikazuchi：</span><br>
The fall… naturally a good time to gather with everyone. Let’s all roast some sweet potatoes!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Edinburgh：</span><br>
Roast sweet potatoes? Edinburgh can finally show off her prowess!	<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Belfast：</span><br>
These are not a good match to be served for afternoon tea.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Inazuma：</span><br>
When no one is available to make food or go out to buy snacks for the tea party, then roasting sweet potatoes is the easiest option!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Edinburgh：</span><br>
Belfast, are you coming? Let’s gather up all the leaves and I will light up a bonfire.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Belfast：</span><br>
Hehe, all this smoke… really——<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Belfast, this looks fun, let’s join them!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Belfast：</span><br>
Our afternoon tea etiquette——<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Ha, this is called sharing happiness with commoners. On occasion, we should mingle and do what the common folk are doing.~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Edinburgh：</span><br>
Your Majesty, let me teach you how to roast these.~<br>
<br>
At the same time, {namecode:11}...<br>
[South Latitude 71° West Longitude 100°]<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:11}：</span><br>
A continent covered in snow… The map is reliable as expected. This is the Northern Parliament! {namecode:12}, rest assured, I am here to get you!<br>

Lively Afternoon Tea Party VII<br>
<br>
「Next Time: Video Game Party!」<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Edinburgh：</span><br>
Come and try some, Belfast~ Freshly roasted sweet potatoes~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Belfast：</span><br>
No, please don't force other people to eat food which they do not like!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Belfast, how come my roasted sweet potatoes turned into burnt lumps of coal? Sigh~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Belfast：</span><br>
Your Majesty, this being your first time roasting something, you already did a superb job.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
But when Belfast roasted hers for the first time...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Belfast：</span><br>
Well, your Majesty, let’s exchange our sweet potatoes then.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
The sweet potato roasted by Belfast tastes so good~ You should try your own cooking.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Belfast：</span><br>
...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Belfast, under the authority as your Queen, I order you to open your mouth, say ah——<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Belfast：</span><br>
I really have no choice....<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Edinburgh：</span><br>
You’re really wicked your Majesty, I want to feed Belfast as well!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:13}&{namecode:14}：</span><br>
……<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
Ahh, do you all went to be fed?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:13}：</span><br>
Sorry, please excuse, I never want to be——<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ark Royal：</span><br>
Ah, those sister destroyer ships have returned back to port. Sorry, I must take my leave~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:13}：</span><br>
And just like that she disappeared, those carriers from the Royal Navy are really unfathomable.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
Haha, another aircraft carrier here from the Royal Navy is still here.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:14}：</span><br>
After all this is an unfathomable place...<br>
