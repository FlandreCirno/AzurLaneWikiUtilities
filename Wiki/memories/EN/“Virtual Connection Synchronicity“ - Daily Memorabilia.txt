Chapter 1 - Garbage-Tier Genius AI<br>
Port - Plaza<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kizuna AI：</span><br>
HAI DOMO! Kizuna AI here!<br>
Today I’m coming to you from an alternate universe!<br>
So let’s go ahead and find a girl here in the Home Port to interview! Javelin, how goes it!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
Whaa!? Did I hear my name? And what’s with the cameras!? Oh noo! My clothes! My makeup! I’m not readyyy!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kizuna AI：</span><br>
Relax, relax! We can fix all of that in post! With the POWER OF SCIENCE!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ayanami：</span><br>
Science can do all that? This Super AI is kinda scaring me….<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
Now why are you here making videos all of a sudden anyway?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
Well, you see…<br>
<br>
30 minutes earlier…<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kizuna AI：</span><br>
Ayanami, what’cha lookin’ at?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ayanami：</span><br>
Just some let’s plays on this video site.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
…that’s all she ever does with her time off….<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kizuna AI：</span><br>
YOU GOT STREAMING VIDEOS IN THIS WORLD TOO!? Show me! SHOW MEEE!!!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ayanami：</span><br>
What’s got you all excited? You have this kind of stuff in your world, Ai?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kizuna AI：</span><br>
Do we ever! In fact, I make videos like this all by myself. I’m a VTuber. Kind of a big deal.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
No idea what that is but it sounds cool I guess.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kizuna AI：</span><br>
Hehehehee♪. So if you pull up my channel there…<br>
Wh- why isn’t it coming up!?<br>
Ohhh… of course you can’t see it from another universe.<br>
Well, I guess I got no choice but to make a new channel here in this world. And you’re all gonna help!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
…and that’s what happened.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
Right. And that’s why you’re here making videos.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kizuna AI：</span><br>
Preeeecisely! And I’m DEFINITELY gonna need everyone’s help to make the best videos I possibly can. DEFINITELY!<br>
So thank you all for volunteering!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Everyone：</span><br>
Whaaaaaa!?<br>

Chapter 2 - Do AIs Dream fo Electric Dolphins?<br>
??? - Ruined City<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ayanami：</span><br>
Woah... it's all bombed out buildings. That's pretty dark.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Long Island：</span><br>
Wahhh... this is the kind of place you'd have a real ghost pop out at you!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kizuna AI：</span><br>
Where are we...? And when did we change outfits!?<br>
<br>
OooooOOOoooo! OOOOoooOOooo!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kizuna AI：</span><br>
Aaaaaaaaaaa!!!!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Long Island：</span><br>
WAAAAAAAaaaaaaaahhh! What is that!? A ghost!? A monster!?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ikazuchi：</span><br>
Aieeeeee! These, these are those "zombies" I heard about!! *trembles*<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ayanami：</span><br>
Everybody calm down. There's some weapons over there we can take. This is how we survive...!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kizuna AI：</span><br>
How can you stay calm at a time like this!? I m-mean, roger!<br>
Here we go! SAY HELLO TO MY LITTLE FRIEND!!!<br>
<br>
*BAM BAM! RATATATATATATATAAA!!*<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ayanami：</span><br>
She got the hang of it pretty quick. And if she can do it, anyone can.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Long Island：</span><br>
Ehehehe... Unstoppable ghost over here! But I am a teensy bit tired so how about we take five in that research lab-looking building over there?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ayanami：</span><br>
Ah!? Look out, Long Island! There's something behind you!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Long Island：</span><br>
Say what?<br>
<br>
ROoooooOOOAAAaaar!!!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Long Island：</span><br>
AAAIEEEEEEEeeeee! What is it this time!?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ikazuchi：</span><br>
I figured it out. That's the "final boss" of this level, yeah?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kizuna AI：</span><br>
Huh?! It's just a video game boss? Ahahahahaa!<br>
And why would the last boss be here of all places?! We just got here!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Long Island：</span><br>
This is gonna be tough. I'm thinking just wailing on it with basic attacks won't do the trick!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kizuna AI：</span><br>
Hey! There's a ROCKET LAUNCHER over here!!<br>
Urk! It's so heavy!!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ayanami：</span><br>
We'll create a diversion. AI, do it! Pull the trigger!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kizuna AI：</span><br>
Got it! Here I go! WITNESS MEEEEEEEE!!!<br>
<br>
*KABOOOOOOOM*<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ayanami：</span><br>
Now we wait for the dust to clear to see if we won.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kizuna AI：</span><br>
Woah, Ayanami! Don't jinx us here....<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ikazuchi：</span><br>
I see how it is! That "Rocket Launcher" is the strongest weapon in the ga- AUGH!?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ayanami：</span><br>
Ikazuchi!? Wai- it's not dead yet. Look out!!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kizuna AI：</span><br>
AAAAAAAAAaaaaaaaa! It's a FLAAAAAAAAAAAAAG!!!<br>
<br>
GAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHH!!!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Long Island：</span><br>
Holy~ This is some hax over here!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kizuna AI：</span><br>
Ok- okay.... everyone's... everyone's gone....<br>
Umm... sorry, everybody. That one's on me.<br>
....hm?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">System Message：</span><br>
Continue?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：YES</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：NO</span>'''''<br>

Chapter 3 - Helloooo! San Diego Here♪!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">San Diego：</span><br>
Helloooo! San Diego here♪! *dingdingding*<br>
And today is my debut as a virtual idol!!!<br>
...like this, right?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kizuna AI：</span><br>
Yeah! That's just like a VTuber! I've had my eyes on you from the beginning and I've got 20/20 vision!<br>
But, like, I was really surprised when you said you wanted to become a VTuber, San Diego.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vestal：</span><br>
Me too! All of a sudden you wanted to be a... "TBoober," was it?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">San Diego：</span><br>
Because it looks so hella fun! I can't wait!!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vestal：</span><br>
That's all well and good, but please make sure you take your missions seriously too, okay?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">San Diego：</span><br>
I knowwww! Jeez, Vestal, you're such a worry-wart.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kizuna AI：</span><br>
Sounds like someone's aiming to be the base's number one VTuber?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">San Diego：</span><br>
Yeeaaahhh! If I blow up then I'll get the Commander to put up a stage for me to use in the dorm! That's my goal!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vestal：</span><br>
A stage? That's going to need a lot of preparation. But rest assured, I'll handle it when the time comes.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">San Diego：</span><br>
Score! Vestal, you're the best!<br>
And you too, Boss Lady Kizuna AI. Thanks for everything.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kizuna AI：</span><br>
Boss Lady?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">San Diego：</span><br>
Yeah! You're my VTubing mentor, so you're the Boss Lady!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vestal：</span><br>
"Boss Lady Kizuna AI," you don't think that sounds a little odd?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kizuna AI：</span><br>
I mean... they did sometimes call me "Boss Lady" and whatever, back where I'm from...<br>
So, I guess if that's what San Diego wants to call me then I'm good with it! IT'S UP TO YOU!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">San Diego：</span><br>
Thankies! Alrighty! I'm rollin' up my sleeves!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kizuna AI：</span><br>
Time to San DieGO to work!!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">San Diego：</span><br>
Heeeyyy!!!<br>
That's my line!<br>

Chapter 4 - Sometimes You Wanna Go Where Every AI Knows Your Name!<br>
Port - AI's Place (Canteen)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kizuna AI：</span><br>
I think it's time we get a feel for the troubles that plague the people of this world. So, after a long hiatus, I'm reopening my bar!<br>
<br>
*woosh woosh squeak squeak*<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Benson：</span><br>
Ahoy-hoy! It's everyone's favorite, the unstoppable, the gorgeous, the adorable BENSON!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mama AI：</span><br>
C'mon in. And if it ain't Laffey too. Thanks for comin'.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
I heard you were hearing out girls' problems so I brought my sister Benson along.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mama AI：</span><br>
Oh? What sort of problems? Lay 'em on me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Benson：</span><br>
Ahahaha! Wha? Me? Benson? Problems? Th- that's ridiculous. *trembling*<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
Just come out with it already. *bonk*<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mama AI：</span><br>
(Ah, I'm playing this character, and this is the part where I jump in to help.)<br>
I know a girl a lot like Benson here. You wanna talk about it? No pressure. In fact, feel free to call me Mama AI.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
A girl like Benson?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mama AI：</span><br>
Sure. This girl, she's a real genius, but people still call her garbage just because she's always screwin' things up in a big way.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Benson：</span><br>
Oooh... I act- I actually thought of something to talk about...<br>
See, I'm always trying to get closer to the Commander, but it feels like I'm just spinning my wheels here...<br>
I thought about it for a while and I'm starting to think maybe my whole style is a little bit.... "cringey?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mama AI：</span><br>
Hmm, it is pretty tough to step outside yourself and see what others see.<br>
There's no way to know if you're lettin' out the same you that you wanna be, or that you wanna show off.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
Communicating is........ hard..........<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mama AI：</span><br>
But if Benson is really all about this Commander, don't you think your feelings are gonna come across in the end?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Benson：</span><br>
Then what the hell am I supposed to do about them...!?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mama AI：</span><br>
I'm thinkin' your Commander's gonna be plenty happy about your feelings, so why not carry on as "the unstoppable, the gorgeous, the adorable" BENSON?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Benson：</span><br>
What do you mean "carry on!?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mama AI：</span><br>
Haven't you heard? "CUTE IS JUSTICE!" Kawaii is the universal language, Benson, so keep bein' cuter and cuter and you'll impress the Commander. Right?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Benson：</span><br>
Cute is Justice....!<br>
...........<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
Benson........?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Benson：</span><br>
Right! ☆ Benson's got it down! Mama AI, Laffey, thanks a lot! ☆<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mama AI：</span><br>
Heh heh. Don't sweat it. I'm just glad we got it all cleared up. Knock 'em dead, Benson!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
Kizuna....... Mama AI..... Thanks.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Benson：</span><br>
Right then. I'd better hurry on back and study up on my cuteness! ♡ See you both again soon!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mama AI：</span><br>
Good lu- oh! Watch the threshold there, it's a little-<br>
<br>
*PLONK*<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Benson：</span><br>
Aiieee!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
Benson...........<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Benson：</span><br>
I'm fine! Ain't nothin' gonna slow down the cute Benson!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mama AI：</span><br>
Look at her toughenin' up like that... our little talk worked wonders.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kizuna AI：</span><br>
Several days later, Benson was reprimanded by the Commander for being increasingly annoying.<br>
Eh. These things happen. What are you gonna do?<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kizuna AI：</span><br>
Heyyy!<br>
<br>
*KA-BLAM!*<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Impressive. You've improved a lot since you first came to Port.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kizuna AI：</span><br>
It's all because everyone's taught me so much. Thanks, everybody!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Takao：</span><br>
I believe Lady AI could even participate as a heavy cruiser.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shoukaku：</span><br>
It's getting a bit late. What say we head back to the Port the night?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fortune：</span><br>
Good job today, everyone.<br>
<br>
Port - Sakura Dorm<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kizuna AI：</span><br>
Ughhh... I'm sooo tired. And tomorrow we've got exercises, missions, and I have a video to upload... there's too much to do!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ayanami：</span><br>
Good hustle on your exercises today.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ikazuchi：</span><br>
The candle that burns twice as bright burns half as long so why not take it easy!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kizuna AI：</span><br>
Good point! It's time for me to SLEEEEEP! GOOD NIGHT! <br>
*snoooorrrre....*<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Inazuma：</span><br>
Good night, Miss AI. Sweet dreams.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kizuna AI：</span><br>
Uh oh. I got lost on the way back from the training area....<br>
Ah!? Is that the Siren fleet!? And they surrounded me while I wasn't paying attention!?<br>
Th- this is no time to be scared. This is exactly what I trained for. Time to show my stuff! WAAAAAAAAGH!<br>
*pant* *pant* Somehow...... I beat them all......<br>
Wha!? Dammit! There's more behind m-<br>
<br>
*KA-BLAM!*<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinzy：</span><br>
Seems we can't leave you alone for a minute, AI. Are you all right?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chunechune：</span><br>
She's all right now that we're here.><<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kizuna AI：</span><br>
Thank you so much, loyal ships of the Kizuna AI Fleet! But how did you get here!?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Takao：</span><br>
More importantly, are you not coming to me post haste?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinzy：</span><br>
Gotten tired of waiting already, have you?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chunechune：</span><br>
Our meeting is destiny, isn't it?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shouhou：</span><br>
*Giggle* It's only natural to get a bit naughty when you're so frustrated, no?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Takao：</span><br>
Hmph. It seems our wedding meant nothing to you....<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kizuna AI：</span><br>
Wha? WHAAAAAAAAAAAAA!?<br>
<br>
------kup<br>
------ake up<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ikazuchi：</span><br>
WAKE UP!!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Inazuma：</span><br>
What were those strange names you kept calling out? There was a "Prinzy" and a "Chunechune?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ikazuchi：</span><br>
We got a letter from Akashi. She wanted to see you first thing in the morning. Probably preparing for today's sortie. I'll wait for you outside.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kizuna AI：</span><br>
Huh? Yeah... thanks for waking me up, Ikazuchi.<br>
Wait so....<br>

Chapter 6 - Judge Kizuna AI<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kizuna AI：</span><br>
Virtual You- Wait! No! Judge Kizuna AI here! While I've never touched on the law before, sometimes you just gotta wing it, right?<br>
It's up to my gloomy self to determine who's guilty and who's innocent!<br>
And so the First Azur Lane Kizuna Ai Court is now IN SESSIONNNNNN!!<br>
*BANG BANG*<br>
Our first case will be the trial of this young lady here. YORK, PLEASE!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">York：</span><br>
The other day, I had the Commander try some of my York's Special Drink I created while putting my talents to use in "Beverage Development."<br>
But just as he partook of the beverage, the Commander's very soul slipped its bonds and the officer fell into a deep sleep!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kizuna AI：</span><br>
Wow! What the heck did you put in it?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">York：</span><br>
I simply crafted it with the guidance of †Fate† Herself. Twas the indomitable power of †Love† boiled up from my breast!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kizuna AI：</span><br>
Ooh. Kinda hot, huh? Anyway I have no idea what you're talking about so I asked Ms. Vestal to join us. Please, explain to the court what incapacitated the Commander?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vestal：</span><br>
Aye-aye. After a thorough medical examination, I discovered some residual toxins.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">York：</span><br>
Th- that's absurd! My perfect †Formulation† would never employ such crude ingredients.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kizuna AI：</span><br>
Hmmm. Now we have one of York's "Special Drinks" right here. Why don't you take a swig and see if that answers some questions?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">York：</span><br>
Verily! In fact, I've never had a chance to taste it before. Allow me to prove my †Innocence† by draining this very cup!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vestal：</span><br>
York, I really don't think you should- aaand she's already drinking it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">York：</span><br>
*Gulp! Gulp! Nnnnnnggggggg!*<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kizuna AI：</span><br>
Ah- are you all right!? You're turning as blue as a berry!!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">York：</span><br>
Urkk... it's... a sort of "writhing around on the ground" kind of flavor. I.... understand how the Commander felt.... and with this, we are accomplices in draining the †Chalice of Sin†.... *collapses*<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kizuna AI：</span><br>
York!? Ms. Vestal! Can you do anything for her!?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vestal：</span><br>
Aye-aye. But we've really gone too far here. Do you think you could let me handle it next time, AI?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kizuna AI：</span><br>
....and they're gone.<br>
Oh, we were in the middle of a Kizuna AI trial!<br>
Wellllllll... I guess I should pass judgment.<br>
*BANG BANG*<br>
NOT GUILTY<br>
I thought she was guilty at first, but then she went ahead and chugged that stuff down all by herself. I gotta give props for that. I think the Commander'll forgive her too!<br>
I mean I did all this for the Commander's sake, after all.<br>
Really, all you need is love. And AI means love, got it? Just A.I... J.K.!<br>
Well, maybe someday somebody will drink something again, and then somebody will come along to make the magic happen one more time.<br>
And with that, today's session of Kizuna Ai court is officially ADJOURNED!!<br>
*BANG BANG*<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
*shudder* I just got the strangest feeling that somebody somewhere was doing something really stupid but... I'm just gonna let it go....<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kizuna AI：</span><br>
Wooww! So this is a Sakura fireworks festival. Fun times!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
Yep. I like candy apples.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
Looks scrumptious! Gimme a bite!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ayanami：</span><br>
I wanted a yukata.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ikazuchi：</span><br>
I want to wear one too!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Inazuma：</span><br>
All we can do is petition the Commander.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
Look, the Commander has been having issues with funding lately...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Ah, is this the artificial intelligence from the world beyond chatting about our Commander? I certainly hope you're having fun today.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kaga：</span><br>
Those sorties wore you out, didn't they? Enjoy yourself to your heart's content.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kizuna AI：</span><br>
Er, yeah! Thanks a lot!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
Kizuna AI, there's takoyaki. Want some?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kizuna AI：</span><br>
Oooh! TAKOYAKI!! Oh but I'm an AI and we don't eat. Hm. But maybe I can eat in the Azur Lane world? Hmmm...??<br>

There's a mask salesman here! Oh is this Miss Kaga's stand!?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
We still have a bit before the fireworks show. Take your time going around the stalls.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kizuna AI：</span><br>
Nice! I'm gonna be queen of the festival!<br>
Rescuing a goldfish is a piece of cake for a genius AI like me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
Kizuna AI... it's not "rescuing...."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Concord：</span><br>
Sweetie~ These candy apples are delish ♪ Ooh! You're scooping goldfish? I want in.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yuudachi：</span><br>
Fish is cool and all, but I wanna eat some MEAT!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Montpelier：</span><br>
Goldfish scooping.... maybe if I get enough of them, it'll make my big sister happy!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ibuki：</span><br>
The fireworks will begin soon. Everyone please make your way over there.<br>

Didn't I tell you to take it easy on that booze? Helena, help her out, would you?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
Right, St. Louis. Sorry, Miss Kizuna AI, I'll have to catch up with you later.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kizuna AI：</span><br>
Later, Helena! And Prinzy, don't get too drunk now. Someone might try to take you home... to me.<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kizuna AI：</span><br>
Gorgeous... I hope I can stay here for a long long time. It's gonna suck whenever I finally have to go back...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ayanami：</span><br>
Even if you go back to your world, AI, you will still be here with us.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
That's right! Even if I can't remember what these fireworks looked like, I'll never forget that I watched them with AI!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kizuna AI：</span><br>
Yeah! YEAH!!<br>
(The fireworks burst into bright rings of color and dissipate, but I'll never forget watching them together with my new friends. Even if one day we end up apart, a part of me will always remain!)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>

Oh I know! This is what they call a "shameless plug!"<br>
