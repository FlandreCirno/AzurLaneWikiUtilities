Midsummer Returns: The Villa Reconstruction<br>
<br>
1 Can We Fix It? Yes We Can!<br>
It wasn't that long ago when we were basking in the excitement of our upcoming vacation.<br>
That was until, without warning, a furious storm arrived and completely wrecked the villa resort – and our plans with it.<br>
Now the storm has gone, the tides have receded, and the skies are blue and calm again.<br>
One thing hasn't changed, though. Akashi's mental state is much like the villa – broken and shattered.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
My heart has been torn to shreds, just like the villa, nya...<br>
1%... One single percent is all I get, nya...<br>
This isn't a property sale, this is cutting out my heart and selling it for pennies on the dollar, nya...<br>
<br>
And that is how our villa resort plan took quite an unexpected turn.<br>
Once I'd signed the contract, all of us boarded a ship and headed for the resort island.<br>
After some travel time, we now see what remains of Akashi's premium resort that the natural disaster mercilessly ravaged.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Geesh. This is utter devastation.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ting An：</span><br>
Perhaps I should've haggled further for a slightly lower price.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Ahem. It looks much worse in person than it did from the aerial footage.<br>
Still, as long as we plan ahead and take it step by step, we'll be able to rebuild it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
It's that or nothing...<br>
According to the files, this resort is currently divided generally into six reconstruction sites.<br>
There's the pier area where we are now, the residential area, the indoor amusement area, the outdoor amusement area, the beach area, and the lighthouse area.<br>
I think we should rebuild the pier area first of all. It's completely out of service, and rebuilding it will make delivering goods easier in the future.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pamiat' Merkuria：</span><br>
And where are we supposed to sleep during the reconstruction period, exactly?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
The logistics department proposed sleeping in the cabins on the ship we came in. There's also the option of camping outdoors for nature lovers.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Ooh! I like that one!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">An Shan：</span><br>
Be back in the cabin before bedtime!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Ugh... Fine!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Anyone else have any questions?<br>
No? In that case, let's get out there and rebuild our vacation villa!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dupleix：</span><br>
Starting my vacation by having to do hard labor. Perfect. Just perfect.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Halford：</span><br>
Yes, it's deplorable, yet I still feel motivated! At last, we all get to work overtime together.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Malin：</span><br>
Huh?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Santa Fe：</span><br>
"Get to"?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Impero：</span><br>
Is that sarcasm?<br>
<br>
And so, with all of us banding together, our vacation villa reconstruction plan officially takes off.<br>

<br>
Midsummer Returns: The Villa Reconstruction<br>
<br>
2 Busy Pier, Busy Shore<br>
The water laps against the newly rebuilt embankments, and the repaired pier glimmers under the sun.<br>
While the pier's grey concrete may feel dull from a distance, up close, one can see a handful of cute little shoeprints dotting the still-drying paint.<br>
On the distant horizon, several ships carrying supplies from the port slowly approach the island.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Oh yeah, aren't Shimakaze and some others coming to welcome the ships?<br>
Let's have a look through the telescope.<br>
<br>
Through the telescope, I see several shipgirls running closely behind each other. A high-octane race begins in front of transport ships.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimakaze：</span><br>
Hippity hoppity! I love sprinting so much!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z52：</span><br>
Haha, yeah! Was I too fast back there? Can you girls keep up?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Triomphant：</span><br>
While speed is important, positioning is the deciding factor in a race!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">L'Audacieux：</span><br>
Well, then allow me to demonstrate how technique means nothing when faced with unparalleled speed!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimakaze：</span><br>
Hahaha! The times have changed, ladies! I shall set another milestone for speed in this new– Whuah?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Triomphant：</span><br>
Do be careful, Shimakaze! With all due respect, it's your turn to eat my dust!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Looks like they're having fun. Weren't they supposed to help with the cargo, though?<br>
Well, in their defense, we've finished the first stage of reconstruction.<br>
It's fine for the girls to have a bit of fun.<br>
<br>
As I think to myself, I realize I've wandered onto the bustling shore.<br>
Since the plans for the new area aren't set in stone yet, the girls have spontaneously gathered here to chat with each other.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Summer, the sea breeze, and a glass of fruit juice. This is starting to look like a real vacation.<br>
...Wait a second. Something's wrong here. Very wrong.<br>
<br>
There is a logo with green cat ears printed on the label of the drinks that practically everyone is holding.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
Commander, help yourself to some cold and refreshing pineapple and coconut water, nya!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(I knew it! She's lining her pockets again!)<br>
You're nothing if not a crafty businesswoman.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
My stall exists to satisfy the people's needs, nya! It's basically a charity, nya!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Edinburgh：</span><br>
Commander, have a seat! I've made some fresh chips for you! You deserve it for working so hard even now.<br>
Wait... Where did my chips go? What happened to them?!<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：I think we both know who – or rather, what – took them.</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：Yep, it was the seagulls.</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Edinburgh：</span><br>
Oh no... Those were the last chips! Bel entrusted them to me!<br>
<br>
I stop and rest with the girls, enjoying this laid-back atmosphere.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
You look awfully satisfied.<br>
Doesn't it get you fired up to see the pier area restored? And to think it was almost just a pile of rubble before.<br>
<br>
Memphis presents a drink to me – a bottle of pineapple and coconut water with Akashi's logo on it.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
No such thing as a free drink, I'm guessing?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Correct. This is the world's most valuable drink. It's related to our next reconstruction plan.<br>
Drink it. Then we can discuss things with peace of mind.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：(Drink it slowly.)</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：(Chug it at lightning speed!)</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Oh, so NOW you decide to take it slow. Are you doing this on purpose?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Y-you didn't have to down it in one gulp... I wasn't trying to rush you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Okay, that's enough sitting around.<br>
So, the next reconstruction plan. I propose that we tackle the residential area next.<br>
We can't let everyone live on transport ships or in tents forever, after all.<br>
It'll help get that vacation mood back if we're able to sleep in the villa, and it'll motivate people for the rest of the reconstruction.<br>
Also, the road from the pier to the villa has been cleared for traffic now.<br>
Come. Let's go examine where we'll be staying.<br>

<br>
Midsummer Returns: The Villa Reconstruction<br>
<br>
3 Home Sweet Home (Away From Home)<br>
After much hard work on everyone's part to secure a place to stay, I can finally get a good night's sleep in a real bedroom.<br>
What's more, I even get to enjoy a hot shower after waking up.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Ah, a bathtub and hot water. Finally feels like I'm back to civilization.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Ahem. Commander, you're on the line.<br>
By the way, I agree that bathtubs are among the best inventions in human history.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：My bathtub got the phone! Literally!</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：Oops. Wrong button.</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Sorry, we can talk about that later.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Now, I've compiled a detailed plan for the next area's reconstruction. It can move ahead once you've had a look at it.<br>
I presume you haven't had breakfast yet, correct?<br>
In that case, shall I tell you at the restaurant instead?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Sounds good. I'll be right there.<br>
<br>
The scent of food beckons me to the restaurant.<br>
Warm sunlight pierces the massive windows, casting a honey color on the oak tables.<br>
A breeze from the sea slips past the beige curtains, carrying the appetizing aroma of food even further.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious：</span><br>
Breakfast has become so much more varied ever since the kitchen was rebuilt.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">San Jacinto：</span><br>
No more having to eat rations for breakfast!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Everyone seems to be in good spirits. Looks like they've adapted to the irregularities of this unusual vacation.)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Commander, over here!<br>
Breakfast is ready. Help yourself.<br>
I have a status overview of the reconstruction project to report, so just listen while you eat.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Will do. Go ahead.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
As of now, the reconstruction of the residential area of the villa has been completed.<br>
Next, we're going to start on the indoor amusement area, which sustained comparatively little damage.<br>
Since Akashi has been singing the praises of its amusement facilities, everyone's pretty excited about it.<br>
Oh, but first! While the reconstruction remains our focus, by all means, do enjoy the comforts of the residential area before you get back into work mode.<br>
The point of this vacation is to rebuild AND have fun, after all!<br>
<br>
I ate every bit of my delicious breakfast. It made me admire what a talented chef Lung Wu is.<br>
My eyes wander, and I catch sight of Chi An, standing by the kitchen door with a look of yearning on her face.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chi An：</span><br>
*sigh*... What a bummer. Why is it that every time I come to register, the clerks all develop a stomachache?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
What's the matter, Chi An?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chi An：</span><br>
Ah, Commander!<br>
Well, you see, I heard a cooking competition is being hosted, and I was hoping I could watch the pros work. Unfortunately...<br>
<br>
There's a sign on the kitchen door that reads, "Chi An, I'm watching you..."<br>
The handwriting is obviously Lung Wu's.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Guess they think you want to do more than just watch.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chi An：</span><br>
Oh dear. Then I'll just have to find another way in.<br>
By the way, did you hear, Commander? They're having an interesting exhibit over in the living room.<br>
My, it's incredible how creative kids can be. Probably.<br>
Heehee. I should be going now.<br>
When god closes a door, he opens a window. I will find another way to enter the kitchen as long as I try hard enough...<br>
<br>
Chi An walks away, muttering a motivational speech to herself.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I have a bad feeling about this. Then again, I'm sure the organizers have ways to stop her.<br>
Anyway, I've got places to be.<br>
Better go see what damage the indoor amusement area sustained in the storm.<br>

Midsummer Returns: The Villa Reconstruction<br>
<br>
4 It's Right to Have Fun<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Téméraire：</span><br>
Ooh, this is so refreshing!<br>
Opie, come play with the fountain!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">L'Opiniâtre：</span><br>
Be careful, Tem. I'm quite the expert at water magic, see... Haha, just kidding.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pamiat' Merkuria：</span><br>
I was told this is a chocolate fountain! *lick*... Lame! It's just regular old water!<br>
I was hoping for an all-you-can-eat chocolate buffet with the Commander. I even got cookies ready and everything.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gangut：</span><br>
Hahahaha! Good idea! I might just try that on the Commander next time!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Duke of York：</span><br>
I daresay t'would be quite amusing to replace this fountain's water with red wine.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Hey, this is a shared fountain! Nobody gets to mess with or modify it!<br>
<br>
Memphis and I happen to pass by the fountain and overhear some chatter. She runs over to the group and nips their over-the-top plans in the bud.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Getting dragged into their wacky fountain ideas sounds like a pain. I better go check out the restored indoor area before they notice me.)<br>
<br>
Following the sound of a familiar voice, I enter the board game room.<br>
I'm met with a surprising sight – Fu Shun, standing in front of a game table, looking to be deep in thought.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Hmm. Should probably rework the rules. Need to figure out a good starting point...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Never seen you sitting still before. Are you feeling ill or something?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Huh?! When did you get here, Commander?<br>
Nah, I'm feeling perfectly fine! I'm just working on something totally out of this world by myself!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
How "out of this world" are we talking?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Probably, like... so out of this world, it'll turn your life upside down!<br>
Wait! Life... Turn upside down... Oh, I've got it!<br>
Thanks for the inspo, Commander! I know what to do now!<br>
<br>
Her face beams as she starts running her pen across the paper again.<br>
Just in the corner of my eye, I see the title she has written out – Lifetime Aeroplane Chess.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(She's taking this really seriously. I don't wanna disturb her, so I should go somewhere else.)<br>
<br>
After a look around, I'm back at the villa's main entrance. There, I run into Javelin and Attilio Regolo, both carrying picnic baskets.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
Mushrooms, mushrooms, come on out! I need you for my soup!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Attilio Regolo：</span><br>
Commander! Me and Javelin are about to head into the forest beyond the castle to go on an adventure!<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：The forest beyond the castle?</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：What kind of adventure?</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
We're going to the barbecue area just outside the villa! We'll be setting up camp there.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
You're still going to camp outdoors, even though we've rebuilt the residential area?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
Before it was because we had no other option, now it's part of the vacation. Completely different things!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Is anyone else coming with you?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Attilio Regolo：</span><br>
Yup! It's the domain of the brave adventurer lady. She'll bring us back safely, so don't worry!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
She means that we have Franklin guiding us, so we'll be fine.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Ah, I see. How come your guide isn't here, then?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Attilio Regolo：</span><br>
Because she's making super-duper important preparations! Probably to deal with some poaching baddies!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
She's packing up our camping gear, and we'll meet her later at the barbecue area.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Thanks for translating, Javelin.</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：Attilio, be sure to listen to every word from the brave lady.</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Heehee! Glad I could help!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Attilio Regolo：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Will do! I'll have adventure stories for you next time we meet!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
See you later, Commander!<br>
<br>
Around when Javelin and Attilio set off, Memphis also successfully saved the fountain, which had only just been repaired.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Phew. I finally managed to stop their crazy remodeling plans.<br>
I'm back, Commander. Let me continue where we left off.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I checked out the rebuilt indoor area. Everything looks pretty good.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Of course. So, let's talk about our next plan.<br>
I propose doing the outdoor amusement area next.<br>
Since the outdoor facilities aren't sheltered by buildings, they took a much harder hit from hurricanes, tsunamis, eruptions, and earthquakes...<br>
That being said, it's nothing we can't deal with. Come with me and we'll check on what the damage is like.<br>

<br>
Midsummer Returns: The Villa Reconstruction<br>
<br>
5 Swimsuit Parade on the Horizon<br>
Villa - Commander's Office<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
...And that's everything for the garden, the thermae, and the artificial lake.<br>
We've completed the reconstruction of the outdoor amusement area!<br>
<br>
I look through my office window and see the sparkling new sights.<br>
Paths are laid out in an orderly fashion, and all the amusement facilities are well-maintained.<br>
The whole scene comes alive as the girls nimbly run and leap on the freshly-laid rubber track by the roadside.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Who's that? Baltimore and Bremerton?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Think so. Judging by their outfits, they must be heading for the newly-finished tennis court.<br>
Clemenceau is planning a tennis competition. She said she'll invite you to spectate when it's all set.<br>
Anyway, that's about everything you should know.<br>
The next area we'll work on is the thing we've all been looking forward to – that's right, the beach!<br>
I've heard people are changing into their most beautiful swimsuits already out of excitement, because the sea and the sand are calling them.<br>
...Huh? Oh, wait, no...<br>
Work on the beach hasn't even started yet. We can't go around working in swimsuits, can we?<br>
Excuse me, Commander, I need to go do something about that... And don't forget to check the results of the outdoor amusement area's reconstruction, okay?<br>
<br>
Something must have just hit her – Memphis leaves the office in a hurry.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Alright. I should get out, too.<br>
<br>
As I leave the villa, a gentle breeze blows by, and the fragrance it carries fills my nostrils – the light aroma of tulips, with a mild aftertaste like morning dew.<br>
Alongside the footpath, what was once a collection of ruined trees outside the building has been reborn as a healthy, vibrant garden.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Evertsen：</span><br>
Whew. That's most of it cleaned up now.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">De Zeven Provinciën：</span><br>
Evertsen, I've made some floral tea. Shall we take a break?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Evertsen：</span><br>
Thank you, it's very delicious. Oh, Commander. What brings you here?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Heard you've been looking after the flowers in the garden and I was wondering if I could help you somehow.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Evertsen：</span><br>
Well, rest assured, my data shows that there is nothing to worry about.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">De Zeven Provinciën：</span><br>
The flowers appreciate your kindness just as much as I. Come on, little ones, say hello to the Commander.<br>
While the storm tore through them pretty badly, they'll be back to full health with proper care.<br>
It's the season when life flourishes the best, so you can look forward to them blooming before long.<br>
<br>
After saying goodbye to Evertsen and Zeven, I follow the pebble path and end up near the gazebo.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
A poetry salon? Can't say I'm interested.<br>
Leave the poem-making to the poets. I'm content with just sitting on my throne and listening to the finest poems, read aloud by my servant!<br>
Well, that being said...<br>
What did the invitation say? Bel, read it out for me again!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Belfast：</span><br>
As you wish, Your Majesty.<br>
"I have heard great stories about the Royal Navy's tea parties, with your tea and sweet treats being famed for their superb quality and highly refined flavour..."<br>
"...Therefore, I would like to request your kind collaboration in providing refreshments for the poetry salon that we will be hosting at the gazebo."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Heh. When they beg and plead like that, even I can't bring myself to say no.<br>
Bel, I entrust you and Edinburgh with the tea and biscuits. Ensure that neither Hai Tien nor any of her guests forget our class and taste!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Belfast：</span><br>
It shall be done. For the glory of the Royal Navy.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(A poetry salon at the gazebo, huh? And Hai Tien is hosting it, no less.)<br>
<br>
As I think about where to head next, a hand gently grabs my shoulder from behind.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">New Jersey：</span><br>
I've caught you now, honey!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
The beach reconstruction is underway, Commander, and it's calling for you.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Dang it...</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：Work! I love work!</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''You're not getting out of this one by running away.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">New Jersey：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Great! Let's go then, honey!<br>
<br>
And so, amid noise and chatter, reconstruction on the beach area began.<br>

<br>
6 A Sparkling Golden Beach<br>
The beach on the resort island was utterly ruined, torn to shreds when the storm passed over it.<br>
Now, though, the wind is gentle and brushes against the white sands and azure waves, signaling the beach area's full restoration.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">New Jersey：</span><br>
Haha, wow! This is the spitting image of a golden beach!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Magdeburg：</span><br>
Swimsuits and waves! Now this is what a vacay looks like!<br>

This exciting achievement calls for a grand concert.<br>
All who wish to participate, please report to me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Brennus：</span><br>
My music shall be outdone by none.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Maryland：</span><br>
We fighting with beats now? Hahah! You're getting me fired up!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Taihou：</span><br>
Heehee. This may be an opportunity to steal my Commander's eyes... An opportunity I must seize before anyone else.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Things are heating up here... I should lay low and find somewhere else to go.)<br>
<br>
For some reason, I've come to the docks. There is also some kind of event being held here.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Noshiro：</span><br>
A fishing competition? Hmm. Yes, I think this vacation would feel a little lacking without one.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Izumo：</span><br>
How curious... Holding this fishing rod puts me in the mood to perform an iai slash.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Huan Ch'ang：</span><br>
Fishing as an activity is often underestimated. Those who plan ahead, however, are more likely to be rewarded with good luck.<br>
What are your thoughts, Commander?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：I'm confident you'll catch a ton of fish.</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：Here's hoping that you don't finish emptyhanded.</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Huan Ch'ang：</span><br>
Heh. What you say is true. Tempering your character through fishing is how you learn to adapt to changing situations.<br>
Whether you reel in a big catch or come up empty, it's all determined in one blink of destiny.<br>
<br>
Despite her talk of destiny, her dignity as a supposed "professional" won't allow her to get sloppy.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Can't wait to see you in action, my fishing buddy.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Huan Ch'ang：</span><br>
I will do everything in my power, then wait for destiny's hand.<br>
<br>
As I'm about to say goodbye to Huan Ch'ang amidst her ever-increasing enthusiasm, Memphis comes to speak to me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Commander, work on the beach area is more or less done.<br>
Up next, the finale of our reconstruction project – the lighthouse area.<br>
Based on the footage the recon planes sent, the lights atop the lighthouse have suffered extensive damage and can no longer perform their duty of guiding ships.<br>
We'll have to go through the forest behind the villa to reach the lighthouse and complete the work.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Franklin：</span><br>
Perfect. All the outdoor equipment we set up the other day is gonna come in handy!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Again, this is the last part of the reconstruction project. Once the lighthouse area is finished, we can all fully enjoy this vacation!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Let's set off right now, then. To the lighthouse area!<br>
<br>
And so, reconstruction work on the lighthouse area officially began.<br>

Midsummer Returns: The Villa Reconstruction<br>
<br>
7 Let the Miracle Shine<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
*sniff sniff*... Still smells a bit humid in here.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fei Yuen：</span><br>
*huff*... Mystery is silently waiting for us in the airborne dust.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bristol：</span><br>
Great Scott...<br>
Scattered whispers seep out from the deepest dark and, like strands of cold spider silk, tightly link my mind to a forgotten tragic past...<br>
Though I've yet to lay eyes on this shapeless terror, its ominous secrets already have my heart in a tight, unrelenting grip...<br>
This marks the beginning of...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
The adventure of the murder at the snow-covered lighthouse!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fei Yuen：</span><br>
The adventure of the cursed light and the invisible ghost!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bristol：</span><br>
The adventure of the nameless disappearance in the cellar... Hey, how come your names sound cooler than mine?!<br>
...My lamp just glimmered. Was it reacting to something over there? Is that a sign that a secret route just unlocked?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ikazuchi：</span><br>
I see! You're kinda spoiling the B-story, though!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Inazuma：</span><br>
————————BACK TO THE MAIN PLOT————————<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
As usual, nothing they say ever makes sense...<br>
Well, that's that. The lighthouse area has been rebuilt. Outstanding work, Commander.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Richelieu：</span><br>
It's now time for the completion ceremony we prepared for you, Commander.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Queen Elizabeth：</span><br>
Come, servant! By my side! You organised this great undertaking, and that qualifies you to receive this honour!<br>
<br>
The morning glow dyes the sea a warm orange color, casting a shimmer like flowing champagne over the newly rebuilt lighthouse.<br>
The girls lead me to the activation switch for the lighthouse, which has a colorful ribbon tied to its front.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Clemenceau：</span><br>
Now, you just need to cut the ribbon and activate the lighthouse.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
Here, scissors. I prepared them specifically for you.<br>
<br>
Nagato produces a pair of scissors with unique ornamental mizuhiki knots tied to the handles.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagato：</span><br>
Accept our congratulations and blessings.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Thank you.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：(Cut the ribbon.)</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：(Maybe deliver a speech first?)</span>'''''<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Belfast hands me the scissors on Nagato's behalf, and I cut the ribbon.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''A quick and clean cut.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vittorio Veneto：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''I was expecting there to be a speech first.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Enterprise：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Getting straight to the point suits the Commander just as well.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''With so many expectant eyes upon me, I start expressing my sincere feelings without any polish or planning.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''I'm proud of what you've all achieved over the past few days.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''I honestly had no idea things would turn out like this when I started planning the vacation.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Still, having you by my side makes everything more fun.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''And that's all I wanted to say.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Not wanting to drag things out, I cut the ribbon.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Now our vacation can really begin!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Well, then...<br>
Once again, the reconstruction of the lighthouse – no, I should say the whole island resort – is now complete!<br>
Get out there and enjoy your villa vacation, everyone!<br>

<br>
Midsummer Returns: The Villa Reconstruction<br>
<br>
8 All Is Done and It's Time to Party!<br>
In the underground game room, neon lights flicker and illuminate the figures of the guests.<br>
Among the crowds, Hatsuzuki, wearing her beloved dress, gently shakes her glass with a strange, mischievous grin.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:189}：</span><br>
Heehee. Your attention, please!<br>
There's only one rule to the game party tonight – have as much fun as you can!<br>
You, too, Commander! Have a good time!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Taihou：</span><br>
You don't want to leave because I'm by your side, isn't that right, my Commander?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Formidable：</span><br>
Wrong. You're having fun because you're here with me, correct, Commander?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Taihou：</span><br>
Heehee... So you're issuing a declaration of war, I see.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Formidable：</span><br>
Hm? Say, Commander, why don't we forget about all the humdrum interpersonal relationships and have some strawberry cake? Here!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Taihou：</span><br>
Why, you... Heehee. It goes without saying that my cherry cake is better. Please open your mouth, my Commander!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(......)<br>
(What to do? Should I just run for it?)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Formidable：</span><br>
Commander? Hellooo? Why are you just standing there?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Taihou：</span><br>
I'm waiting for you to have a taste, my Commander!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(......)<br>
(I appreciate what they're trying to do, but there's only one of me.)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hatsuzuki：</span><br>
Sorry for butting in, but I've got drinks for you!<br>
<br>
Hatsuzuki comes along, pushing a cart. She is my salvation in this moment of desperation.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hatsuzuki：</span><br>
Heehee. Why are you making that face?<br>
Don't worry, I'm rooting for you in my heart!<br>
I'm not going to save you, though. I know how to pick my fights!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Janus：</span><br>
Um, excuse me, Hatsuzuki... Could you bring us some juice?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hatsuzuki：</span><br>
Sure thing!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Janus：</span><br>
So... I can't take both feet off the ground at the same time?<br>
Ugh, this is so hard... Need to stay balanced, or I'll fall over!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jervis：</span><br>
I'll keep you stable. Just breathe and take the shot.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Janus：</span><br>
There! ...I-I did it! It went in.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jervis：</span><br>
Ahem... Yes, it sure did.<br>
The cue ball, that is.<br>
I'm afraid that's a foul, Janus.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Janus：</span><br>
A... A foul?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hatsuzuki：</span><br>
Hey! I've got the juice you asked for.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gallant：</span><br>
Hatsuzuki! We need you for a sec!<br>
<br>
Gallant and some friends are enthusiastically playing a board game. They raise their hands toward Hatsuzuki.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hatsuzuki：</span><br>
I'll be right there!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Victorious：</span><br>
You certainly look busy. Perhaps you need the help of a gorgeous lady like me, hmm?<br>
I'm willing to lend a hand, but first, you must praise the beauty of the Royal Navy!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sirius：</span><br>
Miss Victorious, here is the wine that you ordered.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Victorious：</span><br>
Actually, I withdraw my offer. Helping people just doesn't work to accentuate my beauty.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gallant：</span><br>
What?! Nooo! Why'd I have to draw the go-to-jail card?!<br>
Me, of all people! The captain of the Guards! The protector of justice and order! The designer of our barriers and gates!<br>
And now I'm being thrown into jail?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pompeo Magno：</span><br>
Have no fear! Captain Pompey will save you!<br>
With this card, I'll... Hm? "Swap"? My character swaps statuses with the player ahead of me?<br>
Well... It's just a game! A trifling matter like this could never perturb the almighty Captain Pompey!<br>
Urgh... My stomach hurts all of a sudden... Can I leave my seat for five minu– Actually, until the end of the round?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Oh, a property purchase card! It's for the... Wait, it's for the haunted hotel?! Oh hell yeah!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pompeo Magno：</span><br>
So, owning this property means you can actually make everyone who passes by cough up a hefty sightseeing fee?!<br>
Phew! Good thing I landed in prison. Hahaha!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gallant：</span><br>
NOOOOOO!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fei Yuen：</span><br>
Did you say... "haunted"?<br>
<br>
The very next moment, Fei Yuen's piece rushes toward the haunted hotel without a hint of hesitation.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fei Yuen：</span><br>
Heheh! Lady Yuen's time has come!<br>
Onward at full speed! This is our vacation adventure!<br>
<br>
Just as her piece lands on the haunted hotel, Janus finally sinks a red ball into the pocket.<br>
After an intense feeding battle, Taihou and Formidable, in a synchronized move, launch their next offensive...<br>
Amidst cheers and laughter, all my fatigue melts into pleasant memories. Our hard work has paid off.<br>
This never-ending villa vacation has only just begun.<br>
Midsummer Returns: The Villa Reconstruction - The End<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=The Villa Cooking Competition|选项=9|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Impero：</span><br>
Mmh! Sho good! I want seconds!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mutsuki：</span><br>
Hrmh... Does this have black pepper in it? I want something sweeter...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sheffield：</span><br>
Lacking in presentation, but the flavour gets a pass. I cannot argue it isn't authentic, since this stew is your local dish, after all, Liverpool.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Liverpool：</span><br>
Heheh. I don't usually make it since I've had it so much that I've grown right bored of it. I gave it my all for this cooking competition, though!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sheffield：</span><br>
Despite being one of the judges, quite frankly, I still do not see the point in this competition.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Liverpool：</span><br>
Some Empery girls suggested it. Heard whoever wins gets the honour of being the villa's head chef, and that's why I signed up!<br>
<br>
BOOM! BANG!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Liverpool：</span><br>
Whuah?! What was that?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sheffield：</span><br>
It came from the kitchen. We should take a look.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cheshire：</span><br>
*cough cough*... All the seasonings...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi：</span><br>
*cough cough*... It seems an aprone alone isn't enough. I'll need to wear sleeve covers as well.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Liverpool：</span><br>
What're you doing in here?! Trying to blow up the kitchen?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sheffield：</span><br>
There's chilli sauce covering everything up to the shelves... Are you making some nouveau chilli sauce-based graffiti art?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cheshire：</span><br>
No! We're seriously cooking here! We just made a small mistake.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mutsuki：</span><br>
Amagi, are you okay?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi：</span><br>
*cough cough*... Stand back, Mutsuki. You wouldn't want to get hit with flying hot oil.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Liverpool：</span><br>
Miss Amagi, you just can't just drop a still-wet fish into hot oil. It'll go everywhere as soon as it hits the pan!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sheffield：</span><br>
Well, I can safely say I know what score they'll get for this.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Liverpool：</span><br>
Hey, they still have a chance! It's rude to both the chef and the food to grade it before it's even been plated!<br>
Wait, what happened to the pressure cooker?! It's pitch black! Who did this?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sheffield：</span><br>
It's been carbonised through and through. I'm afraid it's destined for the rubbish heap.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi：</span><br>
But my stew isn't done... I-is there a spare pressure cooker?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Liverpool：</span><br>
Sadly, no. Maybe try with another dish? Like sushi, maybe.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi：</span><br>
I do have rice for sushi, but no fish. I'd never dare to use half-fried fish as a topping.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cheshire：</span><br>
I've got loads of sardines left, at least! You can use 'em for your sushi if you want!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi：</span><br>
Sardines? Those might just work.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sheffield：</span><br>
What dish will you make, Cheshire? I cannot for the life of me determine what it is you're cooking.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cheshire：</span><br>
Heheh, come on, it's obvious. I'm making my speciality – the famous dish in all of the Royal Isla–<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sheffield：</span><br>
*sigh*... You're making fish and chips. I see. I truly shouldn't have gotten my hopes up.<br>
<br>
A while later, the food was done. The girls decided to start with the sardine sushi.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Impero：</span><br>
Yeah, it works. Would probably taste better if they weren't so cold.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mutsuki：</span><br>
Om, nom... It tastes like home! Nom, nom!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sheffield：</span><br>
This sushi has been delicately made and its presentation is excellent. The flavour, on the other hand... It's simply alright.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Amagi：</span><br>
Heehee. I'm just glad that you like it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Liverpool：</span><br>
Alright, then it's Cheshire's fish and chips next.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sheffield：</span><br>
I don't have high hopes for this, but... Hrmh?! This flavour isn't what I expected!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Mutsuki：</span><br>
Sweet fishies!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cheshire：</span><br>
(Huh?! Sweet?! No way! Don't tell me I mixed up the sugar and salt!)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Impero：</span><br>
And these fries – so spicy!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cheshire：</span><br>
(Spicy?! Did I use chilli sauce in place of tomatoes?)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Impero：</span><br>
Hmm. I'm surprised by how filling this is. I thought it was a snack food.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sheffield：</span><br>
The sweet fish and spicy chips come together well, like they were dipped in a sweet and spicy sauce. This is a surprisingly good combination.<br>
I admit I was too quick to judge. You're a more capable cook than I gave you credit for, Cheshire.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cheshire：</span><br>
I-I am? Really?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Impero：</span><br>
Really. Now let's announce the results. The winner of this cooking competition is–<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chi An：</span><br>
Hello!<br>
<br>
The one who must not be allowed to cook suddenly appears before the girls.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chi An：</span><br>
Whew, finally. You're having a cooking competition, right? I'd like to participate!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Liverpool：</span><br>
M-miss Chi An?! Uh, well, sorry to say, but the competition just wrapped up.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chi An：</span><br>
Aww. That's fine, though! Even if I can't be the head chef, I'm happy with just getting to share my cooking with all of you! I'll start right–<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sheffield：</span><br>
No! Don't let her into the kitchen!<br>
<br>
The panel and the participants all rushed toward Chi An at once. They feared that an unexpected disaster would come out of the kitchen sooner than an unexpected hit.<br>

{{折叠面板|标题=Recyclers, Assemble!|选项=10|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ping Hai & Ning Hai & U-96：</span><br>
Recyclers, assemble!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
...Come again?<br>
Did you call me over just to demonstrate your catchphrase and pose?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-96：</span><br>
Nah, not just that. We're thinkin' we could use someone level-headed and hardworking like you to lead our team to success.<br>
So, won't ya be our ambassador? Also, any feedback on our pose and catchphrase would be 'preciated.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
*sigh*... This is completely out of left field for me. I don't think you even need a pose and a catchphrase to begin with.<br>
You said you were going to exhibit the old things you repurposed, right? Or are you just going to stand in front of the display shelf this whole time?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-96：</span><br>
What, is that not allowed?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
If that's what you want to do, I won't stop you...<br>
All I'm saying is, if I'm going to be your ambassador, at least let me see what you've made.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ping Hai：</span><br>
No problem!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ning Hai：</span><br>
Ping, bring out the one!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
What... is this supposed to be?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ping Hai：</span><br>
It's based on an idea my sis had. It's a fully automatic baozi maker shaped like a giant panda!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
A giant panda baozi maker? How in the world did you make this?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ning Hai：</span><br>
The baozi maker parts were made from recycled stuff from the kitchen and the living room.<br>
See how it looks like it's holding bamboo in its left hand and a bowl in its right?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ping Hai：</span><br>
Well, that bamboo tube is actually used to hold the filling, and the bowl holds the bun wrappers!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ning Hai：</span><br>
Then when it eats the filling and the bun wrapper...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ping Hai：</span><br>
It starts forming baozi inside its tummy!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ning Hai：</span><br>
Then those go into a bamboo steamer and bam, you have the perfect buns!<br>
<br>
Ning Hai and Ping Hai start the machine, after which a ding rings out from the giant panda's stomach.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ning Hai：</span><br>
There. One serving of piping hot baozi!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ping Hai：</span><br>
So yummy. We have to be the best recyclers ever.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
While the idea is a bit eccentric, the end result looks very solid.<br>
Let me just... Nom. Nothing beats a baozi fresh out of the steamer. Om, nom...<br>
...Ahem. U-96, what have you made?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-96：</span><br>
Get ready for this. My piece is a mechanical frickin' dragon. Made it out of parts I collected from old furniture.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
It's pretty big, that's for sure.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-96：</span><br>
Heh, and it does more than just look, ya know. Got Regensburg to outfit it with all kinds of baller visual effects.<br>
Pretty sick, huh? Put this bad boy by your door and nobody's ever gonna dare break in. This next thing's really gonna blow your mind, though.<br>
Check out his forearms.<br>
Yeah, these li'l babies are for shakin' drinks!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
Uh...<br>
Did you say "shaking drinks"?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-96：</span><br>
Sure did. Smoothies, cocktails, whipped coffee – you name it, it'll have it mixed in no time.<br>
Whaddya think? Gotta be an ace among aces when it comes to recycling, right?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
(My first impression of it and what it's actually used for could not be any more different.)<br>
Um... It should be fine as an exhibition piece. Let's put it in the living room. Now to make some posters for publicity...<br>
<br>
Sometime later...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z35：</span><br>
Wow! So Z23 and the other girls made all of these out of recycled materials?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z36：</span><br>
A panda cooking machine, and a... No! Z35, stay back! I sense an evil, heinous presence hiding within the dragon's bod–<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z35：</span><br>
Ooh, it can make smoothies!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z36：</span><br>
My bewitching eyes shall cleanse this filth! Oh, make a smoothie for me, too!<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Maggiore Baracca：</span><br>
Ugh. Life is so dull. I just wanna throw it all away...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hai Yung：</span><br>
So this is how my life ends. Disappointingly and too soon...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Painlevé：</span><br>
O, Holy Iris, please...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">An Shan：</span><br>
FUUU SHUUUN!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Whoa, easy! It was you who drew the card, so don't pin this on me! Whuah?! Somebody heeelp!<br>
<br>
It all started 30 minutes ago...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Malin：</span><br>
What is this? Aeroplane chess? Why would chess come with a set of cards?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Because this is a new game I came up with – LIFETIME aeroplane chess! These cards have all kinds of attributes and events on 'em.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Maggiore Baracca：</span><br>
Let's see what my cards say...<br>
"Attribute: Idol"? "Event: Reappointed as secretary"?<br>
Hey, this might actually be interesting.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">An Shan：</span><br>
So what does that have to do with aeroplane chess?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
You know how, in regular aeroplane chess, everyone's just scrambling to get to the end?<br>
Well, lifetime aeroplane chess is the complete opposite of that! When your piece reaches the finish line, your life ends!<br>
So it becomes a game of how to reach the peak of life within a limited number of rounds. It's all about skill and luck!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hai Yung：</span><br>
Meaning, you get to experience a different life in the game. Now you have my attention.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Painlevé：</span><br>
I pray that the Holy Iris will bless me, even in this other life.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Up to six people can play at a time, so we can all play together!<br>
<br>
The game was set up, and the first round began.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Le Malin, you rolled a six, which means your life advances by six years. Now to pull a card from the minors pile... You got the child prodigy attribute!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Malin：</span><br>
Oh! Surely this means I sleep during classes and still get straight A's, right?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
That depends on your event card! Okay, Baracca also rolled a six. Let's see what attribute she gets. Iiit's... sickly constitution!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Maggiore Baracca：</span><br>
Maaan, there are negative attributes, too? Well, I guess being a frail but beautiful girl isn't so bad.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Painlevé：</span><br>
Now it's my turn. I got a five, and my card, says... "Rare attribute: Flowers in the mirror, moon on the water." What does that mean?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Whoa! You lucky son of a gun! There are only a small handful of rare cards, and the effect of this one makes you immune to events, good or bad!<br>
Alright, let's see what Hai Yung rolls!<br>
<br>
Five rounds later...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hai Yung：</span><br>
An entrepreneurship achievement... Starting out broke and slowly building up a fortune and accumulating achievements is pretty fun.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">An Shan：</span><br>
Meanwhile, I haven't achieved much of anything. I suppose that's what the path of moderation attribute does to me...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Malin：</span><br>
Event: Salary raise? That's nice and all, but I've been doing nothing but studying and working this whole time! Can't I get an event that gives me a vacation or a little luxury?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Maggiore Baracca：</span><br>
It's been over 20 years for me now, and I want something new to happen to my frail beauty already...<br>
<br>
10 rounds later...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Uh-oh, looks like Hai Yung drew the corporate bankruptcy event!<br>
Time to calculate your lifetime and see what you get... Aww, looks like your life ends here.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hai Yung：</span><br>
My business flopped and I ended up with hundreds of thousands worth of debt... Just like that, it's curtains for my whole life.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Maggiore Baracca：</span><br>
Ahaha – another lucky event. Same old, same old... When you have THIS much money, it loses all meaning and just becomes a number.<br>
No adventures, no partners, just me and a mountain of cash... That's so dull. Makes me wanna just throw it all away...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Painlevé：</span><br>
*sigh*... All my wishes have been denied. Even though my life is going smoothly, what kind of life is one where none of your wishes come true? O, Holy Iris...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Uhh, next round! Le Malin, it's– Wait, is she seriously asleep?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">An Shan：</span><br>
She must have collapsed from overwork after getting all those stacking workaholic attributes.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Oookay then, it's your turn, An Shan... Oh, just as your luck was turning around, you drew the mid-life collapse event and your life ended.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">An Shan：</span><br>
FUUU SHUUUN!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Hey, it was you who drew the card, so don't pin this on me!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">An Shan：</span><br>
I'm NOT pinning it on you! I'm just calling for you to make some tiny little improvements to your game! That's all!<br>
At a minimum, you need to retune it until everyone can have a good time! Isn't that your responsibility as the developer?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
I, uhh, just remembered I promised Fei Yuen something, so if you'll excuse– Whuah?! Stay away from me! Somebody heeelp!<br>
Aaaahhh! Stop chasing meee! Painlevé! Baracca! Hai... Yung...?<br>
<br>
Fu Shun called all their names, but none responded – they just sat there with empty eyes. None of them moved an inch until An Shan dragged Fu Shun out of the room.<br>

<br>
Outdoor Barbecue Area<br>
Having set up the portable stove and pot, Javelin is attentively stirring the bubbling food. Attilio, holding a bowl, stands by her side, with eyes twinkling in anticipation.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
The colour of the soup is getting richer. It should be ready now!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Attilio Regolo：</span><br>
Oooh! Even the bunnies are drooling!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
Let me have a taste. *huff puff*... Owch! I nearly burned my tongue!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
It's bad for your digestion if the food's too hot. You should wait until it cools down a bit.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
Ah, Commander! Are you here to camp with us?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Attilio Regolo：</span><br>
With you here, all the baddies in the forest will be too scared to come close!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Something about this feels off... I'll just hold my tongue.)<br>
What are you making?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Attilio Regolo：</span><br>
A soup with mushrooms we gathered! We picked all the fruits on these platters, too.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
A mushroom soup, eh? No wonder it smells so good.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
That's probably thanks to the spices! Speaking of which – Attilio, what spices did you bring?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Attilio Regolo：</span><br>
That's the thing – I didn't bring any!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
What? But then where'd the spices that I put in... Wait... What did I even put in?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Attilio Regolo：</span><br>
Hey, why are there two Duke Monochrome Bunnies? No wait, White Bunnies and Black Bunnies too...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Their reactions are weird. Don't tell me...)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Franklin：</span><br>
You two! What are you cooking?<br>
<br>
Franklin's sharp exclamation brings the two back to their senses.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
Whoa! Y-you scared me... What just happened?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Attilio Regolo：</span><br>
Duke Monochrome Bunny became one again...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Franklin：</span><br>
Those mushrooms don't have any distinct features, but they're definitely the kind that makes you see dancing fairies when you eat them!<br>
<br>
Franklin takes the bowl of soup from Javelin's hands, pours it back into the pot, then empties the whole thing.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Attilio Regolo：</span><br>
H-how could it be... Did I pick some bad mushrooms?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Franklin：</span><br>
Let me take a look at the uncooked ones... Actually, quite a lot of these are edible, though some are a little tricky to prepare correctly.<br>
Attilio, wanna learn how to identify different shrooms? Heck, we could pick some new ones together.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Attilio Regolo：</span><br>
Ooh, sure! When I get back, I'm gonna make the best soup ever for the Commander!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
I'll come with you too! Can you teach me how to catch fish while we're at it?<br>
<br>
While Franklin, Attilio, and Javelin went off to forage, I stayed at the campsite and set up the tent.<br>
When I was done, I happened to notice that Akashi was selling barbecue supplies nearby. Despite how expensive they were, she was confident she'd make big bucks – a statement that gave me a bad premonition.<br>
By the time I returned to the tent, they had just come back.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Attilio Regolo：</span><br>
Commander! Franklin taught me how to tell good shrooms from bad shrooms! Now I'm gonna learn how to make yummy mushroom soup!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
Heehee! Commander, look! I caught loads of fish! We should grill them!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Franklin：</span><br>
We can start making barbecue at any time! I brought along a grill, seasonings, and ingredients before we set off.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Awesome. Let the barbecue begin!<br>
<br>
We got to work under Franklin's command, and soon we had prepared an appetizing feast of barbecue and mushroom soup.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
These both taste incredibly good for a beginner's first shot at them. You should consider becoming chefs, you two!<br>
The mushrooms are nice and spongy after absorbing lots of soup, and the soup is really elevated by the flavors in the mushrooms!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Attilio Regolo：</span><br>
Heehee! I have the chops of a real chef! Of course, I couldn't have done it without my bunny assistants.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
And this fish, wow – crunchy and fragrant on the outside, soft and juicy on the inside. It's perfectly grilled!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
I can make some more for you if you like it that much!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Constellation：</span><br>
Commander? Are you having a picnic?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Javelin：</span><br>
Constellation! When did you get here?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Constellation：</span><br>
I was setting up my telescope not far from this campsite, and that's when I was drawn here by the smell of delicious food.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Franklin：</span><br>
Ahaha! The smell of barbecue travels far, huh? There're tons of ingredients left, so help yourself!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Constellation：</span><br>
Thanks! Oh, by the way, I saw Akashi on the way here. She'd set up a stall that seemed to be pretty popular.<br>
Apparently, though, her food didn't taste quite as good as it smelled.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Oh. That's why she said she'd make big bucks – she was riding our tailwind.)<br>
<br>
After having our fill of food, we went to the place where Constellation had set up her telescope. We sat on the grass and gazed at the night sky together.<br>
With Constellation as our guide, we lost ourselves in the night sky. She'd point out a star, and then another, and soon we were all caught up, eagerly counting along. We didn't even think of heading back until we'd spotted nearly every star she named.<br>

<br>
I spot Evertsen and Zeven standing by a flower bed in the garden, both of them looking pale.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Evertsen：</span><br>
Commander, we have an issue.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
What's wrong? You look like you've seen a ghost.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">De Zeven Provinciën：</span><br>
There are... vegetables growing in the flower bed. Biologically speaking, that's not possible.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Evertsen：</span><br>
This is not a biology issue. Someone must've made a mistake somewhere for this to happen.<br>
<br>
Zeven cups her ear as if listening to a voice, then opens her pouch of seeds.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">De Zeven Provinciën：</span><br>
It does appear that some vegetable seeds were mixed in with the flower seeds.<br>
But I would have noticed that while planting them.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Evertsen：</span><br>
Hmm. Commander, have you seen anyone else around the garden?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(I have an idea of who could've done something like this...)<br>
I think I know who did it. Come with me.<br>
<br>
After going around the garden, we find Albacore hidden inside a bush.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Albacore：</span><br>
Huh?! How could you possibly have figured out I was here?!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Because I'm your commander...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Evertsen：</span><br>
We would've never known you were hiding here if not for the Commander.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Albacore：</span><br>
Teehee! Sounds like my stealth skill's improved! My first place in the next hide-and-seek competition is set in stone as long as the Commander doesn't join!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Ahem. Albacore, do you know anything about the seeds growing in the flower bed?<br>
I'll be to the point – we already know someone put vegetable seeds in there. Just tell us what you know.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">De Zeven Provinciën：</span><br>
Isn't that a leading question, Commander?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Sure is. It's part of my plan.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Albacore：</span><br>
Wait, you figured it out?! Then what are... Wait, what?<br>
I did put vegetable seeds in the bag with onions inside. How'd they end up in the flower bed?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">De Zeven Provinciën：</span><br>
Onions?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Evertsen：</span><br>
Are you referring to this?<br>
<br>
Evertsen produces a tulip bulb.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Albacore：</span><br>
Yeah, that! Looks like a plump onion to me!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Evertsen：</span><br>
This is a tulip bulb. Not an onion.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Albacore：</span><br>
A tulip bulb?! Ohh. So I got 'em confused? Dang, my plan failed!<br>
Um, I'm sorry! I didn't do that on purpose, okay?<br>
I was just, uh... trying to introduce a larger variety of fresh vegetables into everyone's diets! That's all!<br>
I won't do it again. Pinky promise! Just let me off the hook!<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：(Say nothing and just stare at her.)</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：(Look at Evertsen and Zeven.)</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">De Zeven Provinciën：</span><br>
You wanted people to eat more fresh vegetables, so you got those seeds into the flower bed... That makes sense. Here I thought you were playing a prank on us.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Evertsen：</span><br>
...Very well. I'll treat this as a research opportunity to study the growth of vegetables.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Albacore：</span><br>
So you're telling me I'm the reason for that flower bed filled with veggies? Ahahaha... Wow, okay! Must be a lot of hard work growing so many of 'em!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
That reaction doesn't sound right to me...<br>
<br>
Before I can figure it out, I hear the sound of a water hose bursting not far from here.<br>
Not long after, Owari shows up, hose in hand and drenched from head to toe.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Owari：</span><br>
Guess that pump was too strong for the hose. Hey, what's happenin' here? Got a real crowd going.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">De Zeven Provinciën：</span><br>
Ah, Owari. What were you doing with that hose?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Owari：</span><br>
This? Was tryna pump some water from the lake into the field. I was gonna grow some more bussin' veggies!<br>
Y'all just messin' around, or? 'Cause if so, I'mma have a look-see at the veggies!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Albacore：</span><br>
Ahaha – we could ALL go have a look-see at the fresh vegetables, then!<br>
<br>
As she says that, Albacore starts following Owari who's heading for the flower bed with vegetables growing in it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Evertsen：</span><br>
Wait a moment, please. Are you growing vegetables in the flower bed, Owari?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Owari：</span><br>
Yeah? Who'd ya think it was?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">De Zeven Provinciën：</span><br>
Albacore...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Evertsen：</span><br>
Why did you lie and say that you planted them?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Albacore：</span><br>
Ahahaha... Y'know... I mean, it WAS me who put those veggie seeds in there!<br>
But how could Owari tell the difference between the seeds? I thought I mixed 'em up good and proper!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Owari：</span><br>
Uh, no? I brought all those seeds myself. Ya really think I would confuse 'em for somethin' else?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Albacore：</span><br>
What? So then I actually had nothing to do with this whole thing?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Evertsen：</span><br>
I wouldn't say you had no involvement.<br>
Yes, it was Owari who planted the vegetables, and your mix-up of seeds didn't have any serious repercussions. However...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
You still caused mischief, and that can't go unpunished.<br>
<br>
And so, Evertsen and Zeven imparted their knowledge to Albacore, who made a fresh start as a skilled seed separator.<br>

{{折叠面板|标题=The Doubles Tennis Match|选项=14|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<br>
I walk over to the newly built outdoor tennis court and find that there's a fierce match going on.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
O-one more time! I swear I'll hit the ball this time!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Baltimore：</span><br>
......<br>
<br>
Baltimore says nothing as she smacks the ball with all her might, scoring another point in the blink of an eye.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
What the hell was that?! It curved!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Clemenceau：</span><br>
Let me take a swing at it. Take a breather on the bench.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
No, not yet! I've seen through her serves! This next time will be it, I guaran–<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Clemenceau：</span><br>
Have you looked into her eyes? Those are the eyes of someone whose only focus is the score. You don't want the Commander to see that despair-inducing scoreboard, do you?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
C-Commander?! Since when did...?!<br>
Urgh... Be smug while you still can, you two! I WILL turn this around in the next set!<br>
<br>
With Clemenceau now on the court, Bremerton, playing alongside Baltimore, starts actively jostling for position. She and Clemenceau then exchange the ball back and forth.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Something tells me this is no ordinary doubles match.)<br>
<br>
The set ends, and all four players take a seat beside me to catch their breaths.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
This isn't a regular old doubles match, is it?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Clemenceau：</span><br>
Heehee. Indeed it isn't. How perceptive of you.<br>
There can be only one winner in this match – whoever scores the most points.<br>
You need to be vigilant of your opponent's offense as well as keep track of your partner's score. Despite there being teams, there are no allies in this game. Fascinating, wouldn't you agree?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I see. That's a new one.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bremerton：</span><br>
So yeah, even though Balty's on my team, I still have a chance to beat her!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Clemenceau：</span><br>
Well, Commander, now that you're here to spectate...<br>
Could I perhaps ask you to give a small reward to whoever wins this?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
You already started with the assumption there'd be a "small reward," didn't you?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Clemenceau：</span><br>
Heehee. I'd argue you're the most important factor in all of this, Commander.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
Alright, interval over! Time to start the next set! You shall all be witnesses to my magnificent comeback!<br>
<br>
As the second set went on, Marco Polo gradually got into a rhythm, taking advantage of the other three's waning energy to score several points.<br>
In spite of this, Baltimore maintained her score lead from the first set. The match ended with no one surpassing her in points.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Baltimore：</span><br>
Whew. Now that was a match alright.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bremerton：</span><br>
*pant*... *pant*... I'll beat ya one of these days, Balty!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Clemenceau：</span><br>
Our opponents were far more skilled than I'd anticipated... Heh, a small error in judgment can indeed lead to the collapse of all your plans.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Marco Polo：</span><br>
Baltimore's serves were impossible to get back. I did make up some ground later on, but not nearly enough to close the gap...<br>
<br>
In contrast to the frustrated gazes of the defeated, Baltimore's victorious eyes are all but glued to me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Baltimore：</span><br>
Seems I won.<br>
Reckon I could ask for that "small reward" now?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：(Nod.)</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：(Stay silent with the knowledge of what comes next.)</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Baltimore：</span><br>
Whew. This match went by so fast, I was just hitting my stride.<br>
Come play another game with me, Commander!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I knew this would happen...<br>
<br>
And so, a relentless match spanning hundreds of rallies unfolded between us.<br>
Okay, obviously not hundreds, but enough to satisfy her... I think.<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Edinburgh：</span><br>
Oh nooo! Commander, look out!<br>
<br>
While passing through a corridor, I collide with Edinburgh as she hurriedly turns a corner.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Edinburgh：</span><br>
Owch... My head is spinning...<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：(Help her get up.)</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：(Pat her head.)</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
You okay, Edinburgh?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Edinburgh：</span><br>
Ah, um! I-I'm sorry, I was in such a rush that I didn't look out ahead, and...<br>
Right, I don't have time to explain! I need to get to the villa and push the food cart immediately!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Ah, for that poetry salon down at the gazebo, right?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Edinburgh：</span><br>
Oh, you know about it? You see, Her Majesty ordered Bel and me to provide tea and biscuits for them.<br>
Bel has already done her part, and my job is just to move the cart there. Are you going to attend the salon too, Commander?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Sure, why not? Let's go.<br>
<br>
Edinburgh and I push the cart to the gazebo. All the participants are already here.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hai Tien：</span><br>
Oh? Will you be joining us today, Commander?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Not outright "joining" you, I'm just curious to hear what poems you're going to create.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hai Tien：</span><br>
Alright, then you and Edinburgh should take a seat over there, please.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Edinburgh：</span><br>
Wait, me too? I just came to deliver these refreshments.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hai Tien：</span><br>
Don't be shy. There's no guest limit or any such thing, and we're by no means as crowded as a beehive.<br>
I'm certain you, as a Royal Maid, have received formal education in poetry, and we would love to have you in attendance.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Edinburgh：</span><br>
Education in poetry? Well, that is standard for Royal Maids. I think.<br>
However, I don't know what the theme of this salon is, so...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hai Tien：</span><br>
That's the thing – we've yet to formally decide on one.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Brest：</span><br>
Blessed are we by the Champion's presence, and for this Champion, we ought to dedicate a fine epic poem...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z46：</span><br>
That champion must have an unwavering heart, courage filling it to the brim. A heart one may liken to a ballad...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Champagne：</span><br>
With the sun's warm glow and sparrows' song, roses bloom where we belong. Let us together relish the philosophy of nature...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hai Tien：</span><br>
Interesting... An epic poem, a ballad, and a philosophical lyric. I see you each have a different preferred genre.<br>
In that case, why don't I compose one half of the poem whilst another person takes the other half?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
You could draw straws to decide who.<br>
No need to fuss over the poem's format. It might even be more interesting to see how the different styles come together.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hai Tien：</span><br>
An excellent idea! That was the issue I was most concerned about, in fact.<br>
I have a few bookmarks we could use as substitutes for straws. Whoever pulls the red one will compose the poem's second half.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Brest：</span><br>
The bookmark that I drew... It is golden.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Champagne：</span><br>
Mine, the hue of the sea.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z46：</span><br>
It appears I am not fate's chosen.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hai Tien：</span><br>
That leaves... Edinburgh?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Edinburgh：</span><br>
......<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
......<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Edinburgh：</span><br>
C-Commander! I-I-I don't know what to do! I drew the red bookmark!<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：(Offer her comforting words.)</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：(Give her a sympathetic look.)</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hai Tien：</span><br>
Then Edinburgh will be the one to write the second half. Please start preparing now.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Edinburgh：</span><br>
What?! C-Commander, you proposed this, so I'd like you to take at least some responsibility!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Sometimes with poetry, emotion matters more than skill.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Edinburgh：</span><br>
Are you... comforting me? Well, I'm afraid it's not helping at all!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
If you just convince yourself that it's poetry, it will become it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Edinburgh：</span><br>
Is that really how it works?!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Remember, you are a Royal Maid. Many pioneers in various fields, including poetry, come from your birthplace.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Edinburgh：</span><br>
That's true... Okay, I'll become a poet so great this time that even Her Majesty will be proud of me!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hai Tien：</span><br>
Okay, Edinburgh, I've finished my part. Please continue from here.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z46：</span><br>
......<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Champagne：</span><br>
Is this... poetry?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Brest：</span><br>
...I applaud your uncompromising effort to complete Hai Tien's sonnet. You've done well, Edinburgh.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hai Tien：</span><br>
Royal Islands poetry is... just as brimming with character as I've heard!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Edinburgh：</span><br>
Ahaha... Th-thank you...<br>
(COMMANDEEER!)<br>
<br>
After the poetry salon, feeling ashamed, Edinburgh immersed herself in studying the essence of sonnets under Belfast's guidance.<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Huan Ch'ang：</span><br>
Why won't the fish bite?! The divination I did should've been accurate!<br>
<br>
A lively fishing competition is taking place over by the docks.<br>
Due to the growing number of participants, the competition area has been divided into several zones along the shore.<br>
Closest to me is Huan Ch'ang, fully decked out in professional fishing gear. There is a hexagram compass lying next to her.<br>
She certainly has the aura of a master angler, but the grumbling under her breath betrays her struggles.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Huan Ch'ang：</span><br>
My position and equipment are all in order, too, so why am I getting nothing?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Don't lose your cool. Maybe your luck will turn around.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Huan Ch'ang：</span><br>
Hm? C-Commander?!<br>
Well, yes, you're right. I admit that I need further practice when it comes to the art of fishing.<br>
But that obviously doesn't mean I shouldn't be able to catch a single one!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
You, uh, used divination to work out where all the fish are, right?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Huan Ch'ang：</span><br>
Yes.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
When you throw your hook at a load of fish, the ripples it creates will scare them off. Try throwing it further away from them.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Huan Ch'ang：</span><br>
You... You have a point. I'll try that.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(She should be fine on her own now. Looks like Laffey is just over there. I'll go check on her.)<br>
<br>
The sleepy bunny in question is sitting on a chair, her hand gripping a wholly average fishing rod. Her head droops from time to time, as though she's about to fall asleep.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Laffey：</span><br>
The fish aren't nibbling... I'm sleepy... Mmh...<br>
Zzzzz...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Figures.)<br>
<br>
Right as I go to wake her up, two seagulls pass by in front of me, stopping by the fishing bucket by Laffey's side.<br>
Both the birds shake their heads knowingly, then drop two fish into the bucket.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Was that Blanc and Noir? Are they helping her catch fish?<br>
(Well, she'll be fine as long as they're here. In fact, she might win despite doing nothing. Lucky her.)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fargo：</span><br>
Ah, Commander. I'm trying to focus on the fishing competition. Do you need something?<br>
<br>
Fargo wields a controller in lieu of a fishing rod, silently catching fish using four drones to her front.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
...That's no fishing rod, is it?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fargo：</span><br>
Indeed it's not. This is new fishing equipment that I invented. It allows me to control several drones at once to catch fish. It can raise fishing efficiency by up to 397.21%.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I think that's beyond the scope of regular fishing.<br>
Does the competition even allow you to use drones?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fargo：</span><br>
The rules said nothing against it, so I concluded that it's still fair and just.<br>
My current efficiency isn't so great, however. It's 21.36% below the anticipated value, and that number is getting larger.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
The drones' rotors are disturbing the waters. Have you tried flying them a little higher?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fargo：</span><br>
Hmm. A sound suggestion. I'll do that.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Now the pressure is piling on for the other competitors.)<br>
<br>
I haven't even made it to Shimanto's zone yet when I catch sight of her shikigami dragon out on the water, twisting and plunging, pulling up loads of large fish every time it surfaces.<br>
Shimanto herself is just controlling the shikigami from the shore. She waits until the dragon is laden with fish before recalling it to shake the catch into her bucket.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimanto：</span><br>
Here to watch the competition, Commander?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Yep. Pretty smart idea you had with shikigami. You'll nab first place if you keep this up.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimanto：</span><br>
Yeah, about that... There are almost no fish to be caught in this zone. It's weird.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Huh? I know they use nets to divide the fishing zones, but the fish should be able to pass under them. It shouldn't be possible for a zone to run out of fish.)<br>
<br>
Looking out toward the water at the far end, I suddenly notice a drone dangling something beneath it, moving steadily along the border of Shimanto's area.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(That explains it. It's Fargo. Seems this match is nowhere near finished.)<br>
<br>
A few hours later, a winner had emerged from the group of four. The person who advanced to the next stage was none other than...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Huan Ch'ang：</span><br>
I thought I'd be dead last, and yet, I advanced through some miraculous means.<br>
Shimanto did well in the first half, but caught nothing in the second due to one of Fargo's drones.<br>
Laffey's seagull helpers were carrying her well. That is, until a drone distracted them with some fries.<br>
As for Fargo herself, her efficiency fell off a cliff after she dispatched those two drones.<br>
Meanwhile, the advice you gave me allowed me to make a tremendous comeback.<br>
I suppose you could say this is a blowout victory for old-school fishing by hand.<br>
<br>
And thus, Huan Ch'ang made it through to the next stage. Her code of honest fishing will carry her onward and allow her to make waves in the next competition.<br>

<br>
I catch sight of a giant, open stage being finished over at the beach area.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
That's a lot of decorations it's got. Reckon it's ready for the show?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
As you see, my child, the stage is ready. All there is to do now is to wait for the performers.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Speaking of which, how many have signed up?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
Two groups as of now. Their rehearsals are going well.<br>
Given that this isn't a formal event, I welcome anyone with merely the interest to perform.<br>
Do you wish to see their rehearsals? Or would you rather perform a song by yourself?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I'll pass on the performing part and just see how they're doing.<br>
(On one side, a classical duo of Brennus and U-101. On the other, a band consisting of Formidable, Hipper, Maryland, and Cheshire.)<br>
(They look to be in the groove, so I'd better not disturb them.)<br>
Hey, what's this room? Who's using it?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Taihou：</span><br>
My Commander! Heehee – I'm so glad you found me.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Uh, sorry, wrong room.<br>
<br>
Taihou grips the doorknob firmly before I can even attempt to close the door.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Taihou：</span><br>
Would you like to listen to my performance, my Commander?<br>
If so, please take a seat somewhere over there.<br>
<br>
She takes her biwa and begins to play. The melody is clear as running water, sometimes gentle and sometimes intense. While short in duration, the piece feels as though it's been with her forever.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
That was nice. I can tell you've improved a lot. Must've taken a lot of practice.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Taihou：</span><br>
This piece is for you, my Commander – it's always playing within my heart.<br>
<br>
I took a brief break in Taihou's room. Now it's finally time for the concert to begin.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Friedrich der Große：</span><br>
Impeccable timing, my child. The concert has just started. There is a front-row seat ready for you.<br>
<br>
I'm escorted to my seat, and as I sit down, a violin and trombone duet commences.<br>
The notes of Brennus's violin are clear and cold like the solitary moon hanging high; meanwhile, U-101's trombone sounds vast as the sea at night, allowing the moonlight to reflect off it.<br>
The music fills the air, permeating time and space. No one is able to disturb it.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Never would've thought a violin and a trombone could pair so well.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Taihou：</span><br>
Which one is more touching, my Commander – their duet, or my biwa solo?<br>
There's no need to answer, heehee. I already know the answer in my heart.<br>
<br>
Next up is the band.<br>
Cheshire's vocals are delicate and gentle, while Formidable's keyboard is elegant and beautiful. Hipper's guitar is brimming with energy, and Maryland's drumbeat is mighty.<br>
Despite what you may think, the four all come together in chorus and create a wonderful performance.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Admiral Hipper：</span><br>
Whew... There you have it, Commander! Our band blew them out of the water!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-101：</span><br>
Oh yeah? This is just getting started! Our performance was pretty well-received, too!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Taihou：</span><br>
Yes, you've all put on a good show. Unfortunately for you, the winner has already been decided.<br>
I stole my Commander's heart with a solo before your little performances even began!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Admiral Hipper：</span><br>
Excuse me?! When did you do that?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-101：</span><br>
Hey! That's not fair!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Admiral Hipper：</span><br>
Either way, we're never gonna admit defeat! Cheshire, plan B! We gotta play our hearts out or it's game over!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cheshire：</span><br>
Okay! Girls, give your lives to my Owner!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Formidable：</span><br>
I'm ready whenever you are!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Maryland：</span><br>
Hell yeah! Now we're talkin'!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Hang on, what's plan B?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cheshire：</span><br>
Owner! Watch this! We're gonnaaa... change looks!<br>
<br>
They all throw off their outfits at the same time, revealing swimsuits underneath while the spotlight falls on them with perfect timing.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(HUH?!)<br>
<br>
Suddenly, the vibe shifts – Hipper's guitar goes from clean to a crushing distortion, while Maryland's drumming becomes a relentless downpour.<br>
Then Cheshire's voice erupts, bold and unfettered, as Formidable's fingers flit dexterously over the keyboard. The quartet's sound melds flawlessly with the driving synth in the background.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
That turned into an explosive performance really fast...!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Maryland：</span><br>
Hey, orchestra girls! Join in!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-101：</span><br>
You want us to accompany rock 'n' roll with classical music?!<br>
I dunno if it'll work, but I like your thinking! Let's ROCK!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Brennus：</span><br>
My strings are trembling. The world beckons me to this trial.<br>
<br>
At that point, winning or losing no longer matters. Spurred on by Cheshire's band, the improv performance becomes thoroughly unrestrained.<br>
Let the storm of rock music crash over the whole beach! Make every last grain of sand tremble with its power!<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Po：</span><br>
Someone! Anyone!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fei Yuen：</span><br>
Help uuus!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bristol：</span><br>
Nobody's coming... My gut was right back then. The cellar under the lighthouse is cursed.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jade：</span><br>
This cellar apparently is a warehouse for storing important supplies.<br>
The walls answer with almost a thud when you knock on them. They're probably made of reinforced concrete.<br>
Which is to say, nobody will hear you however loud you shout.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">San Diego：</span><br>
So we're, like, trapped?! I don't wanna spend the rest of my life in this dank place!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">L'Indomptable：</span><br>
Do not lose hope yet! Does anyone have a communicator?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jade：</span><br>
I do, but guess what – we're out of cell range!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fei Yuen：</span><br>
Waaahh! It's all Lady Yuen's fault for bringing you along! I'm never going on a risky adventure like this again!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Po：</span><br>
I messed up... I didn't expect us to actually get locked in here... I'm never making a plan like this again!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bristol：</span><br>
Part of the blame lies with me for hardly preparing at all before going on this investigation.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">San Diego：</span><br>
Farewell, good old days – I hardly knew thee!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">L'Indomptable：</span><br>
Straighten up! Don't give up! It's too soon to start wallowing in despair!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fei Yuen：</span><br>
But there's nothing to eat. We won't even last a few days down here.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Po：</span><br>
Might as well start making tallies on the wall. One for each minute...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bristol：</span><br>
I'm pretty sure it's supposed to be one per day.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">San Diego：</span><br>
Ahahaha! Since we've already given up, might as well cheer up! I'm gonna make a new song! I'll call it the Rhapsody of the End!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bristol：</span><br>
No! Don't squander your energy! When there's no food or water, you should move as little as possible to survive longer.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jade：</span><br>
Look at that – I found food!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bristol：</span><br>
You WHAT?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jade：</span><br>
It's a supply storage, so of course there's food in here. See? There's instant hot pot and rice. And they're the self-heating kind!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fei Yuen & Fu Po & San Diego：</span><br>
Hm?<br>
THANK GOD!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">San Diego：</span><br>
Never had self-heating hot pot before! Kinda crazy you can make it without fire!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Po：</span><br>
Since we've got the ingredients for it, let's have a hot pot party!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bristol：</span><br>
(Oh boy. They've all already forgotten that we're in dire straits here.)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">L'Indomptable：</span><br>
Not so fast! We must first take inventory of all the supplies!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">San Diego：</span><br>
What's it matter? We're done for anyway! Might as well have our last meal!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jade：</span><br>
Then let's at least make it a pleasant last meal!<br>
<br>
After gathering all the supplies they could find, the girls began earnestly preparing for their final hot pot party.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Po：</span><br>
*huff puff*... Having steaming hot pot with rice rules! It just sucks I won't ever have it again.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fei Yuen：</span><br>
This tomato broth goes great with the rice! But... is this really gonna be our last meal?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bristol：</span><br>
Man... It tastes so much better than I thought. Is it 'cause of the psychological effect of knowing this is the end?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">L'Indomptable：</span><br>
Om, nom... Wheffeh ih's fhe emd ow noh, confervim youf emergih if effential!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">San Diego：</span><br>
It's time for idol Sandy's final performance!<br>
This song goes out to you, friends – open sesame!<br>
<br>
CLICK!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">San Diego：</span><br>
Huh?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bristol：</span><br>
W-wait, the door OPENED?! How did you do that?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">San Diego：</span><br>
......<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fei Yuen：</span><br>
......<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Po：</span><br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chang Feng：</span><br>
Why are you all hiding in here...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">L'Indomptable：</span><br>
Are you serious?! You can simply open the door from this direction?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fei Yuen：</span><br>
Waaahhhh! Chang Fee-hee-heeeng!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Po：</span><br>
Siiis! I missed you so muuuch!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chang Feng：</span><br>
...What?<br>
Did you get locked inside here, or something? While on an "adventure" in the cellar?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Po：</span><br>
N-n-no! We just, uh, wanted to have a hot pot party with our friends...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fei Yuen：</span><br>
Um, yeah! We found this incredible thing called instant hot pot, and... Aha... haha...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chang Feng：</span><br>
Heehee. I see you're both in need of a stern lecture.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fei Yuen & Fu Po：</span><br>
EEK! HEEELP!<br>

<br>
As the night wears on, I stroll over to the pool. Moonlight caresses the water's surface, lighting up a familiar silhouette.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Trafalgar：</span><br>
Trafalgar lies face-down on a hammock, arms and legs stretched out comfortably. Her eyes calmly turn to me.<br>
Good evening, Commander. Here to relax like me?<br>
(Phew... I managed to say the line I rehearsed. Did it come out too stuffy, though?)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
More or less. I felt like taking a stroll in the sea breeze, and I ended up here.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Trafalgar：</span><br>
U-umm... The stars tonight are as pretty as I'd planned...<br>
*cough cough*! I mean, as pretty as the forecast said... Forget you heard that.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Do you check the forecast on vacation, too?</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：The stars really are pretty.</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Trafalgar：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Well, it's kind of like my job...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Trafalgar：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Th-they are...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
(She's acting a little awkward... Did she come here to be alone?)<br>
Sorry to disturb you. Don't mind me, relax.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Trafalgar：</span><br>
Huh?! W-wait!<br>
Commander!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
What? Do you need something?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Trafalgar：</span><br>
U-umm, yes... I-I mean, no...<br>
Her words trail off. She lowers her head, and her cheeks flush. A subtle shift fills the air between us.<br>
I do like being alone, but...<br>
To be honest, I want time with you, too...<br>
Chatting in the sea breeze like lovers in a movie, or...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
Sounds like a nice moment to share some secrets, don't you think?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Trafalgar：</span><br>
Y-you mean it?! I get to chat and share secrets with you?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
Of course.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Trafalgar：</span><br>
Okay, this is for you.<br>
She leans over to me and hands me a drinking glass. Her fingertip brushes against mine in the process.<br>
It's half-full of a blue drink. Pink lipstick marks are faintly visible on the rim.<br>
Now you won't have to get thirsty while we chat.<br>
(I ended up imitating a whole movie scene there... I only took one sip. The Commander's going to notice...!)<br>
H-hey, umm! I'm not trying to be weird by sharing my drink, or anything...<br>
If you don't want to drink it...<br>
W-wait! Commander, my lipstick is there... Don't drink from that side–<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
Mmm. I think we'll be talking for a long time, so I might need a refill before long.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Trafalgar：</span><br>
Ah...!<br>
Trafalgar's fluster finally subsides, and despite her surprise, she smiles.<br>
Okay!<br>
If you want to relax, you could join me...<br>
She musters her courage and offers the invitation she'd practiced so many times before.<br>
Take my hand and come up here with me. The hammock is comfy...<br>
You're worried it might break? It's okay. I chose this just for you... Ahem, I mean, for its durability...<br>
Mm... It is a little cramped with the two of us...<br>
Be careful, Commander. Hold me tight.<br>
Your safety comes first... I won't let go, and I won't let you fall.<br>
Umm... You mentioned sharing secrets before...<br>
Her breath brushes on my cheek, warming my skin.<br>
I... want to know your secrets.<br>
Please tell me everything...<br>
On this quiet night, only the ocean hears our whisperings carried by the sea breeze.<br>

<br>
One hot summer afternoon, I hungrily await my food delivery while the cicadas scream outside.<br>
DING DONG! DING DONG! Someone rings the doorbell.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gallant：</span><br>
I look at the doorbell camera and see Gallant at the door.<br>
*pant*... *pant*... Hello there, Commander! Brought the parcel you ordered!<br>
Her face is reddened, and she's breathing heavily, but her enthusiasm is as great as ever.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
Do the Port Guards do deliveries, too? This resort reconstruction work really is tough.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gallant：</span><br>
Th-that's not it!<br>
The delivery drones broke down during the vacation, so I came to help during busy hours!<br>
How else are you gonna get your pizza?<br>
I open the door and accept the box of pizza. Her breathing is still ragged.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
It's piping hot... Thanks for coming so soon in this heat! You're getting a big tip for this one.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gallant：</span><br>
No problem! Enjoy your meal, Commander! Anyway, I'm off to my next delivery!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
Take regular breaks. You're doing some serious exercise out there.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gallant：</span><br>
I'm not tired at all, Commander! Knowing that your order has safely reached your hands gives me strength!<br>
And look, I have a special-made uniform for today! It keeps me cool and protects me from the...<br>
GRRRRRRRR...<br>
She's interrupted by the loud and aggressive growling of her stomach.<br>
Ack! My body betrays me... My strength is leaving me!<br>
I might've pedalled a little too hard... Ahahaha...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
Come in and rest for a while.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gallant：</span><br>
Hmm... I shouldn't. I still have so many orders...<br>
But I reeeally wish I could rest with you... *sniffle*...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
Recover your strength, and your deliveries will get more efficient.<br>
Besides, I can't eat this whole pizza myself. I need someone to share it with.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gallant：</span><br>
Gallant's eyes light up.<br>
Okay... Okay, if you insist! I've got time until the next delivery. Just enough to get some food in me, in fact!<br>
I open the pizza box right away to avoid wasting her time. The scent of tomato sauce and cheese fills the air.<br>
Fresh-made pizza is the best! The cheese smells great, too! I already feel recharged!<br>
She gleefully devours the pizza, never noticing how her sweat-soaked jacket is sticking to her skin.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
You should clean up and take that jacket off, or else you'll catch a cold from the AC.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gallant：</span><br>
Ah! But my hands are covered in cheese and grease... Sorry, can you help me?<br>
I remove her wet jacket and wipe her down with a dry towel.<br>
Hahaha... That tickles!<br>
Haha, haha... I-I'm fine! Hurry and eat with me, Commander! It won't taste as good if it gets cold!<br>
I'll even feed you! Here, say ahh!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
Mm... Delicious! I'm going to need another slice.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Gallant：</span><br>
Aaaah, hey! You're taking all my toppings!<br>
*munch!*<br>

<br>
As I'm strolling around the villa, I notice the light is on in the billiards room.<br>
Curious who might be in there, I push the half-open door and go in.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Taihou：</span><br>
My Commander~ Did you come here to see me?<br>
In the dim room, Taihou reclines lazily on a pool table, her face showing signs of weariness.<br>
Her black hair is scattered across the table like a splash of water radiating from her beautiful features.<br>
Her wine-red bunny girl costume reflects the faint light as a ruby would.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Just checking on things...</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：I noticed the light was on...</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''I just decided to check on the billiards room.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Taihou：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''No, no. I'm certain that you sensed I was here.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Otherwise, you wouldn't have unconsciously wandered to my side! Heehee.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''I came to see what was going on in here, since the light was on.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Taihou：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Heheh, of course you would notice the hint I left behind for you!<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''After all, our hearts are so in tune with each other...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Taihou：</span><br>
She holds a pool cue tightly in her arms, her cheeks flushed with an intoxicated glow.<br>
When I approach her, the rich aroma of wine quickly explains why.<br>
I've been trying to get better at billiards, but it's just so hard to learn without a teacher...<br>
And I get awfully bored when I'm all alone...<br>
Her long, slender legs swing from the edge of the table, causing her red high heels to tap against my leg.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
If you want to learn, I can teach you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Taihou：</span><br>
Heehee. I knew you'd understand my needs.<br>
I waited all this time for my Commander to finally come and give me intimate, personal instruction~<br>
I'll return the favor by doing any little thing you want me to do♥<br>
Her finger hooks around the hem of my shirt, and she throws herself into my arms.<br>
I need sooo much more guidance from you, my Commander♥<br>
Our skin touches, and I'm struck by her warmth and softness.<br>
I love your warmth, my Commander...<br>
Blushing a vivid red, she hands me the pool cue that she'd been clutching to.<br>
Her body heat still clings to it, and the grip is just a tiny bit moist.<br>
I hope you like mine, too...<br>
Before I can go around the table to show her an example stance, she wraps both legs around my waist.<br>
Won't you please "teach" me like this, my Commander?♥<br>
Her lower half is practically burning now, and she trembles with barely contained excitement.<br>
Please, my Commander~ If you're going to teach me, then you need to show me how it's done.<br>
We lock eyes. She licks her lips ecstatically.<br>
How do you hold the cue? From what position do you strike?<br>
How do you thrust your tool? How do you take control...<br>
I want to learn, up close and personal...<br>
Come on... Teach me, my Commander♥<br>

*knock knock*<br>
After receiving a message from Formidable, I headed to the studio where her photo shoot had just ended.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Formidable：</span><br>
C-Commander? Get in here! And close the door behind you, please!<br>
As soon as I go inside, I'm stunned by the unbelievable scene before me.<br>
She sits within an oversized picture frame. A vivid blue ribbon hangs from her beautiful neck.<br>
Her hair droops like a waterfall, shining like exquisite silk under the spotlight.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
(She's like a work of art, but for some reason, she seems tense.)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Formidable：</span><br>
When she sees that I'm inside, the anxiety in her eyes instantly disappears. Her relief is evident.<br>
Oh, Commander... You're finally here.<br>
She starts to stand up, but then, she gets flustered, turns red, and sits back down.<br>
...H-hmph. You're late!<br>
You're my Commander, so you need to be ready to come see me at a moment's notice!<br>
Her white dress sways with her movements, drawing ever more of my attention to the skin beneath.<br>
But the frame she's sitting on rocks, too. She rushes to grab it with both hands, but she suddenly freezes up.<br>
U-umm... It's untied...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
Sorry, what?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Formidable：</span><br>
My dress! My dress came untied!<br>
If I move at all... It's going to fall off completely...<br>
And this frame is unstable. I need to hold on tight, or else...<br>
D-don't look at me like that, please! Even Royal ladies are only born with two hands!<br>
Unable to watch her struggle, I run over to help her.<br>
Each time my fingers brush against her trembling body, her smooth skin reddens a little more.<br>
Please be careful...<br>
Her uneven breathing warms my cheek and ear.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Is it tight at all?</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：Is it too loose?</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Formidable：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''It's just right... Wait, are you accusing me of having gained weight?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''No. This strap is long, so I was thinking of tying another knot into it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Formidable：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''It's okay. Tie it a little tighter, if you want.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''As a Royal lady, I can withstand this.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Formidable：</span><br>
I tie the strap again, finally satisfying her.<br>
T-thank you...<br>
M-more importantly! Did you see that last photo? Did it look nice?<br>
She shyly retracts her long legs, tipped with silver high heels.<br>
Blue fabric trails down her waist, perfectly outlining her leg.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
You did great, but I could tell you were nervous.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Formidable：</span><br>
Hmph! Be a little nicer, why don't you? I went through all this effort–<br>
She tries to kick me with the tip of her high heel, but the shoe suddenly slips off.<br>
I try to catch it, but I end up grabbing her delicate ankle instead.<br>
C-Commander?!<br>
When I'm about to let go, she puts a hand on my shoulder and leans in close.<br>
Urk... I-it came untied again...<br>
You have to stay with me... until it's tied good and tight, okay?<br>
Please, Commander?<br>

<br>
One calm afternoon, I set out for a nice swim by the beach, but a beautiful melody coming from the pool area stopped me in my tracks.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:531}：</span><br>
The sun shines through the palm leaves and onto the water's surface, lighting up a certain someone's figure.<br>
Hm hmm♪ Oh, little one?<br>
Did my tune of love guide you here?<br>
Friedrich Carl turns to me. Water droplets fall from her bangs and shoulders in the sun, creating sprinkles of light when they hit her inflatable bed.<br>
Noticing my arrival, she splashes the water a few times to guide the bed closer to me.<br>
Mm, it's too bright to see you clearly...<br>
Come to my side, little one~ Let me touch you as love touches us all...<br>
Heehee, now we can hold hands~<br>
Your coming has set my heart aripple.<br>
Every wave of love surges between us through our burning, passionate touch.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：I think I feel it.</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：You're not kidding. It's too hot.</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Your hands feel really hot from the sunlight.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Are you sure you're not overheating?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:531}：</span><br>
Hmm... Now that you mention it, I do feel a little lightheaded...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
Be careful sunbathing in this heat. Let's make sure you don't get sunburned, okay?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:531}：</span><br>
Aww... My poor little one worried about me.<br>
Your hot, passionate love is making me dizzy from happiness.<br>
Then put suntan lotion on for me, won't you, little one?<br>
But first... Can you clean me up a little?<br>
Only a clean body can truly appreciate your loving nourishment~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
I'll go get a towel.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:531}：</span><br>
I take a clean towel from the poolside rack and press it against her back. It darkens from wetness in no time.<br>
I go from her shoulder blades, to her waist, and finally to her thick thighs. Each time I drape the towel over her, it outlines her gorgeous curves.<br>
You're too gentle, little one...<br>
Heehee... That one tickled. Did you do that on purpose?<br>
I'll have to lovingly punish you for that~<br>
By the time I've finished drying her off, her skin looks even more radiant in the sunlight.<br>
Hmm? Already done wiping down my back?<br>
Then get the front for me, too, little one.<br>
She looks up at me and undoes the straps of her swimsuit.<br>
Before I can react, she seizes my wrist, and with just a little bit of force...<br>
...The inflatable pool bed shakes, and I'm lying in her arms.<br>
Heehee. That's enough standing around, little one~ As two evangelists of love, we need to be more direct with each other.<br>
Welcome to my little island of love~<br>
Come closer, now. We can't stay balanced unless we're right on top of each other.<br>
We don't want me getting all soaked again right after you toweled me down.<br>
Now, little one, keep going...<br>
Dry off my front, and then, you may douse me with your creamy lotion of love♪<br>

{{折叠面板|标题=Trapper in the Changing Room|选项=24|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<br>
With my work done for now, I decided to take a little break at the beach.<br>
The changing room looks empty, so I go in to change into my swimwear.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">???：</span><br>
Guess who!<br>
<br>
The playful voice is accompanied by a unique fragrance.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Trinidad?</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：I recognize that scent.</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Trinidad：</span><br>
Well done~ I knew you'd guess right, Commander.<br>
My eyes are uncovered, and the long hair tickling my neck finally relents.<br>
I turn to follow the scent and find that Trinidad has already retreated behind a curtain in the changing room.<br>
Here I thought I'd surprise you with my swimsuit... I didn't think you'd come this early.<br>
I notice her flushed cheeks and curse my poor timing.<br>
Hmm? Oh...<br>
Heheh, this might actually be the perfect opportunity after all.<br>
It's just such a shame that I already changed into my swimsuit!<br>
Tadaaa♪<br>
She throws open the curtain, boldly exposing herself to me.<br>
That's not all – she also sticks her tongue out triumphantly.<br>
White frills conceal a red swimsuit, like a metaphor for passion hidden beneath an innocent guise.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
Very nice. It suits you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Trinidad：</span><br>
She looks a little stunned, as if my reaction was calmer than she was hoping for.<br>
Oh. Strange... You don't look surprised at all.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Well, there's a mirror behind you.</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：Turn around.</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''There's a mirror behind you. I already knew, sorry.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Trinidad：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Oh, no... I'm a poor hunter for not noticing that.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''But I didn't expect that you were also a hunter lurking in the shadows...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''I think you'll see the reason behind you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Trinidad：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Hmm? Aha, so that's it!<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''If you knew, why didn't you tell me? You're such a meanie~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Trinidad：</span><br>
Either way, prying into a girl's secrets is hardly something to be proud of.<br>
You'd better make this up to me, Commander...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
Make it up to you? How, exactly?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Trinidad：</span><br>
Hmm... First, turn away and let me think for a minute.<br>
As soon as I turn my back to her, her warm breath and something soft crawl up my spine.<br>
I then catch the familiar fragrance of her hair as her arms gently wrap around my collar.<br>
Heheh... You're still too soft to be a hunter.<br>
Your willingness to show weakness in front of me makes it too hard to resist.<br>
You know, even a hunter can become the prey in the face of a stronger predator.<br>
Her fingertips stroke my cheek.<br>
Since you're on such good behaviour, I'll let you off easy. All you have to do is have fun at the beach with me.<br>
But you still haven't changed into your swimsuit yet. Why so slow, Commander?<br>
I'll just have to help you... with my own two hands♪<br>

<br>
One beautiful afternoon, Lion and I take a peaceful walk to the beach.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lion：</span><br>
Mmm. Fantastic weather.<br>
She sits comfortably on a beach chair left in the sand.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
Taking a break already? That isn't like you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lion：</span><br>
Please. I'm only availing myself of the sun's bounty.<br>
Besides, this spot has the best view of the beach.<br>
She stretches, satisfied, and lets out a big yawn.<br>
Her ruffled white swimsuit draws attention to her fair skin, which shines like a pearl in the sunlight.<br>
Hmm? Commander, I notice your eyes lingering...<br>
Is someone worried that these rays will damage my skin?<br>
In that case... Help me put some lotion on.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
I'd be happy to.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lion：</span><br>
She takes suntan lotion out of her bag and hands it to me before removing her beach shawl.<br>
Here's an idea. Apply it well enough...<br>
And I might just untie my swimsuit for you... If that's what you want.<br>
She grins and hooks a finger around the strap of her bikini top.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：That's not necessary.</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：What if something happens?</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''I practiced putting suntan lotion on. Sit back and relax, and that's reward enough for me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lion：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Heheh... Alright, then. Sounds good to me.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''But if you satisfy me, there might just be a surprise waiting for you.<br>

'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''If something happens, there might be trouble.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lion：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Such as...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Like an enemy attack? You can't exactly fight like that.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lion：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Never showing vulnerability, even in such a relaxed moment... You really are a warrior, Commander.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''I like you more and more.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lion：</span><br>
I gently spread lotion on her skin, leaving an enticing luster on her delicate curves.<br>
I can feel her soft, springy skin against my palm. For some reason, she's trembling just a little.<br>
By the time her stomach and thighs are fully covered in oily lotion, I notice that she's a tinge hotter than before.<br>
Just as I finish my work, she presses something cold against my lips. It smells like fruit.<br>
Good work, Commander. Open up.<br>
This is your reward. Accept it with confidence.<br>
You and I are the only ones on this beach. Relax a little.<br>
Of course, if you're not satisfied... then I'll feed you as much as you want.<br>
We have plenty of fruit left, after all. Hahaha!<br>
That look in your eyes tells me you were expecting something different.<br>
She puts down the plump, juicy fruit and raises a drinking glass this time.<br>
The ice and mint leaves in the cup rock with her motions.<br>
At the tip of the straw is a light bite mark, indicating that someone has already drunk from it.<br>
Lion seems to read my mind. With a mischievous gleam in her eye, she licks her lips, revealing a sharp fang.<br>
Heheh... Cool down a little while you still can, Commander.<br>
You've realized what your real reward is, haven't you?<br>
You're not the kind of person to stop things now.<br>
Don't worry. We still have ample time together.<br>
Forget everything else and follow your heart.<br>

<br>
On one quiet afternoon, I packed a bag and came to the beach.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Monarch：</span><br>
Commander?!<br>
Noticing my approach, Monarch sits up from her swim ring and turns to look at me.<br>
Despite her usual stern presence, she seems unusually awkward in front of unexpected guests.<br>
Water drips from her shoulder under the dazzling sunlight.<br>
Commander... Why are you here?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
Just felt like checking out the renewed beach. You?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Monarch：</span><br>
I'm just... watching the ocean.<br>
I follow her evasive gaze and notice a dripping-wet beach ball.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
Do you like playing with beach balls?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Monarch：</span><br>
Wha?!<br>
Oh, no... Did you see me?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
I saw you were having a great time, so I didn't want to interrupt.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Monarch：</span><br>
She shifts awkwardly. Water rolls down her chest and drips onto the swim ring.<br>
I just... wanted to give it a try.<br>
To warm up, or something, I guess...<br>
Though she turns away, her blushing ears tell me everything.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：(Hand her suntan lotion.)</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：(Give her a drink.)</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''So you're finished warming up? How about I help you with your skincare?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Monarch：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''I'm... I'm fine for now.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Don't act all sad. I just don't need it YET.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''So you're finished warming up? How about cooling down a bit now?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Monarch：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''I'm... I'm not thirsty yet.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Wait. I just said not YET.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Monarch：</span><br>
Her blush fades a little, and she turns back to me.<br>
Why did you come looking for me?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
Because I knew you were waiting for me. Whenever you need me, I'll always come running.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Monarch：</span><br>
...<br>
Thank you, Commander. I appreciate that.<br>
Can you stay a little longer, then? We can play with beach balls together...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
Gladly. I'll warn you, I'm no master beach ball handler.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Monarch：</span><br>
That's just fine. I know how to help.<br>
Before she even finishes that sentence, she takes my wrist.<br>
Let's make things interesting to motivate you.<br>
If you lose, you have to do something for me.<br>
But if you win... then I have to do THREE things for you.<br>
How's that? Good deal, isn't it?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
I'll give it my best shot.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Monarch：</span><br>
Heheh. I won't give you any mercy.<br>
You said you'd always come running... Well, that won't be necessary, because you're staying with me.<br>

<br>
With Shimanto leading the way, I follow a rugged mountain path into the depths of the forest.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimanto：</span><br>
Nearby, a waterfall cascades down from a hundred meters, gathering into a crystal-clear stream.<br>
Heheh, how do you like it? It took me a lot of time and effort to find this domain of raw natural energy.<br>
Training here is far more effective than usual!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
...Training?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimanto：</span><br>
Yes!<br>
Can you guess how the Dragon God trains?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：(Waterfall training?)</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：(Skipping stones?)</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Do you train your willpower by meditating under the waterfall?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimanto：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Huh? Some people do that, but it doesn't really suit me...<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''I-I mean, it hurts.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Do you train your coordination by skipping stones on the water?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimanto：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Wait, that sounds like fun... U-um, I mean, we're not here to play!<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''A-anyway, just come with me!<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''The Dragon God will show you how we immortals train!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimanto：</span><br>
Her long legs gently cut through the sparkling water, and her dragon tail splashes along behind her.<br>
Red fabric envelops her slender neck, accentuating the fairness of her skin.<br>
The delicate white shawl draped around her adds to her ethereal beauty.<br>
The Dragon God guides me to the riverbank, where we sit cross-legged in the water.<br>
Harken to the sound of the rushing waters. Recognize it as the murmurs of the mountain stream.<br>
Immerse yourself in its motion. Let it cleanse you of impurity.<br>
Let your heart sink into its depths, and find tranquility deep within.<br>
Realize that this is the ultimate elixir to cure heart and soul...<br>
Suddenly, I notice that she's leaning on me a little.<br>
Perhaps it's the laving of the stream water, but her once-fair skin is now suffused with an alluring pink tint.<br>
She's warmer than the chilly water, and she's unbelievably soft to boot.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
This is surprisingly pleasant and soothing...<br>
Isn't this just ecotherapy, though? I'm not sure I'd call it training.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimanto：</span><br>
Huh? I-I guess you're not wrong...<br>
It doesn't matter, though! All training comes down to the same fundamental truth.<br>
It's all about promoting health through tempering the body and mind!<br>
Consider the many methods of training out there as blessings bestowed by the Dragon God...<br>
Train diligently, and with gratitude!<br>
Seeing how serious she looks, I suddenly think... even if this is just ecotherapy, that's no problem at all.<br>
<br>
Once we finish the so-called training, we go back to her room together.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimanto：</span><br>
As soon as we enter, the Dragon God lies down on the soft futon and begins to relax. She rests her head in one hand, and her silver tail swishes leisurely back and forth.<br>
Her otherworldly air from before is all but gone.<br>
It still isn't dinnertime yet... How should we pass the time?<br>
Hey, Commander. There's something I've been wondering.<br>
What does it feel like to serve another?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：(Answer her.)</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：(Brush her off.)</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''It takes a lot of effort.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimanto：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''But you still choose to do so despite that...<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Hmm. Now I'm even more curious...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''You don't really need to know.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimanto：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Hm? If you're trying to make me less curious, it isn't working.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''The Dragon God is as bored as can be.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''I won't let this go until you give me a detailed answer.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
Okay, then how about you give it a try?<br>
Experience will tell you more than I can.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimanto：</span><br>
Oh, yes! That does sound more fun! Okay...<br>
Welcome back, Commander.<br>
What would you like first? Dinner? A bath? Or... Hmm...<br>
She cuts herself off, struggling to recall the rest of the cliché line that she picked up from who-knows-what.<br>
It seems the Dragon God's journey to master the art of service is filled with obstacles.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
I choose dinner.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shimanto：</span><br>
Huh? There is no dinner. I can't even cook.<br>
There is tea, if you want it. Should we start with that?<br>
If you're that hungry, I can deign to bestow sweets upon you.<br>
But don't eat too much, or else I won't have any left for me.<br>
She's back to her usual self in no time.<br>
Something suddenly occurs to her, and she pats the spot next to her.<br>
If you're tired, lie down with me.<br>
I'll serve you just the way you like.<br>
Heheh... I saw that look of surprise.<br>
Don't overthink things. It's a good time to just relax and leave the rest to me.<br>
She flutters her eyelashes at me. Her pearl-white cheeks have an intoxicating blush to them.<br>
Come on... There's plenty of time until dinner.<br>
Since we're here... Come and enjoy the Dragon God's service for once♪<br>
