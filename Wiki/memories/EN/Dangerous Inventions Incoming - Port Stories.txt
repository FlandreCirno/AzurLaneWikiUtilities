Port - Lala's Improvised Laboratory<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nana Astar Deviluke：</span><br>
Lala, you've been tinkering with that thing for ages. Are you ever gonna be done?<br>
*yaaawn*... I need some sleep.<br>
<br>
Nana yawned, her boredom plain on her face.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Momo Belia Deviluke：</span><br>
Let's wait a little longer. Our big sister is working very hard for us right now.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lala Satalin Deviluke：</span><br>
Yep! Just a little more! And I think I've already found a solution, too!<br>
Momo, can you bring me the tools from over there?<br>
Oh, and Nana, hold this here for me!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nana Astar Deviluke：</span><br>
Yeah, yeah.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Momo Belia Deviluke：</span><br>
Yes, Lala.<br>
<br>
Shortly after...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lala Satalin Deviluke：</span><br>
Huh? That's weird... It still doesn't work.<br>
<br>
Various oddly-shaped parts lay scattered on the floor around her.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Momo Belia Deviluke：</span><br>
Lala, is there...<br>
<br>
*knock* *knock*<br>
A visitor at the door cut off Momo's words.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Belfast：</span><br>
Pardon the intrusion. I've come bearing afternoon tea.<br>
<br>
Outside the door, one perfectly elegant maid bowed politely. The dining cart behind her was lined with exquisite sweets.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lala Satalin Deviluke：</span><br>
Ooh~ Tea time already?<br>
I didn't even notice!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nana Astar Deviluke：</span><br>
Yeah, because you've had your head in your inventions for hours.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Momo Belia Deviluke：</span><br>
Agreed. Lala, have you considered taking a little break?<br>
Thank you very much, Belfast.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Belfast：</span><br>
It's my pleasure. Incidentally, I couldn't help but notice that you seem to be struggling somewhat...<br>
If there's anything I can assist you with, please don't hesitate to ask.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nana Astar Deviluke：</span><br>
Well, do you know any girls who are good at inventions and repairing machines?<br>
If we had someone knowledgeable on hand, that might just fix Lala's problem right away.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lala Satalin Deviluke：</span><br>
Yeah! If I had an assistant, I could solve this a lot faster!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Belfast：</span><br>
I understand your needs. Someone skilled at repairing machines who's willing and able to come right away...<br>
<br>
The head maid sent a few messages and nodded to the Devilukes again.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Belfast：</span><br>
I've done what I can for the time being. Please enjoy some afternoon tea and rest a while, and I will introduce you to your new helper.<br>
<br>
After tea, Belfast showed the Deviluke sisters to da Vinci's place.<br>
As for da Vinci herself, she was leaning into a strange machine such that only her lower body was exposed.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
Sorry, sorry~ I thought I'd be able to get this done quick...<br>
Wait a little for me! Hmm... Do this, and... Okay, done!<br>
<br>
She finally wriggled out of the machine.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Momo Belia Deviluke：</span><br>
Leonardo da Vinci, we need your help. Our sister Lala is struggling to repair a machine, and she could use an assistant.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lala Satalin Deviluke：</span><br>
I know we have to talk about the whole reason we're here, but...<br>
I'm more curious about THAT! Da Vinci, what's that thing you're tinkering with?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
Oh, this baby? She's my newest invention♪<br>
I call her the Fully Automatic Tactical Adjustor!<br>
If you feed it your tactics, it'll simulate them with various logical algorithms and automatically correct any mistakes~<br>
I'm still calibrating it, though, so it's a little buggy...<br>
<br>
She rubbed the back of her neck bashfully.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lala Satalin Deviluke：</span><br>
If you don't mind, could I take a little look at it?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
Huh? Didn't you come to ask for MY help, though?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lala Satalin Deviluke：</span><br>
Yeah! But maybe I'll get some unexpected insight if I look inside your machine!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Leonardo da Vinci：</span><br>
Well, well...<br>
<br>
Fully absorbed in their talk of inventions, the two geniuses totally forgot why Lala had come.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nana Astar Deviluke：</span><br>
Welp, we've lost her.<br>
*sigh*... At this rate, we won't get to business for a while.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Momo Belia Deviluke：</span><br>
There's still plenty of time to repair Questy MacGuffin.<br>
Making new friends is nice. This might be good for her.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nana Astar Deviluke：</span><br>
But we're gonna be waiting forEVER...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Belfast：</span><br>
If the two of you are bored, would you like me to procure a tabletop game or two for you to enjoy?<br>
<br>
Nana and Momo looked at each other. After a moment, they smiled.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nana & Momo：</span><br>
Yes, please!<br>

<br>
Port - Outdoor Gym<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bremerton：</span><br>
Get a load of THIS one!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Baltimore：</span><br>
Heh, easy return!<br>
<br>
Bremerton and Baltimore were in the midst of a heated game of tennis.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nana Astar Deviluke：</span><br>
Whoa... That Baltimore girl is even faster than a pro player!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Haruna Sairenji：</span><br>
Bremerton's predictive skills are incredible, too. She reacts with such precision.<br>
<br>
When Nana and Haruna happened to pass by, they stopped and gawked.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nana Astar Deviluke：</span><br>
This is really stoking my competitive spirit!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Haruna Sairenji：</span><br>
I'm in the mood for a good workout, too!<br>
Huh? You know, it looks like these courts are free for anyone to use.<br>
See, there are rackets over there with a sign that says anyone can play with them...<br>
<br>
The two of them picked up rackets and swung them around for a moment.<br>
And then, a tennis ball came flying at them from the courts!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nana Astar Deviluke：</span><br>
Watch out!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Haruna Sairenji：</span><br>
Ah...!<br>
<br>
Haruna reflexively swung the racket, perfectly returning the ball.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bremerton：</span><br>
Wow, nice!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Baltimore：</span><br>
Sorry! That was a really bad shot on my part...<br>
Umm, are you okay? Did it hit you at all?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Haruna Sairenji：</span><br>
No, I'm fine! Really, we should apologize for staring... I hope we didn't bother you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Baltimore：</span><br>
Not at all!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bremerton：</span><br>
Having spectators just makes a good match more exciting♪<br>
But really, that was an impressive return! You have a real knack for tennis, Haruna.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Baltimore：</span><br>
Yeah... Not bad at all.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bremerton：</span><br>
Y'know, Baltimore, we won't improve much if we just keep playing each other. How about we bring these two in?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Baltimore：</span><br>
I wouldn't mind, but they're the ones you need permission from. Haruna, Nana?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Haruna Sairenji：</span><br>
Sure! I love tennis, so I'd be happy to play!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nana Astar Deviluke：</span><br>
Me, too! I've been in the mood to play.<br>
<br>
Thus, with Haruna and Nana's participation, they had a doubles game on their hands.<br>
Soon after...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Baltimore：</span><br>
Phew... We found ourselves some formidable opponents.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bremerton：</span><br>
Heheh, this is the kind of stuff that makes sports more exciting♪<br>
<br>
After a quick warm-up, Haruna and Nana quickly got into the groove of things and put up a worthy fight against Baltimore and Bremerton.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nana Astar Deviluke：</span><br>
You two are great, too! Right, Haruna?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Haruna Sairenji：</span><br>
Y-yeah...! Your shots are strong, and you have so much stamina...<br>
But we're not done yet!<br>
<br>
Haruna took a deep breath, adjusted her stance, stepped forward, and served again.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bremerton：</span><br>
Not bad~ Just for that, you get to see my new secret move!<br>
<br>
Bremerton's powerful smash sent the ball flying at astonishing speed... and directly into the bushes in the distance.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bremerton：</span><br>
Aw, man... Still can't control my secret move well enough, I guess... Heheh.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Scared Kitty：</span><br>
Mreow!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Haruna Sairenji：</span><br>
Eeek!<br>
<br>
A cat, startled by the call, leapt out of the bushes and pounced onto Haruna. It was too sudden for her to brace herself, so she was knocked onto her butt.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nana Astar Deviluke：</span><br>
Haruna! Are you okay?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Haruna Sairenji：</span><br>
I-I am... But the poor kitty...<br>
<br>
The cat had burrowed into her clothes and would not let her go now.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Baltimore：</span><br>
Hm? Another escapee from the cat café, huh?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bremerton：</span><br>
Guess I scared it with my sick moves... We'd better get it off of you, though.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Haruna Sairenji：</span><br>
Aaaah!<br>
<br>
Just as everyone ran over to help Haruna...<br>
...The cat burrowed even deeper, scared by the commotion.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Haruna Sairenji：</span><br>
Wh-what now? Ooh...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bremerton：</span><br>
I called Jean Bart. She'll be here right away!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Haruna Sairenji：</span><br>
Okay, but what do we do until then?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Baltimore：</span><br>
All you can do is wait!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Scared Kitty：</span><br>
Mreow!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Haruna Sairenji：</span><br>
Ulp... O-okay... Thank you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nana Astar Deviluke：</span><br>
So, who won the match?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Baltimore：</span><br>
Well... Including Bremerton's flub at the end, I guess it's basically a draw.<br>
But I think we know who really won today!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Scared Kitty：</span><br>
Mreow!<br>

Port - Academy<br>
Yui Kotegawa marched through the halls of the academy, ever vigilant of her surroundings.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yui Kotegawa：</span><br>
Good. Everything here is in perfect order. It's just as peaceful as the student admin back at Sainan High School.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">？？？：</span><br>
Aaaaaah!<br>
Catch that thing! Don't let my meal get awaaay!<br>
<br>
A sudden cry from the kitchen down the hall broke through the peace and quiet.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yui Kotegawa：</span><br>
Over there...<br>
<br>
She rushed for the kitchen.<br>
When she got there, she flung the door open–<br>
And before her eyes was something that could only be described as a mess.<br>
Scattered cooking implements. Ayase, scrambling to follow an eel that rolled all over the floor. And Asanagi, holding a pot lid in its path, ready to ambush.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Asanagi：</span><br>
Heheh. Great timing, Kotegawa!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yui Kotegawa：</span><br>
Umm, what's going on here...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ayase：</span><br>
Urgh... Dumb, slippery eel...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yui Kotegawa：</span><br>
I... see?<br>
I'm not sure I can catch it myself, but I'll do my best to help!<br>
<br>
Yui stifled her breathing and positioned herself to corner it alongside Ayase, hoping to drive it into a place where Asanagi could catch it in the pot lid.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Asanagi：</span><br>
Good, good! Keep it up! I'm ready to catch the fiend!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yui Kotegawa：</span><br>
Shh....<br>
<br>
Yui gave a quiet signal and took a single, decisive step forward...<br>
But then, the eel – which had just been rolling and slithering until now – somehow jumped directly up into the air...<br>
...And landed right onto Yui.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yui Kotegawa：</span><br>
Eeeeeek!<br>
G-geez! Why'd this have to happen to me?!<br>
<br>
The more she scrambled to grab the eel, the more easily it slipped out of her grasp.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yui Kotegawa：</span><br>
Ewww, it's so slippery... Gross!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">？？？：</span><br>
Don't you worry! Liverpool's here to save the day!<br>
<br>
The Royal Maid Liverpool gallantly rushed onto the scene and suppressed the feisty eel in no time.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yui Kotegawa：</span><br>
Thanks... You basically saved my life.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Asanagi：</span><br>
Hah! You have my gratitude – for now!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Liverpool：</span><br>
No problem at all♪ By the way, are you cooking that eel?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ayase：</span><br>
Y-Yes... But in my clumsiness, I accidentally let it go...<br>
I even scared poor Kotegawa here, and it ended up with her getting her clothes dirty... Oh, I'm so sorry.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yui Kotegawa：</span><br>
Don't worry about it. I can just wash these.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ayase：</span><br>
I insist on worrying about it! You're a dear guest to our port, and here I go causing you trouble.<br>
I-I know! I'm going to cook this eel. Would you like some as apology?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yui Kotegawa：</span><br>
Well...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Liverpool：</span><br>
Heheh, nobody cooks an eel without me in the equation!<br>
I won't just teach you to cook it – Kotegawa, I'll impart to you the ultimate secrets of eel cuisine☆<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Asanagi：</span><br>
Hey! Who said anything about teaching?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Liverpool：</span><br>
As they say, "Teach a shipgirl to fish, you feed her for a lifetime."<br>
Then, when you go back to your own world, you can remember my teachings and introduce them to your people♪<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Asanagi：</span><br>
I hate how much sense that makes...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ayase：</span><br>
E-excuse me! Liverpool, could you please teach me, too?<br>
Umm, Atago and the others tell me that being a good cook is part of being a good bride...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yui Kotegawa：</span><br>
A-a good bride?! I don't...<br>
<br>
Despite her initial attempts to refuse, Yui was overwhelmed by their enthusiasm.<br>
As such, she ended up staying, being treated to eel, and learning how to cook it Liverpool-style.<br>

Port - Pool<br>
After wandering around in search of something fun to do, Nana found herself near the port's pool.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nana Astar Deviluke：</span><br>
Lala did say there was a great outdoor pool here...<br>
Apparently they use special tech to make the water a comfy temperature all year, and the water is always clean...<br>
Well, now I wanna swim. I didn't bring a swimsuit, but I might as well take a look around!<br>
<br>
She followed the signs and headed over to the pool.<br>
The air around the pool was pleasant and refreshing.<br>
A few friends from port were swimming at their own paces.<br>
Takao's arms drew perfect arcs as she swam, and Bluegill traveled quickly yet gracefully in the water.<br>
Zara meanwhile swam slowly and elegantly on her back, as if enjoying the water's embrace.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nana Astar Deviluke：</span><br>
Whoa... Everyone here is so good.<br>
They're just relaxing, but they look like they could win a race.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zara：</span><br>
Oh? Nana?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Takao：</span><br>
How long have you been watching us?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nana Astar Deviluke：</span><br>
S-sorry! I didn't mean to gawk...<br>
It's just that you're all such good swimmers!<br>
<br>
Realizing that she was being impolite, she got flustered and tried to explain herself.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bluegill：</span><br>
Hey, that's nothing to apologize over!<br>
You came to swim too, didn't you?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nana Astar Deviluke：</span><br>
I'm still not sure... I was kind of just taking a look, I guess...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Takao：</span><br>
Are you... a poor swimmer, perhaps?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nana Astar Deviluke：</span><br>
No way!<br>
I'm actually pretty darn good at it!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zara：</span><br>
In that case, why don't you join us?<br>
It can't be that fun to sit around and watch.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nana Astar Deviluke：</span><br>
But I don't have a swimsuit...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zara：</span><br>
Use one of mine. I haven't even worn it before, so don't worry about it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nana Astar Deviluke：</span><br>
I-it's obviously not gonna fit...!<br>
<br>
Nana struggled over the question for a while, but in the end, she decided that she wanted to swim too much to care.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nana Astar Deviluke：</span><br>
Welp... I can just change clothes after, I guess.<br>
<br>
She muttered in resignation, resolved herself, and jumped into the pool.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nana Astar Deviluke：</span><br>
Phew... Swimming is the best!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bluegill：</span><br>
Hm? You were all unsure before. Was there something other than the swimsuit on your mind?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nana Astar Deviluke：</span><br>
N-no!<br>
<br>
Nana immediately started swimming with beautiful form, hoping to avoid further questioning.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zara：</span><br>
Heheh. I knew it – you're a great swimmer!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Takao：</span><br>
Might I ask how you inferred that?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Zara：</span><br>
Look at her muscles. I could tell she was a good swimmer from that alone.<br>
That's why I didn't say anything before.<br>
She's a guest, so she must have some residual shyness.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Takao：</span><br>
I see...<br>
Nana, consider this your home. Relax. We welcome you to join us any time you want!<br>
<br>
Takao raised her voice so that Nana would be sure to hear her.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nana Astar Deviluke：</span><br>
Ooh... If that's how you feel, then I'll take you up on that offer!<br>
Let's race! Who here is the fastest swimmer?<br>
<br>
With that, she swam off at max speed with a big smile on her face.<br>
The sun reflected on the rippling water, and the pool was once again filled with joyous laughter.<br>

<br>
Port - Dorms<br>
Golden Darkness walked down the hall, hoping to head to the shopping area and find a taiyaki seller.<br>
But suddenly, she heard an odd rustling from a nearby room.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Golden Darkness：</span><br>
Hmm?<br>
...I should check it out.<br>
<br>
When she cautiously opened the door, she found the inside of the room pitch-black.<br>
In the darkness, she could make out slight breathing and the rustling of clothes. This only made her warier.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Golden Darkness：</span><br>
...<br>
<br>
Golden Darkness slowly, carefully entered the room...<br>
But then, something attacked her!<br>
She backflipped almost instinctively, smoothly dodging the assault...<br>
Yet several shuriken came flying her way – and a few of them came dangerously close to cutting her.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Golden Darkness：</span><br>
...Who's there?<br>
<br>
She immediately took a defensive posture and fixed her eyes sharply on the dark room, ready to counterattack.<br>
But the touch-and-go situation was diffused as the lights were turned on.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akatsuki：</span><br>
Oh, Miss Yami! A-apologies, I thought you were Bell...!<br>
Aaah, I'm s-s-so sorry! Miss Yami, a-are you hurt at all...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Golden Darkness：</span><br>
I'm okay.<br>
But you should practice more. Your attack was too hesitant and lacked strength.<br>
<br>
She approached Akatsuki, picked up the shuriken, and handed them over.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akatsuki：</span><br>
Urk... Yes, my ninjutsu is still unpolished. That's why I'm training as such...<br>
Maybe trying to train in the darkness from the outset was a poor decision...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bell：</span><br>
Huh? Akatsuki, I thought we were practicing ninjutsu with the lights off? Why are they on–<br>
Wait, huh? Yami? Why are you here?!<br>
<br>
She seemed surprised to find Golden Darkness here.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Golden Darkness：</span><br>
...Did you two agree to train in the dark?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bell：</span><br>
Yep! Akatsuki comes in first and hides, and when I come in, she tries to ambush me!<br>
But it looks like things didn't quiiite go as planned.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akatsuki：</span><br>
Bell, do you think this will really help me?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bell：</span><br>
Umm, maybe?<br>
<br>
The two ninja-obsessed girls looked at each other, apparently deep in thought.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Golden Darkness：</span><br>
...A simple misunderstanding.<br>
Anyway, I'm leaving...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akatsuki：</span><br>
Wait a second! Bell, I saw how Miss Yami here moved, and I have a feeling that she may be...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bell：</span><br>
Do you think we should ask her to teach us?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akatsuki：</span><br>
Yes, yes, of course!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Golden Darkness：</span><br>
...I can hear you.<br>
But my powers aren't something meant to be taught.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akatsuki：</span><br>
I see... Oh! I-in that case...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bell：</span><br>
Here's an idea! Let's play a game!<br>
If we win, you have to teach us ninjutsu!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Golden Darkness：</span><br>
...<br>
<br>
Golden Darkness couldn't bear to tell them no, so she gave up and accepted their proposal.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Golden Darkness：</span><br>
...Incidentally, what is this "ninjutsu" stuff you keep talking about?<br>
Also... Where can I buy taiyaki?<br>

Hmhmhm♪ What fun awaits today~<br>
<br>
Momo hummed a tune as she strolled on.<br>
She wandered about with no particular destination until she sensed something... and found a door hidden in a corner.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Momo Belia Deviluke：</span><br>
Oh? Why is there a door here, of all places...?<br>
<br>
While she wondered if she should knock, a sudden gust of wind blew it open. It hadn't even been locked.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Momo Belia Deviluke：</span><br>
Hmm. Well, I guess that means I can go in. I don't know who this place belongs to, but pardon my intrusion!<br>
<br>
Holding her hands innocently behind her back, she slipped into the building.<br>
The room was full of various different items, each of them lovingly labeled.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Momo Belia Deviluke：</span><br>
"Cup used by the Commander," "pen touched by the Commander"...<br>
Wow... What deeply concerning love you have♪<br>
<br>
While Momo admired the collection, she heard a gasp behind her.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Taihou：</span><br>
Huh?!<br>
How did you find my collection?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Momo Belia Deviluke：</span><br>
Oh, I'm sorry. I was on a stroll, and I just happened upon it.<br>
The wind blew the door open, so I got curious. Especially because it looked like simple storage from the outside.<br>
So this is your private collection? I'm sorry for barging in.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Taihou：</span><br>
...It really wasn't intentional?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Momo Belia Deviluke：</span><br>
Of course not. But my, you seem to have such affection for the Commander.<br>
Tell me more, please? I'm fascinated.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Taihou：</span><br>
Deep affection... That's one way of putting it.<br>
Everything here is a carefully curated collection of things related to the Commander, all gathered by yours truly... Heehee.<br>
That's right. The Commander is mine, all mine...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
I can hardly let a statement like that pass.<br>
No wonder I had such a bad feeling this morning. I never knew you'd put together such a collection, Taihou.<br>
Humph! When it comes to loving the Commander, I fall short of nobody!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Taihou：</span><br>
How did you find this place, too?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Roon：</span><br>
Heehee... I was looking for a change of scenery, and I noticed something fishy around here...<br>
I followed the scent, and here I arrived~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Hmph. As for me, I noticed Roon was acting strange, so I followed her to find out what was going on.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Taihou：</span><br>
Those are hardly good excuses...<br>
<br>
Taihou's rebuttal prompted a stand-off between the shipgirls. There was an uncomfortable silence.<br>
It was then that Akagi noticed Momo, who'd simply waited and watched events unfold.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Momo? If you're here... does that mean you love the Commander, too?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Roon：</span><br>
Heehee, how fun~ So I have another rival on my hands...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Taihou：</span><br>
Wait a second. Are you trying to use my collection to know the Commander better? To outflank me?!<br>
Dastards!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Momo Belia Deviluke：</span><br>
This is getting silly. I'm just very interested in all of your heartfelt affection for the Commander.<br>
My own feelings regarding the Commander are nothing in the face of yours.<br>
But I do understand how you feel. After all, your leader is such a wonderful person.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
...You understand, hmm? Those are cheap words.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Momo Belia Deviluke：</span><br>
It's only natural for someone to want to know everything about the person they love.<br>
To be by their side at all times. To be the apple of their eye.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Taihou：</span><br>
But when the Commander is with me...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Momo Belia Deviluke：</span><br>
You all may still struggle with how to handle these feelings.<br>
Fate brought us all together. May I give you some advice on love? I happen to know a few things.<br>
If you want to win someone's heart, it's important to be able to adapt your charms to their preferences...<br>
For example... If I were you, Akagi, I might do this.<br>
<br>
Momo whispered something into her ear.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
That makes sense...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Momo Belia Deviluke：</span><br>
And as for you, Roon...<br>
<br>
With a smirk on her face, she sidled over to Roon and whispered something else.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Roon：</span><br>
Ooh... That might be worth trying, after all...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Momo Belia Deviluke：</span><br>
And Taihou...<br>
<br>
After a moment's thought, she finally shared another tip with Taihou.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Taihou：</span><br>
W-wait, sh-should I really be doing that?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Momo Belia Deviluke：</span><br>
Yes. I'm sure the Commander will love it.<br>
I know! While we're at it, why don't we plan something even bigger?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akagi：</span><br>
Even bigger? Such as...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Momo Belia Deviluke：</span><br>
I know a way that you can get everything you want from the Commander.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Roon：</span><br>
Hmm? Everything we want?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Taihou：</span><br>
Is it safe to get my hopes up...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Momo Belia Deviluke：</span><br>
Absolutely. Just you wait, girls.<br>
(Heheh... This ought to make things interesting.)<br>
