<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Wilhelm Heidkamp (Z21)：</span><br>
Why did our mission have to be in a place like this?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z18：</span><br>
C'mon, Z21, give us a smile~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hermann Künne (Z19)：</span><br>
We're in a blizzard...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z2：</span><br>
No complaining, Z21. This is the target location, and you're our flagship. Please go over the mission again.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Wilhelm Heidkamp (Z21)：</span><br>
I'm so cold... Can't you do it...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z2：</span><br>
*Sigh*, this battle is one phase of Operation Weserübung. Our objective is to occupy Narvik.<br>
For this operation, Z21 serves as flagship, leading Z2, Z9, Z11, Z12, Z17, Z13, Z18, Z19, and Z22, for a combined strength of ten destroyers.<br>
Any questions?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hermann Künne (Z19)：</span><br>
I have one! Can you tell us about the enemy, Z2?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z2：</span><br>
Narvik has remained neutral, and as such has limited defensive strength. We should have no problem overpowering them.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Wilhelm Heidkamp (Z21)：</span><br>
So we're in for an easy mission?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z2：</span><br>
Taking the port won't be a problem, but after that... Well, let's take this one step at a time.<br>
However, Z18, our intelligence reports there is a fort on the other side of the fjord. You and Z22 should investigate, just in case.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z18：</span><br>
kay~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z2：</span><br>
The rest of you, sortie with Z21.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Wilhelm Heidkamp (Z21)：</span><br>
*Sigh*. That's all of it. Why couldn't Z2 just be the flagship?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z2：</span><br>
Don't be ridiculous.<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z18：</span><br>
I'm back!<br>
Phew, I'm beat. There's nothing on that side of the fjord though...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z2：</span><br>
Intel was wrong...? Thanks anyway.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hermann Künne (Z19)：</span><br>
Z2, we're finished digging in here.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z2：</span><br>
Good. Well done.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z18：</span><br>
Z2's icy as ever. You'd think she'd be happier about completing the mission.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z2：</span><br>
I'm not Z1. And anyway this is no time to relax.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Wilhelm Heidkamp (Z21)：</span><br>
Why not? We successfully occupied Narvik, didn't we?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z2：</span><br>
Like I said, the hard part comes after. Only one of our two scheduled supply ships arrived. We don't have enough to get us back. Also...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z18：</span><br>
The Royal Navy won't just let us hold on to Narvik.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z2：</span><br>
Right. They want this string of ports, just like us. The Scharnhorst Sisters fought Renown yesterday, and the day before that, Hipper got pushed back by a Royal destroyer.<br>
They're... coming.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Wilhelm Heidkamp (Z21)：</span><br>
Hmph, let them come. We'll show them the might of the Iron Blood destroyers!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z2：</span><br>
Okay, save it for the Royal Navy.<br>
Our supply ship can only resupply two ships at a time. You'll all have to take turns getting resupplied.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z-Class：</span><br>
Aye!<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hunter：</span><br>
The Arctic Circle... a vast expanse of pure white snow...<br>
But I can't say I wouldn't like to take a hunting trip across the endless ice fields.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hardy：</span><br>
What are you talking about, Hunter? We're on a mission. We have no time for you to go playing with polar bears.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hunter：</span><br>
Calm down, Hardy. I'm well aware...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hardy：</span><br>
Oh... Sorry. I'm just a bit nervous thinking about the H-class going into battle together.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hunter：</span><br>
Yes, Hardy, you're always so high-strung.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hardy：</span><br>
Yes, but! I think it's important to keep your nerves nice and focused in battle!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hunter：</span><br>
Sure...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hardy：</span><br>
Ahem, anyway, Havock, Hostile, and Hotspur are in position. I'll go over our objectives one more time.<br>
Intelligence reports that the Iron Blood have beaten us to Narvik. Our mission is to penetrate into the harbour and ascertain the enemy's positioning, while making the best strike against them that we can.<br>
As you all know, Glowworm encountered Admiral Hipper the day before yesterday, discovering the enemy fleet bound for Narvik. And we, together with Renown, did battle with the Scharnhorst Sisters near Narvik just yesterday... This may be a very challenging mission<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hunter：</span><br>
It won't be. Glowworm inflicted heavy damage upon Admiral Hipper. And the Scharnhorst Sisters were not bound for Narvik after our battle.<br>
Iron Blood has few capital ships. They probably wouldn't commit their full strength to this...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hardy：</span><br>
You mean we're up against destroyers?<br>
Yes, indeed... Glowworm encountered two Iron Blood destroyers before engaging Admiral Hipper. I'm afraid we will face them too. Thank you, Hunter, your analysis has put me at ease!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hunter：</span><br>
A hunter must understand her prey... And, I cannot be certain.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hardy：</span><br>
No matter. This inductive reasoning is quite enough.<br>
Now then. During the battle with Admiral Hipper, Glowworm bought the enemy retreat at a heavy cost to herself.<br>
I hope every one of you will act as she did. Exhibit the Royal Navy's tradition of bravery, no matter what you may face, do not shrink from the challenge.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hunter：</span><br>
Glowworm... may not have put that much thought into it...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hardy：</span><br>
But is her sacrifice not worthy of our respect?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hunter：</span><br>
Right. I will thank her when we get back home.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hardy：</span><br>
Right then. Pack away that dispirited look of yours, Hunter.<br>
Dead ahead lies Ofotfjord. The Iron Blood know we're coming, and they'll be ready.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hunter：</span><br>
Okay.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hardy：</span><br>
That's more like it. Now make for Narvik before first light. H-class, move out!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">H-Class Ships：</span><br>
Aye!<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hardy：</span><br>
It's a good job we've got this heavy snow. Lets us slip right by the enemy's patrol destroyers.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hunter：</span><br>
Yes. Lucky.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hardy：</span><br>
Right, But... with guards this close, it seems Iron Blood really has taken Narvik... Damn.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hunter：</span><br>
Relax. Soften them up with a coastal bombardment and we should be good.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hardy：</span><br>
You know, Hunter, you always say I'm easily riled, but every now and then you say some pretty excitable things yourself.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hunter：</span><br>
Patience and perseverance are critical to the hunt.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hardy：</span><br>
I-Is that right...?<br>
Well then, we've successfully evaded the enemy patrols and made it into the fjord. Now that we have the initiative, let's gather some intelligence.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">？？？：</span><br>
Hey, Z2, is that you? Weren't me and Z18 getting resupplied next?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hunter：</span><br>
?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hardy：</span><br>
We're out of options. It's time to strike!<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=Contact|选项=5|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Hermann Künne (Z19)：</span><br>
How did you get in here?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hardy：</span><br>
That would be a question for your patrols!<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Hermann Künne (Z19)：</span><br>
Halt!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hunter：</span><br>
Hardy, the snow limits visibility. We should seize the chance.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hardy：</span><br>
Now!<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Hermann Künne (Z19)：</span><br>
Gah, I can't see anything in this snow!<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Z18：</span><br>
We're in trouble. We don't have enough supplies, and the enemy came at us too fast. We're totally unprepared...<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Hermann Künne (Z19)：</span><br>
Come, Z18, let's get after them!<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Z18：</span><br>
Slow down, Z19.<br>
If the enemy wants to hide in this snow, when we're undersupplied, we definitely won't catch them.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Hermann Künne (Z19)：</span><br>
But if the Royal Navy is here, they must be planning to attack the port!<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Z18：</span><br>
Then we should go to the port, shouldn't we?<br>
We gotta warn Z21 and Z2. They have to prepare, and Z2 needs to bring help.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Hermann Künne (Z19)：</span><br>
You're right.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Z18：</span><br>
Phew... but it's gonna be really hard for us to get back to fighting strength.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Hermann Künne (Z19)：</span><br>
Hmph, if the Royal Navy hadn't gotten the drop on us——<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Z18：</span><br>
Ahahaha, there's no way they could know our supply situation. We just got unlucky.<br>
But we can still help out. Leave the fighting to Z21, and we'll protect the supply ship. Otherwise everybody will have trouble getting home.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Hermann Künne (Z19)：</span><br>
Okay, yeah.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Z18：</span><br>
Now that's enough of those eyebrows. Gimme a smile~<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hunter：</span><br>
Through the heavy snow, I can only make out a faint glow on the coast...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hardy：</span><br>
We've already broken through their first line of defense. Narvik Port is dead ahead.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hunter：</span><br>
Say, Hardy, you know what?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hardy：</span><br>
What?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hunter：</span><br>
Narvik...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hardy：</span><br>
Don't tell me you have some critical intelligence?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hunter：</span><br>
I've heard you can see the aurora from here between January and March.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hardy：</span><br>
What?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hunter：</span><br>
Too bad it's already April. We missed it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hardy：</span><br>
Hunter... the enemy is right in front of us.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hunter：</span><br>
Only a thought. Do you really have no interest in the aurora?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hardy：</span><br>
Well, I... I don't know. I've never seen it. Have you?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hunter：</span><br>
I haven't. But I've heard it's beautiful, enchanting even. When I heard we were going to the Arctic, I'd gotten my hopes up.<br>
But seeing so much snow is also nice. It never snows like this back home.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hardy：</span><br>
Really? I think it just gets in the way.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hunter：</span><br>
It does get in the way of battle. But otherwise, it's quite lovely.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hardy：</span><br>
I don't follow.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hunter：</span><br>
I am Hunter, and as such I attach special significance to my natural environment.<br>
Say, Hardy, how would you like to enjoy the snow with me after this mission?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hardy：</span><br>
Now's not the time to think about such things. We are here to attack Narvik. Afterwards...<br>
And afterwards I don't expect to have much time to dawdle either. There will be another mission waiting for us.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hunter：</span><br>
Just for a bit?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hardy：</span><br>
We'll talk again when the mission's done.<br>

<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Wilhelm Heidkamp (Z21)：</span><br>
We have to protect the supply ship. No wandering off. Z2 and the girls went out on patrol and we don't know when they'll be back...<br>
Aren't Z18 and Z19 back yet...? They better hurry up...<br>
Oh, speak of the devil. There's a transmission from Z18... Heh heh. She must want to go play with me too! Let's see here...<br>
The Royal Navy has infiltrated the fjord. They are currently steaming toward Narvik... Um...<br>
WhatdoIdo?! WhatdoIdo?! WhatdoIdo?! Z2 will still need time to get back here even after I call her... Looks like it's all up to me!<br>
...Oh they're already right here!<br>

<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Wilhelm Heidkamp (Z21)：</span><br>
Gah. Just you wait. Z2 and the girls will come get me!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hunter：</span><br>
She fainted...<br>
A little tricker than the other two.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hardy：</span><br>
But still nothing compared to the unified strength of the H-class.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hunter：</span><br>
So... what now?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hardy：</span><br>
What's the situation on the coast?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hunter：</span><br>
Coastal defenses are in position. They will take some time to handle with our firepower alone.<br>
And considering we've already alerted the enemy, reinforcements are certainly inbound.<br>
Should we retreat? We are burning more fuel in this weather than normal.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hardy：</span><br>
No. If we can't occupy Narvik, we must at least evaluate the scale of the enemy defenses.<br>
And we'll have to make some trouble for the Iron Bloods. Those cargo ships over there should do the trick.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hunter：</span><br>
But... that's risky.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hardy：</span><br>
I know. So you all head back. I can take care of it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hunter：</span><br>
Dunce.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hardy：</span><br>
Ouch. Don't suddenly whop me with a torpedo!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hunter：</span><br>
We're a team... And five guns are better than one.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hardy：</span><br>
Very well. Thank you.<br>
Now then, let's cause as much destruction as possible!<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=Evacuation Mission|选项=9|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hunter：</span><br>
Hardy, I just received an emergency report. Enemy reinforcements sighted.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hardy：</span><br>
Already...? That was fast. How many?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hunter：</span><br>
It's too hard to tell with the heavy snow. Radar isn't working either. But at least we know there are a lot more of them than us.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hardy：</span><br>
As much as I'd like to keep bruising the enemy, I think this is as much as we can do——<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hunter：</span><br>
Right. It's best if we can make a smooth retreat.<br>
They must have already figured out our target, and moved to intercept us.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hardy：</span><br>
I think that was clear from the beginning?<br>
At this point, Hunter, no matter what you may fear, we will pull through.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hunter：</span><br>
Right then... Shall we?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hardy：</span><br>
Yes. Start withdrawing.<br>
Say, Hunter...? The snow... is it that lovely...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hunter：</span><br>
It is. When your mind is clear, you'll find... it's truly gorgeous.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hardy：</span><br>
Oh? I never saw anything like it back home...<br>
I'm looking forward to it. That snow you promised me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hunter：</span><br>
Yes. It's a date.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hardy：</span><br>
It is! Let's be off then!<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hunter：</span><br>
Sure enough, they caught us in the end...<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Z2：</span><br>
Sure enough? Aren't you a bold bunch?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hunter：</span><br>
Not bold enough. We didn't bag the big one.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Z2：</span><br>
Take care not to be too bold, or you just might find yourself eaten by your would-be prey.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hunter：</span><br>
You never know if you don't try...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hardy：</span><br>
Indeed. We still don't know if you can beat us now, do we?!<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Z2：</span><br>
Well then, let's find out.<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hardy：</span><br>
It's over!<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Z2：</span><br>
Too bad.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hunter：</span><br>
Hardy!<br>
Ahhhh!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hardy：</span><br>
Hunter!!<br>
Damn... Is that their reinforcements?! F-Fall back——<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Z2：</span><br>
Phew. Truly worthy opponents. Without reinforcements, we would have been in serious trouble...<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Hermann Künne (Z19)：</span><br>
Aren't we chasing them, Z2?<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Z2：</span><br>
The ones just coming back from outside the fjord are going to need to resupply. Not to mention us, after that battle.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Z18：</span><br>
Sorry. It's all my fault...<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Z2：</span><br>
It's not, Z18. You made the right decision. Saving your strength was worth more than foolish bravery.<br>
They escaped, and now they know our strength.<br>
Barring a miracle, the enemy's second attack will be coming. We need to head back and prepare.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Hermann Künne (Z19)：</span><br>
But...<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Z18：</span><br>
Z19, listen to Z2. Let's go take care of Z21.<br>
<span style="color:#ec5d53;">Hermann Künne (Z19)：</span><br>
Um... Okay. But they won't get away next time!<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hunter：</span><br>
...Where am I?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hardy：</span><br>
Thank goodness, Hunter, you're finally awake!<br>
We're on a beach outside Ofotfjord. I burned all my fuel dragging you here.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hunter：</span><br>
Oh.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hardy：</span><br>
Sorry, Hunter. I wasn't careful enough. You got hurt so badly trying to protect me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hunter：</span><br>
It's fine.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hardy：</span><br>
I've sent a distress signal to the rear. They're on their way to rescue us, so...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hunter：</span><br>
Hardy...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hardy：</span><br>
Wh-What?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hunter：</span><br>
The snow.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hardy：</span><br>
The snow...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hunter：</span><br>
Isn't it... pretty?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hardy：</span><br>
I-I'm not sure, but... it's like a white void. Totally empty. It looks... serene.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hunter：</span><br>
Doesn't it? If we get a chance sometime, let's get everyone to come here and see the aurora, eh?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hardy：</span><br>
Yes. It's a date.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hunter：</span><br>
Then... could I take a quick nap?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hardy：</span><br>
Yes. I'll watch over you. Sleep well.<br>
