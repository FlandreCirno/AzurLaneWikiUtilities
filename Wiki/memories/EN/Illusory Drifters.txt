V?rt??l Tower<br>
??? - ??th Fl??r<br>
??? Foy?r<br>
BANG! CLANG!<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">？？？：</span><br>
...Quick to fight. Same as ever.<br>
That's the first rule of the battlefield, no?<br>
...I've never heard of there being any rules in battle.<br>
Indeed. Let that hold you back, and you'll end up beaten into the dirt!<br>
Life or death...<br>
<br>
BANG! CLANG!<br>
Metal shrieked nonstop in the dark as two black-clad girls fiercely clashed, swinging their enormous weapons.<br>
The walls shattered with each strike, sending debris flying and dust swirling through the air.<br>
An empty area spread around the combatants, the result of their intense duel.<br>
CLANG!<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">？？？：</span><br>
Haha, what's the matter? Surely you're not out of breath already.<br>
...<br>
Aww. Don't even have the energy to speak?<br>
...<br>
You've noticed it, haven't you?<br>
...Aha. So you're not fighting me in your sleep.<br>
<br>
Suddenly, the tense air between them vanished as they whipped around and stood back to back, pointing their blades toward the surrounding shadows.<br>
.........<br>
A beastly growl shook the floor from within the dark.<br>
At the same time, countless alien beings emerged from the black and encircled them.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">？？？：</span><br>
What an interesting audience we have. Friends of yours?<br>
I don't sense an urge to kill... but their hostility is clear.<br>
God, you're always so boring! But I guess I knew that already.<br>
Something is strange... Are they really our enemy?<br>
Well, yes, of course. Look at them!<br>
Maybe it'd be easier for us if we just let them do their thing... in a way.<br>
...Not interested.<br>
<br>
The girls continued their conversation, unbothered by the monsters approaching them.<br>
All at once, the beasts unleashed a merciless assault on them...<br>
But in the next instant, the girls' blades rushed forth and cut them all down in one fell swoop.<br>
BANG! CLANG!<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">？？？：</span><br>
Say we resume what's left after we've finished these things off. Deal?<br>
If I must. Anything else would be a waste of time, so I'm forced to help you.<br>
<br>
With that brief exchange, they shot like bullets in opposite directions and charged into the enemy horde.<br>
BWOOOOM!<br>
After a short pause, there was a blinding flash immediately followed by the earsplitting sound of destruction.<br>
Port - Radar Station<br>
BEEP BEEP BEEP!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
Red alert! All departments, be on guard! Anomaly detected!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB ：</span><br>
Confirming.<br>
Special alert confirmed. Identifying... Surveillance target activated.<br>
Target identified as Virtual Tower.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Constellation：</span><br>
Virtual Tower? As in... the Siren facility that appeared out of nowhere a while back?<br>
It remained there even after the Mirror Sea was lifted.<br>
Did someone activate that dormant facility...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
We have to contact the Commander!<br>
<br>
*knock knock*<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I heard the alarm. What's going on?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Good timing – we were just about to report to you. This is what we know so far...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Who knew we'd see the day that the Virtual Tower would do something?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB ：</span><br>
Intelligence report: abnormal data observed in the waters near the target. The Virtual Tower is likely rebuilding the Mirror Sea. Monitoring devices are confirmed to be going offline one after another.<br>
Before going offline, the monitors detected shockwaves from a suspected explosion in the area, but nothing of the sort has been visually confirmed.<br>
Hypothesis: A weapons experiment may be taking place within.<br>
Proposition: Form a fleet to investigate the target at once.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Agreed. Something is going on in there, and we can't stand idly by while it poses a threat.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB ：</span><br>
It would be advisable to dispatch combat personnel, as hostiles may block the way to the tower.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I'm not surprised. Meanwhile... If the anomaly is inside the tower, then our recon team will probably need to go inside, right?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB ：</span><br>
Yes. Through previous investigations, we have some grasp of its internal structure.<br>
Calculating optimal operational plan. Estimated completion time: one hour and forty minutes.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Let's use that time to assemble the fleet. We need to get moving.<br>
Helena, keep monitoring the situation for me. TB, keep in touch throughout the operation so that we can respond to any unexpected developments ASAP.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB ：</span><br>
Orders received.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
I'll gather combat and search personnel.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Okay. Everyone meets at the dock in two hours. Be sure to check your communications and equipment by then.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Everyone：</span><br>
Roger!<br>

V?rt??l Tower<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Purity：</span><br>
Hm...?<br>
What the heck is going on?<br>
I'm supposed to be in the interstellar data stream...<br>
So why am I here?<br>
...Clones? Data backups? Mass-produced vessels?<br>
What's with all these fragments of data?<br>
Where am I? Why is my data here?<br>
Weird...<br>
Meh. It must be some kind of wacky bug, that's all.<br>
Let me just reboot it and see what happens.<br>

<br>
V?rt??l Tower<br>
??? - ??th Fl??r<br>
??? Foy?r<br>
BANG! CLANG!<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">？？？：</span><br>
Tch... This is going nowhere.<br>
Oh? Giving up already? Is that really all you've got?<br>
You haven't changed one bit.<br>
...Going through this over and over doesn't mean I'll start enjoying it.<br>
That makes sense.<br>
But...<br>
<br>
BANG! CLANG!<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">？？？：</span><br>
Would it kill you to at least tell me how many of them are left?!<br>
<br>
Meanwhile, in the entrance hall of the same tower...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kearsarge：</span><br>
Checking all members' vitals... All clear.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Oleg：</span><br>
All instruments are in working order. I've already begun data collection.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB ：</span><br>
Communications remain stable. No errors or loss detected in audio or data transmission.<br>
The data protection barrier is operating properly, and radar and sensor values are being analyzed.<br>
Question: Do you feel any physical discomfort?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Neptune：</span><br>
Not particularly. You told us earlier it would be like going into a VR game, right?<br>
But this feels so much more realistic than I'd imagined.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Impero：</span><br>
Same... I'm getting a little sleepy in here. If only this place had a bathtub. TB, can you make one?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB ：</span><br>
Apologies. I do not have control over the Virtual Tower, so it is impossible for me to create objects.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Impero：</span><br>
Ah, shame.<br>
Maybe I can sleep leaning on a wall...?<br>
<br>
Impero reaches out to touch a wall, and the patterns on the walls and floor suddenly start to shift.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kearsarge：</span><br>
Be careful!<br>
<br>
Kearsarge quickly pulls her away from the wall, but the change does not end.<br>
The strange lines spread wildly like a virus, eerie and unnatural.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Impero：</span><br>
Hmm? What is this...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Neptune：</span><br>
It looks like a creepy computer virus... Do you feel okay?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Impero：</span><br>
Yeah, I'm fine.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB ：</span><br>
No issues detected in the data barrier. Likewise, no contamination detected in Impero.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Neptune：</span><br>
Phew... I'm glad it doesn't seem to affect us at all.<br>
Now we can explore with peace of mind.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kearsarge：</span><br>
First things first, let's check out the source of that suspected explosion.<br>
<br>
Some time later, the search team led by Kearsarge was still making its way through the complex passages of the tower.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kearsarge：</span><br>
This is all we have. We've reached the end of what was mapped in previous expeditions.<br>
TB, all the passages and nodes leading to other areas along the way were still dormant.<br>
The shifting patterns from before don't seem to have activated these mysterious blocks, either.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB ：</span><br>
The data barrier holds. We still lack information, so I suggest continuing forward to investigate further.<br>
I've marked points on the map that may lead to the upper floor.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Impero：</span><br>
Roger that. Then let's get...<br>
<br>
KABOOOOM!<br>
With a sudden blast, a wall up ahead shattered. Amidst the dust, a girl in black rolled out from the breach.<br>
Another one, dressed in the same color and wielding a large scythe, landed on her feet next to her.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kearsarge：</span><br>
Who goes there?!<br>
<br>
The girls likewise noticed the search team's presence, looked at them, and sighed.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">？？？：</span><br>
...Unlucky.<br>
Don't sell us short. Have we ever been lucky, even once?<br>
I'd think that the very fact that we're here is unlucky enough on its own.<br>
...True.<br>
<br>
KABOOOOM!<br>
While they spoke only to each other, more holes were blown out of the wall. Lights flickered behind the openings.<br>
The alien beings clambered through one after the other.<br>
They resembled ordinary Sirens at first glance, but with an added element of uncanniness.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Oleg：</span><br>
Oh, oooh... It's like a rare Siren expo! Ah, how fascinating!<br>
Can these Sirens be moved out of the Virtual Tower?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kearsarge：</span><br>
We won't know until we try.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Neptune：</span><br>
Put that idea to rest at once! Right now, we focus on neutralizing them.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Oleg：</span><br>
Fine, fine. I can still get data mid-fight! Fine by me!<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">？？？：</span><br>
...You see those as enemies, then?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Neptune：</span><br>
Obviously! At least we can communicate with you, unlike those Sirens.<br>
Let's join together for now and clean up those monsters. Sound good?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">？？？：</span><br>
I have no objections.<br>
...Okay.<br>
<br>
Again, their weapons danced and whirled, this time accompanied by the booming of artillery.<br>
V?rt??l Tower<br>
??? - ??th Fl??r<br>
??? M?t?ix<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Purity：</span><br>
Uhh...<br>
It should've restarted by now, right?<br>
Why am I still here?<br>
This is dumb. Guess I gotta self-destruct at this point.<br>
Enough of these stupid fragments trapped in this stupid place...<br>
Time to blow it all away!<br>

<br>
V?rt??l Tower<br>
??? - ??th Fl??r<br>
??? Foy?r<br>
BANG! CLANG!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">？？？：</span><br>
...Next.<br>
My, my... Settling this with fisticuffs after all? How utterly barbaric.<br>
...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Impero：</span><br>
The brilliant Impero won't be outdone. Go, my bombers.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Neptune：</span><br>
Those two have almost cleared our port side. Focus on starboard!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kearsarge：</span><br>
Suppress them with a barrage! Don't let the enemy behind us!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Oleg：</span><br>
Heeey, that one's the last one! Everyone, be gentle! Leave just one clean corpse for me, pleeease!<br>
<br>
KABOOOOM!<br>
When the smoke cleared, the strange Sirens were all gone.<br>
Meanwhile, the two girls stopped simultaneously but stayed on guard, watching the search team warily.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kearsarge：</span><br>
I'm Kearsarge. These girls are Neptune, Impero, and Oleg. We fight together.<br>
We shipgirls have always been battling the Sirens – the same kind of enemies we just took down.<br>
Since you two were just fighting them as well, I think there's no reason for us to fight each other.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Neptune：</span><br>
What do you think? Can you tell us your names?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">BLACK★ROCK SHOOTER：</span><br>
...If that's what you want.<br>
I am... BLACK★ROCK SHOOTER.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">DEAD MASTER：</span><br>
DEAD MASTER. It's up to you whether you'll be able to remember this, though.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kearsarge：</span><br>
Let's see. TB, is there any record of those names in our database?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB ：</span><br>
Negative. No such records exist.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Neptune：</span><br>
...In that case, I think we have more visitors on our hands.<br>
So, how did the two of you end up here?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">BLACK★ROCK SHOOTER：</span><br>
...I don't know.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">DEAD MASTER：</span><br>
One moment I was fighting BLACK★ROCK SHOOTER, and the next, we were here... That's basically it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Impero：</span><br>
Among all of our visitors, you're the... calmest, by far. Impressive.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">BLACK★ROCK SHOOTER：</span><br>
...We're used to this.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">DEAD MASTER：</span><br>
Happens all the time.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Neptune：</span><br>
O-oh, I see... Well, I still have an important question for you.<br>
Do you two exist? Or are you simple data like we are now?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kearsarge：</span><br>
Maybe we owe them an explanation before we ask existential questions.<br>
So, as you can see, this is a very special place.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">DEAD MASTER：</span><br>
Hmm... Okay, so what is that supposed to mean for me, exactly?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">BLACK★ROCK SHOOTER：</span><br>
...I can move freely, run, and swing my blade. Nothing else matters.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kearsarge：</span><br>
I'm relieved to hear that it doesn't bother you. We'd like to formally request your help in tackling the ongoing issues within this tower.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">DEAD MASTER：</span><br>
Oh, that won't do. We have a little fight to get back to.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Impero：</span><br>
Um... Why? I'm not seeing the point?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">BLACK★ROCK SHOOTER：</span><br>
...I thought you would say that.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">DEAD MASTER：</span><br>
Let's go somewhere else and continue. Or do you want these poor girls involved?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">BLACK★ROCK SHOOTER：</span><br>
...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kearsarge：</span><br>
Please hold on! I have an idea.<br>
Like I said before, we have a common enemy. We don't have to work together, but our port would like to lend you our aid.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">DEAD MASTER：</span><br>
Hmm? Tell me more.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB ：</span><br>
Greetings, Miss BLACK★ROCK SHOOTER and Miss DEAD MASTER. I am Navigator TB.<br>
My role is to provide technical support to the search team throughout this operation.<br>
I've recorded information regarding you and, upon the Commander's suggestion, I have prepared riggings to help you better adapt to the Virtual Tower's environment.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">BLACK★ROCK SHOOTER：</span><br>
Rigging? Is that the equipment they were using?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB ：</span><br>
Yes. Sending data packets.<br>
<br>
When the blue light of the data stream faded, a few noticeable changes appeared around the two girls.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">BLACK★ROCK SHOOTER：</span><br>
...It feels like part of me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">DEAD MASTER：</span><br>
Oooh. This rigging is ever so convenient.<br>
It reacts like it's part of my body. Fascinating. How does that work?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Neptune：</span><br>
From our perspective, it's more fascinating how you swing such powerful weapons with those tiny, fleshy bodies of yours...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB ：</span><br>
Power to the elevator has been restored. Please stand by until it's been charged.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Oleg：</span><br>
There you have it. Let's get going!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">DEAD MASTER：</span><br>
I'll have to pass on using such an unreliable machine. I can handle myself – have fun.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Impero：</span><br>
Huh? Why? Going rogue isn't going to keep you safe...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">DEAD MASTER：</span><br>
Look, you all are fine, but I'm not about to play at friendship with this girl.<br>
Remember, she and I are eternal enemies. Always have been, always will be.<br>
<br>
It was as if DEAD MASTER's menacing words shattered the very walls. They suddenly collapsed, unleashing a fresh horde of Sirens, even more twisted and grotesque than the last.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kearsarge：</span><br>
We didn't even notice them until they were right next to us? This block construction surrounded by so many walls is going to be a nuisance.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">DEAD MASTER：</span><br>
Well, I'll be taking my leave.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Neptune：</span><br>
Hey! Don't run around alone, please!<br>
<br>
Ignoring the stunned search team, DEAD MASTER took her weapon in hand and plunged into the enemy horde in the blink of an eye.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB ：</span><br>
Elevator charged. Please continue to stand by until the area around you is locked down.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Oleg：</span><br>
Wait, we're locked in here?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Impero：</span><br>
Ugh... What on earth is she thinking?<br>
Even if she survives, who knows when we'll see her again?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">BLACK★ROCK SHOOTER：</span><br>
...Don't worry. If I'm with you, she'll be back.<br>
That's how we are.<br>
There's no need to wait. Let's go.<br>
<br>
V?rt??l Tower<br>
??? - ??th Fl??r<br>
??? M?t?ix<br>
Amidst the crumbling wreckage, Purity opened her eyes once again.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Purity：</span><br>
.........<br>
Okay, how long is this gonna keep going on?<br>
Ugh... Forget it.<br>
I don't see any way out of here right now... Might as well explore a bit, or something.<br>

<br>
V?rt??l Tower<br>
??? - ??th Fl??r<br>
??? P?s??ge<br>
Despite a jarringly long wait, the elevator finally stopped.<br>
The light enveloping the elevator faded, and the group stepped out onto a new floor.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB ：</span><br>
Please be careful. The area ahead is unexplored ground.<br>
Proceed with caution, and map the area as you go.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kearsarge：</span><br>
Understood. We'll be careful.<br>
<br>
KABOOOOM!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Oleg：</span><br>
Hmm? That was an explosion, wasn't it?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">BLACK★ROCK SHOOTER：</span><br>
...There's a battle up ahead.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Impero：</span><br>
Could it be... DEAD MASTER? Did she get here before us somehow?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kearsarge：</span><br>
Let's go support her.<br>
<br>
The wall on the other end of the passage collapsed from artillery fire. As twisted monsters poured through the breach, one figure stood out among them: a distorted humanoid, controlling some kind of massive equipment.<br>
Strange patterns spread across its body, seemingly corrupted by something alien just like the rest of the tower.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Impero：</span><br>
Purifier? Or Purity...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB ：</span><br>
Analysis: This may be the elite Siren, Purifier.<br>
Hypothesis: The tower's abnormal data may have contaminated her.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Neptune：</span><br>
...Could it be that Purity herself got contaminated?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB ：</span><br>
It cannot be ruled out. More performance data is required for more precise speculation.<br>
<br>
The girls' hesitation gave the twisted Purifier time to draw closer, slow but sure.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">BLACK★ROCK SHOOTER：</span><br>
...Here it comes!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kearsarge：</span><br>
Can't be helped. Fight first, figure out the rest later!<br>
<br>
<br>
KABOOOOM!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kearsarge：</span><br>
Stronger than expected... That patterned shell makes it incredibly tough to crack.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Impero：</span><br>
I can't find an opening at all. Guess I'll just have to ratchet up the firepower!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">BLACK★ROCK SHOOTER：</span><br>
Stand back, everyone.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB ：</span><br>
Warning: extremely high energy levels detected.<br>
<br>
The instant BLACK★ROCK SHOOTER and TB shouted their warnings, space itself seemed to rupture, and a searing flash of steel streaked past.<br>
The lightning-fast strike cleaved the twisted Purifier in two. Its mangled body collapsed to the ground.<br>
Next to the wreckage was the other girl in black, DEAD MASTER.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Neptune：</span><br>
DEAD MASTER? Thank goodness you're safe...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Impero：</span><br>
You're fast. Thanks for the backup.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">BLACK★ROCK SHOOTER：</span><br>
...Wait.<br>
<br>
BLACK★ROCK SHOOTER's voice interrupted the shipgirls' approach.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">BLACK★ROCK SHOOTER：</span><br>
Look closer. DEAD MASTER and her rigging...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Oleg：</span><br>
Huh?! She has that same messed-up pattern as that Purifier... and her rigging is all weird, too!<br>
Could it be...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">BLACK★ROCK SHOOTER：</span><br>
...<br>
<br>
Without a word, BLACK★ROCK SHOOTER silently raised her sword once more.<br>
As if triggered by this move, DEAD MASTER turned to her, lifting her massive scythe and assuming a battle-ready stance.<br>
Her eyes were lifeless, the hollow sockets holding nothing but void.<br>
Like a bolt of lightning, an attack struck; BLACK★ROCK SHOOTER instantly countered.<br>
Thus, another battle to the death had begun between these two fated rivals...<br>
...Or had it?<br>
A dazzling exchange of strikes flew constantly between them. This time, their all-out duel was backed by fierce artillery fire.<br>
But something was wrong.<br>
For some reason, the shockwaves from their clashes always stopped just short of reaching the search team.<br>
Not so much as a speck of rubble grazed them.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">BLACK★ROCK SHOOTER：</span><br>
...Put an end to this stupid prank.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">DEAD MASTER：</span><br>
...<br>
You already figured me out? Always such a buzzkill.<br>
But I'll have you know that I'm fighting every bit as seriously as ever.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">BLACK★ROCK SHOOTER：</span><br>
Do you know the phrase, "time and place"?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">DEAD MASTER：</span><br>
If I really wanted to put an end to our little contest here and now, I could do it~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">BLACK★ROCK SHOOTER：</span><br>
Now is not the time.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Oleg：</span><br>
Does this mean...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB ：</span><br>
Scanning... Corrosion confirmed, but only at a surface level.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Impero：</span><br>
So she's wearing it like clothes?<br>
That means... her mind is totally intact? She's just like that?<br>
And she attacked us for the hell of it because she had an excuse?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">BLACK★ROCK SHOOTER：</span><br>
Maybe she's a little stressed from fighting so many enemies for so long.<br>
That's why she wants to stretch and have "fun."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Neptune：</span><br>
Umm...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">BLACK★ROCK SHOOTER：</span><br>
Be patient for now.<br>
When this problem is solved, we'll have all the time in the world to fight.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">DEAD MASTER：</span><br>
Okay, okay. I get it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Oleg：</span><br>
Are we done now? Can anyone explain what the deal is between you two?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">DEAD MASTER：</span><br>
Let's go, everyone! No more dilly-dallying!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Oleg：</span><br>
Come ON!<br>
<br>
CLUNK!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Oleg：</span><br>
Hey, did anyone else hear that just now?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Impero：</span><br>
It came from that Purifier vessel's wreckage. No way... Is it coming back to life?!<br>
<br>
From within the scattered debris, Purity's eyes opened anew.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Purity：</span><br>
Uuugh... I didn't think the contamination would be this bad.<br>
I might've gotten a little carried away...<br>
<br>
The search team watched, stunned, and quietly raised their cannons.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Purity：</span><br>
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, WAIT!<br>
DON'T SHOOT! I SURRENDEEER!<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Purity：</span><br>
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, WAIT!<br>
DON'T SHOOT! I SURRENDEEER!<br>
<br>
Everyone's attacks stopped on a dime right before the finishing blow.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Impero：</span><br>
...Come again?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Oleg：</span><br>
Surrender? Wait, you really are Purity?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Purity：</span><br>
That's riiight~☆ I'm basically one of you guys!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kearsarge：</span><br>
I'm only getting more confused. What's going on here?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Purity：</span><br>
Sooo, basicallyyy... It's complicated and simple, at the same time.<br>
To put it briefly...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kearsarge：</span><br>
All I'm hearing is that you don't know, either!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Purity：</span><br>
Yep! That about sums it up!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Impero：</span><br>
Stupid, useless Purity.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Purity：</span><br>
But listen! I know other stuff. You're looking for the source of all this, right?<br>
How convenient! For some reason, some of the map data of this tower's been shared with my vessel here!<br>
That means I can show you straight to the core!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">BLACK★ROCK SHOOTER：</span><br>
Then do it. Now.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">DEAD MASTER：</span><br>
Lead the way, little loser.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Purity：</span><br>
Okie-dokie!<br>
<br>
<br>
V?rt??l Tower<br>
??? - ??th Fl??r<br>
Anomaly's Source<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB ：</span><br>
Scan results analyzed.<br>
Judging from the explosion's traces and the density and distribution of pollutants, this block is the source of the anomaly.<br>
The giant machine there, its interior exposed by the explosion, would be the core of said anomaly.<br>
<br>
The enormous machine TB described as the "core" was originally meant to be a computing node that normally managed the internal environment of the tower.<br>
However, some writhing creature had taken over, continuously outputting errors and alien data.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kearsarge：</span><br>
You can really tell from how strong the hostiles are...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Impero：</span><br>
Are all those things packed in there... contaminated Tester vessels?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB ：</span><br>
Analysis: Except for the corrosive growths attached to the armor, their structures are consistent with those of the mass-produced vessels used by the Sirens.<br>
Henceforth to be referred to as "Viral Junk Sirens."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Neptune：</span><br>
The system was infected by a virus, and the resulting glitch is causing it to generate all these junk Sirens...<br>
The things we saw on the lower floors must have been even shoddier junk Sirens, probably the result of data from all the different floors getting mixed in.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Oleg：</span><br>
What I'm hearing is, we just have to destroy that core machine right there, and all our problems are solved!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Purity：</span><br>
...Easier said than done. How do you mean to destroy that army of Testers?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Oleg：</span><br>
Don't we have you on our side?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Purity：</span><br>
I can't do it!<br>
Like I told you on the way here, this vessel is just a hodgepodge of junk thrown together at random because of some stupid program error!<br>
I can tank a few hits for you, maybe, but if you think I'm soloing all those things, you'll be sorely disappointed!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Impero：</span><br>
Tch...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Purity：</span><br>
I'm tired of you calling me useless! Look, I've got a plan, but I need to talk with your navigator first.<br>
What do you think?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB ：</span><br>
Proposition: Suppress computing power. By using our computing resources to return the corrupted areas to normal, we can greatly reduce both the number of enemies and their overall strength.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Purity：</span><br>
Exactly! This thing's just a crappy little machine, while you've got the resources of the entire port in the palm of your hand. So do something!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB ：</span><br>
Please wait a moment. Issuing request to the Commander.<br>
Request approved. Allocating resources and calculating solutions. Please buy as much time as possible.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">DEAD MASTER：</span><br>
You're saying we need to fight anyway? Then let's get started. Can you still fight?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">BLACK★ROCK SHOOTER：</span><br>
Of course.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kearsarge：</span><br>
Everyone, focus your firepower! Begin by securing a safe zone around us!<br>
<br>
<br>
Seemingly sensing TB's attempt to gather computing resources, the dense swarm of enemies charged frantically toward the team.<br>
The girls' formation shattered under the onslaught, and for a moment, they were each forced to fight alone.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Impero：</span><br>
They're too close... My brilliant brain requires backup to function properly!<br>
<br>
BANG!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">BLACK★ROCK SHOOTER：</span><br>
Are you okay, Impero?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Impero：</span><br>
Phew... Thanks for saving me.<br>
<br>
KABOOOOM!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Impero：</span><br>
This is bad... Be careful, BLACK★ROCK SHOOTER! Don't let them get a clean hit on you!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">BLACK★ROCK SHOOTER：</span><br>
Urgh!<br>
<br>
The moment BLACK★ROCK SHOOTER lost her balance, DEAD MASTER glided in front of her, eliminating the attacking enemy with one swift, decisive blow.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">DEAD MASTER：</span><br>
You're still too careless. Should I hold back next time we fight?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">BLACK★ROCK SHOOTER：</span><br>
...<br>
<br>
<br>
Eventually, good news came from TB.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB ：</span><br>
All preparations are complete. Now implementing computing power suppression. Please stay as far from the enemy as possible.<br>
<br>
A blue data stream appeared out of thin air. Every hostile it touched, along with the abnormal area, was quietly engulfed by it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kearsarge：</span><br>
Perfect! We have a path to the core now. Everyone, prepare for assault!<br>
<br>
Kearsarge summoned everyone to her side to focus their firepower, but Purity stopped them.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Purity：</span><br>
The suppression is working, but it's nowhere near as much as I was hoping.<br>
At this rate, we can't destroy the contaminated core.<br>
If you get too close now, you'll just be swallowed up by the next wave it generates.<br>
Not that I planned to let you all do it in the first place.<br>
Nope, lucky you, I've got more than just data in this vessel – I inherited a few permissions, too!<br>
As long as I can get physical access to that machine, I can send a self-destruct command!<br>
You nerds just watch me save the day!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Impero：</span><br>
But if the core explodes, then what happens to you?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Purity：</span><br>
You know. Bam! Dead as a doornail.<br>
Aw, don't look at me like that. You know I won't ACTUALLY die, right?<br>
My mainframe isn't here. In fact, I've already self-destructed a bunch of times today.<br>
I just hope this time gets me out of this hellhole!<br>
Let's gooooo!<br>
<br>
With that, Purity charged into the interior of the machine.<br>
There was a boom as the computing node burst into glorious flames.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kearsarge：</span><br>
TB, target destruction confirmed.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Oleg：</span><br>
Oooh! She did it! That's another problem solved!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Impero：</span><br>
I'll never forget you, Purity... May you return stronger than ever before.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">DEAD MASTER：</span><br>
Am I hearing them right? Our little problem here is dealt with?<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">BLACK★ROCK SHOOTER：</span><br>
Probably.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">DEAD MASTER：</span><br>
Good. In that case, shall we?<br>
<br>
Both girls jumped away simultaneously and readied their weapons, as if they hadn't just won a life-or-death battle by the skin of their teeth. Their blades dripped with murderous intent.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Oleg：</span><br>
Whaaat?! I seriously don't get why you're... Do you just ALWAYS do this?!<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">DEAD MASTER：</span><br>
Stay out of this if you don't want to get caught in the crossfire.<br>
We don't need a reason. No matter what, things always come to this.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">BLACK★ROCK SHOOTER：</span><br>
No matter what world, no matter what era. We meet, and we fight.<br>
That's the fate placed upon us.<br>
<br>
Even as they talked, the two carefully closed the distance between them. One more step, and they would once again straddle the bounds of life and death...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Impero：</span><br>
Hold on!<br>
<br>
Impero rushed between the two and forced their confrontation to come to a grinding halt.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Impero：</span><br>
Things aren't completely finished yet. We haven't left the Virtual Tower.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">DEAD MASTER：</span><br>
Then why don't you all just go?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Impero：</span><br>
And let you two kill each other?<br>
You should realize by now that this place is nothing like whatever world you came from.<br>
I don't know how things worked for you before, but...<br>
Or do you really think you know what will come of your stupid fight when you don't belong in this world in the first place?<br>
As for me, I'M not gambling my life on unknowns, I'll tell you that much.<br>
<br>
It seemed Impero's words had quelled their fire; both girls silently lowered their weapons.<br>
DEAD MASTER was clearly unhappy with this, but she didn't push the matter any further.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Impero：</span><br>
For now, come back to port with us.<br>
If you still want to fight, then Sardegna will gladly arrange a formal duel for you.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">DEAD MASTER：</span><br>
Sounds like a lot of unnecessary effort to me. What if I say no?<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">BLACK★ROCK SHOOTER：</span><br>
...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Impero：</span><br>
Overruled. TB, get everyone out of here – INCLUDING them.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB ：</span><br>
Understood. Executing recovery program.<br>
<br>
A curtain of blue light descended, enveloping the girls. For a moment, they were rendered immobile.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">DEAD MASTER：</span><br>
Hey, what's going on here?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB ：</span><br>
A necessary purification procedure before your evacuation. It will not harm you, so please remain calm.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">DEAD MASTER：</span><br>
What?! I didn't agree to this!<br>
Say something, damn it!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">BLACK★ROCK SHOOTER：</span><br>
...I don't think anything we can say would matter. We're outsiders. Let's obey for now.<br>
<br>
The light intensified, and the tower began to blur. In its place appeared an expanse of deep-blue water and sky.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">DEAD MASTER：</span><br>
Uuugh! I can't stand this!<br>
<br>
Meanwhile, in the port's command center...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Phew... That settles that matter.<br>
Why do you think those two were in the Virtual Tower to begin with?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB ：</span><br>
At present, there is not enough information to investigate the precise reason.<br>
Unfortunately, I cannot answer your inquiry.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
I was just asking out of curiosity, so don't worry about it. This isn't the first time something like this has happened, anyway.<br>
We already know these people all come with their own unique, if not strange, circumstances.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Constellation：</span><br>
Still, I can't believe they exited the tower so smoothly...<br>
You can't go in there without being made into data in the first place, right?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB ：</span><br>
I cannot answer this question either.<br>
Hypothesis: Some particular trait of the Virtual Tower may be the cause of their appearance and smooth exit.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Either way, they're our guests now.<br>
We should give them a warm welcome.<br>
Let's go and greet them right away.<br>
<br>
Illusory Drifters - END<br>
