1 Neatly, Efficiently<br>
Port - Office<br>
On Richelieu's recommendation, I appointed Clemenceau as my secretary ship.<br>
I couldn't imagine that the puppeteer and cardinal of the Iris would be very used to secretary work, but...<br>
Upon looking at the documents she'd handed me, I realize that I was dead wrong.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Clemenceau：</span><br>
My, Commander, you've been staring down those papers for a while. It makes me wonder if I did something wrong.<br>
If there's anything you don't understand, I'm happy to explain it to you.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
That won't be necessary. Actually, your work is so much better than I expected. I'm just amazed.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Clemenceau：</span><br>
Heehee. I'll take that as a compliment.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Richelieu：</span><br>
I'll have you know that Clemenceau's paperwork skills are even greater than mine.<br>
I'm only able to work through the Iris's countless daily affairs because of her help.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Clemenceau：</span><br>
Please, Cardinal. I'm just a worrisome sister who wants to help you out here and there.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Richelieu：</span><br>
Don't be so humble, Clemenceau. You're an excellent worker, and that's exactly why I recommended you for this position.<br>
Serve the Commander well and bring glory to the name of the Iris.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Clemenceau：</span><br>
Of course. Don't worry about me.<br>
<br>
After a quick check-in with us, Richelieu leaves my office, and Clemenceau returns to her seat to resume her work.<br>
The occasional grins that flash onto her face, the little tunes she hums... They make me wonder.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Clemenceau, is it just me, or are you in a good mood...?)<br>
<br>
*knock* *knock*<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">???：</span><br>
Can I come in, Commander?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Jean Bart?<br>
Come in. What's the matter?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jean Bart：</span><br>
...Uh...<br>
<br>
As soon as she enters the room, Jean Bart makes a weird face. Her body is faced toward me, but her eyes keep drifting over to Clemenceau.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Clemenceau：</span><br>
Oh? Did someone come to visit me?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jean Bart：</span><br>
No! Dunkerque made sweets, so... Richelieu wanted me to bring some over.<br>
When you two break for lunch, have some sweets after your meal.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Richelieu? But she just left the office. Why did she send Jean Bart...?)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Clemenceau：</span><br>
Really, now~ Yes, the Commander and I will enjoy Dunkerque's kindness to our hearts' content.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jean Bart：</span><br>
Yeah, have fun. ...I'm gonna go now.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Jean Bart is acting weird...)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Clemenceau：</span><br>
♪~<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Clemenceau, too.)<br>
(She was the same as usual when we started our morning work...)<br>
(But she's in such a good mood after Richelieu and Jean Bart's little visits.)<br>
(Could it be?)<br>
Did your sisters worrying about you put you in such a good mood?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Clemenceau：</span><br>
Oh, come now. I have no idea what you could possibly mean, Commander.<br>
Mm, don't they smell so appetizing? Commander, have you ever eaten Dunkerque's sweets before?<br>
Hers taste a little lighter than traditional Iris sweets.<br>
One meager taste, and their refreshing elegance lingers in your memory forever.<br>
You might just find yourself bored of sweets that do nothing but heap on sugar!<br>
Heehee, don't you agree, Commander?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(It feels as if she's changed the subject while still somehow answering my question...)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Clemenceau：</span><br>
Ah, yes. Sorry, Commander, but it seems those little interruptions have put us behind on work.<br>
We'll have to work harder if we want to make it in time for lunch!<br>

2 Gently, Minutely<br>
Port - Hallway Outside Office<br>
Due to an urgent meeting today, I arrive at my office a little late.<br>
Clemenceau has been working as my secretary ship for a while now. Her excellent work has been a huge help, to the point that we even leave work early sometimes.<br>
(But I still don't feel comfortable leaving her alone in my office. I hope nothing bad has happened in my absence...)<br>
Port - Office<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dunkerque：</span><br>
Clemenceau, do you think crème brûlée and macarons are a good combination for the party? Or would Mont Blanc and chocolate muffins be better?<br>
Cream cake and mousse cake are a timeless combo, too... Oh, but what about madeleines and chocolate truffles?<br>
Hmm... They're all so delicious that I can't even begin to choose.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Clemenceau：</span><br>
Have you considered picking a pair that matches the drink selection?<br>
Black tea and green tea would demand a sweeter array of pastries...<br>
If it's to go with coffee, then you'd want to base it on the type and recipe of the coffee.<br>
Either way, knowing the number of participants, there are going to be a wide range of preferences. Don't you think you'd be better off preparing multiple combinations?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dunkerque：</span><br>
Yeah... Thank you, Clemenceau. I'll go work on it right away.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">L'Opiniâtre：</span><br>
Lady Clemenceau, what sorts of spells would be best for the party?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Clemenceau：</span><br>
Nothing explosive, please. We don't want to turn the tea party into a fireworks show, now, do we?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">L'Opiniâtre：</span><br>
No explosions, check! Well, as long as nobody touches my props...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Clemenceau：</span><br>
Oh, my... You should ask Akashi if she has anything safer.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vauquelin：</span><br>
I'll help decorate the venue, too! ...Is there anything I can do, though?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">L'Opiniâtre：</span><br>
Just sit there quietly. No pranks.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vauquelin：</span><br>
I won't play any pranks! I really wanna help!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Clemenceau：</span><br>
Hmm. In that case... Help Le Malin and the others prepare drinks, would you?<br>
Don't forget to have cold water for more sensitive tongues like Le Terrible's.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vauquelin：</span><br>
Okay! Oh, should we have wine for Cardinal Richelieu, too?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Clemenceau：</span><br>
Ah, yes... Richelieu may not come given her busy schedule, but having one ready couldn't possibly hurt.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vauquelin：</span><br>
Got it! Leave those drinks to me!<br>
<br>
When I enter my office, I find Clemenceau surrounded by other Iris girls.<br>
Even when the crowd lobs question after question at her, she answers without slowing her paperwork.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："You're scary..."</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2："Very impressive!"</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Clemenceau：</span><br>
Well, if it isn't the Commander. Flatter me all you want, but you'll receive no gifts.<br>
Oh, but outside working hours, we could...<br>
Heehee, I'm kidding. This is trivial, really, so it doesn't affect my secretary ship work.<br>
Besides, it's an honor to get to solve our comrades' cute little worries.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Worries such as...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Clemenceau：</span><br>
I mean preparing for the coming party. Little worries regarding the sweets, drinks, and entertainment... Don't you find it adorable to worry about such things?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Now that you mention it, I guess...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Clemenceau：</span><br>
We have an important joint exercise in just a few days. It would be a problem if people couldn't perform to their potential just because they were troubled by such silly things.<br>
I care quite a bit about whether the Iris can win, you know.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
You're surprisingly competitive when it comes to this stuff...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Clemenceau：</span><br>
Oh, not really. I'm just excited.<br>
Commander, may I trouble you to attend the exercise's opening ceremony with me?<br>

<br>
3 Unexpectedly Competitive<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Clemenceau：</span><br>
The goal of this joint exercise is to improve both the breadth and depth of inter-faction cooperation.<br>
I would like you all to simulate the most realistic battle possible in order to yield data that will serve us in the future.<br>
Commander, I'd love your input.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
As Clemenceau said, we want you all to put your abilities on full display today.<br>
We look forward to a great fight.<br>
<br>
In the evening, the joint exercise ends without issue.<br>
Clemenceau compiles a report and hands it off to me.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Already finished your report? Impressive.<br>
(Hmm. Every faction did their very best, so I'd call this a roaring success.)<br>
(But Clemenceau still has a lot of ideas to improve it for next time.)<br>
(This line about the Iris fleet is probably the most biting criticism of all of them.)<br>
Too indecisive, lacking resolution, too conservative a strategy while also not having a backup plan...<br>
Unable to rally themselves back once they were at a disadvantage, ultimately leading to failure...<br>
(What is this pressure I've been feeling ever since we got back to the office?)<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Are you unhappy because of the Iris fleet's defeat?</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Clemenceau：</span><br>
Not especially.<br>
The results don't really matter, but... I don't like the naivete of the strategy they employed.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
That makes sense. It is just an exercise, so I can see why they'd hold back.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Clemenceau：</span><br>
Exactly. They're in for a rude awakening if they try this on a real battlefield.<br>
Being able to seize opportunities means more than just victory. It means making it more likely that you make it out alive.<br>
If they won't take these exercises seriously, then they'll be in danger on the battlefield.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
If you've learned that much about them, then it sounds like the exercise was worthwhile.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Clemenceau：</span><br>
Yes, Commander, you're right. I just...<br>
...I should have the Tribunal girls participate after all.<br>
Even leaving aside the question of mental readiness, I see that they've been without training for too long. I must discuss this with Richelieu and see it fixed.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Seems like she DOES care about if they win or lose...)<br>
<br>
*knock* *knock*<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">L'Opiniâtre：</span><br>
Lady Clemenceau, the party preparations are complete. Will the Commander be joining us today?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Clemenceau：</span><br>
But of course. We'll be there soon, so pass on my thanks and congratulations to everyone.<br>
I can't wait for the show today~<br>
<br>
Clemenceau flashes a gentle smile, causing L'Opiniâtre to stiffen up like she'd just seen a ghost.<br>
After replying that she'd "d-do her best," she turns and runs out of the office.<br>
Clemenceau changed her attitude so fast that I had to wonder where her competitive spirit from before had gone.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Clemenceau：</span><br>
I'm sure anyone but you would have missed that, Commander.<br>
But it is true that I'm not genuinely worried about the result.<br>
I have some opinions about their training, of course, but that doesn't mean I deny the effort they're putting in.<br>
They fought their hardest. They deserve rest.<br>
How's that for work-life balance?<br>
Of course, rest must be earned through hard work. That means that you and I can't rest yet.<br>
Heehee, bear with me just a little longer for the sake of the party. Okay, Commander?<br>

4 Rest After Hard Work<br>
After our work in the office, Clemenceau and I head to the party venue together.<br>
Along the way, she hands me a letter of invitation that she'd pulled out of seemingly nowhere.<br>
Unlike the informal oral invitation, this one is in an envelope bearing the Iris's seal.<br>
Which should mean that said party is a rather formal affair.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Clemenceau：</span><br>
If you're to be invited, Commander, even the most informal party must see proper etiquette observed.<br>
Oh, or were you looking forward to a dance party?<br>
Unfortunately, it's just a party to treat the girls. Don't worry; I'll make it up to you next time.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：I don't really mind...</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：Sounds great!</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Clemenceau：</span><br>
Shush, now. We're almost there. We can talk about it when we're alone again♪<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">L'Opiniâtre：</span><br>
Now, allow me to show you a miracle that you WON'T find in the sacraments... Huh? Wha?!<br>
Wh-why isn't it working...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dunkerque：</span><br>
Clemenceau, Commander. How do you like this round of handmade sweets?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Clemenceau：</span><br>
They're delicious. You never cease to improve your skills, Dunkerque.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Terrible：</span><br>
The tea... is very hot...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vauquelin：</span><br>
Ack! Sorry, Le Terrible! This is yours! See, it's lukewarm!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Terrible：</span><br>
Too hot... *pant* *pant*... It's still too hot...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vauquelin：</span><br>
Umm... Opie, is this thing not working?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">L'Opiniâtre：</span><br>
Oh? Let me take a look...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vauquelin：</span><br>
*cough* *cough*!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">L'Opiniâtre：</span><br>
*cough* *cough*... Why did it explode...?<br>
Vauquelin, don't tell me you did this...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vauquelin：</span><br>
I didn't do anything this time! Dunkerque and I prepped everything together!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dunkerque：</span><br>
Vauquelin was with me the whole time, so I can vouch for her. She didn't do anything wrong.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Le Terrible：</span><br>
Then these props must be defective...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">L'Opiniâtre：</span><br>
Ugh... I'll ask Akashi about it tomorrow.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dunkerque：</span><br>
By the way, Lady Clemenceau, it doesn't look like Jean Bart and Lady Richelieu are coming to the party...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Clemenceau：</span><br>
I understand. I'll pass the wine on later.<br>
<br>
The party is chaotic, but the laughter of friends fills the venue. It seems like everyone is enjoying the light mood.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Clemenceau：</span><br>
That's a strange look on your face. Did you eat something odd?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
No, no. All the food here is delicious. But...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Clemenceau：</span><br>
Surprised by the atmosphere of the party?<br>
Heehee, we Iris love to party, too. If rarely.<br>
We have so many unique members, after all.<br>
Besides, you can only truly begin a new training regimen by healing your fatigue and putting yourself in top condition.<br>
Isn't that right, Commander? Heehee!<br>

5 A Sharp Glare<br>
On one day off, I go to the bookstore with Clemenceau.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Clemenceau：</span><br>
............<br>
...Oh?<br>
.........<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Clemenceau?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Clemenceau：</span><br>
Oh, Commander, I'm sorry. I was so absorbed in this book.<br>
<br>
The book she's reading is called "On the Structure and Deconstruction of Drama."<br>
I'm a little surprised that she's interested in theater.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Clemenceau：</span><br>
Heehee, what's the matter? Do I look like I wouldn't be interested in fine arts?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
That's not it, but...<br>
From what I've seen of you, you don't seem the time to watch theater or opera.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Clemenceau：</span><br>
Because you've only seen me busy. But of course, as someone who always preaches to the girls about the importance of rest...<br>
Sometimes, I need to be a good example.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
And you do that by watching plays?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Clemenceau：</span><br>
Exactly. If you'd like, you should come with me next time.<br>
But let's leave talk of the future for later. For now, let's enjoy... this one.<br>
<br>
Clemenceau smiles and takes a new book off the shelf.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
A mystery novel?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Clemenceau：</span><br>
Yes. I like to pick a mystery novel, read only half of it, organize character relationships in my mind, and try to guess the culprit and their motive.<br>
Once I'm done, I read the rest and check whether I'm right...<br>
This is how I relax in my spare time.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Well, that's unique. In that case...<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：What happens if you're right?</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：And if you're wrong, then...?</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Clemenceau：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''It means my mind is still sharp, and I've gotten value from my relaxation.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Clemenceau：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''In that case, either the author is inexperienced at setting up satisfying puzzles, or...<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Heehee. I'm just kidding.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Clemenceau：</span><br>
Whether it's theater or deduction, really, there's no functional difference.<br>
What satisfies me is new information stimulating my brain and feeling my mind sharpened.<br>
It's fun, and sometimes, it brings inspiration.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Inspiration?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Clemenceau：</span><br>
Hmm, I think we'd be here for a long time if I tried to explain. First, why don't we just pick out our books?<br>
...I know. I choose this one. How about you, Commander?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Oops. I was so busy chatting with Clemenceau that I didn't pick a book...)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Clemenceau：</span><br>
Still not sure, hm? Heehee.<br>
Then why don't I presumptuously take the liberty of recommending one to you?<br>
<br>
Clemenceau smirks and takes another book from the shelf.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
("Death on the Nile." That's a famous one, isn't it?)<br>
(Okay, so she wants me to try relaxing like she does. Is that it?)<br>
Thanks. I'll give it a read.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Clemenceau：</span><br>
Good! I look forward to your thoughts, heehee♪<br>

Thanks to Clemenceau, we once again finish work early.<br>
While I'm walking through the woods, I hear girls' voices up ahead.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jean Bart：</span><br>
C'mon... You're really just gonna stand there and not help me out?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Clemenceau：</span><br>
Oh, did you need help? You sounded so excited, I thought you were having fun with those kitties.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jean Bart：</span><br>
Argh...!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Richelieu：</span><br>
Oh, Jean Bart, don't move. You'll make that poor little tabby fall.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jean Bart：</span><br>
Yeah, yeah...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Richelieu：</span><br>
Even when they're about to fall off, they keep trying to climb you... Heehee, these kitties really love you.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Clemenceau：</span><br>
You might just be as exciting as catnip to them! Haha, I'm jealous~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jean Bart：</span><br>
Gonna have to disagree there...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Richelieu：</span><br>
Being loved by cute little animals is a blessing from the Iris. You should be grateful.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jean Bart：</span><br>
Richelieu, please...!<br>
<br>
I follow the voices and find Jean Bart, covered in cats like some kind of cat tower.<br>
Richelieu waves a cat toy around next to her...<br>
...And Clemenceau looks on from the sidelines with a smile.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Richelieu：</span><br>
Good day, Commander.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jean Bart：</span><br>
Commander! Get over here and get these things off me!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Clemenceau：</span><br>
We didn't leave the office together for once, and yet we run into each other again. Heehee!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Jean Bart：</span><br>
"For once"...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Clemenceau：</span><br>
Enjoying a stroll, Commander?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I was just walking around, is all... Anyway, what are you punishing Jean Bart for?<br>
<br>
I can't imagine this is anything but a cruel punishment, especially knowing how bad Jean Bart is with small animals.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Clemenceau：</span><br>
Oh, please~ Richelieu simply said that she wanted to search for the lost kitty from the cat café.<br>
We had Jean Bart join in the search.<br>
Thanks to her help, we found the lost kitty. And we had such a good time in the process...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
So you used Jean Bart's innate characteristics to attract the cat... That's a clever strategy.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Clemenceau：</span><br>
Aww, thank you.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
But now that you've found it, surely you could release her...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Clemenceau：</span><br>
That is true... But I think she has some willpower left in her, so we're going to put her to work to keep Richelieu smiling!♪<br>

7 Veiled in White<br>
Eventually, Clemenceau used a cat toy to lure them all away from poor Jean Bart.<br>
After that, Richelieu took them back to the cat café, and Jean Bart's sister ships got her to go back to the Iris dorm.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Do you like cats, Clemenceau? You look like you're good at handling them...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Clemenceau：</span><br>
I wouldn't say I especially "like" them. I'm not the best person to keep a pet.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Why do you say that?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Clemenceau：</span><br>
Well, I don't like having to share the things I care about...<br>
If I have a pet, it must be all mine.<br>
It can't beg others for affection, and I don't want anyone touching it.<br>
After all, if I'm to give it all of my love, then I want that in return.<br>
(Though of course, even I know that I couldn't monopolize you if you were to become my pet...)<br>
Heehee, anyway, that's enough talk of pets.<br>
It's getting dark. Shall we get dinner?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Is your schedule free for once?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Clemenceau：</span><br>
Of course. Even if I had plans, I'd drop them the moment you invited me out.<br>
I already have a reservation at a restaurant with wonderful reviews. I've wanted to go there with you.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
When did you...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Clemenceau：</span><br>
I'll never tell♪<br>
<br>
After dinner, Clemenceau and I watch a play together.<br>
When we leave the theater, the sky is already full of shining stars.<br>
Despite the influx of work lately, I've been able to relax outside of work hours. That's all thanks to Clemenceau.<br>
Maybe I'm finally experiencing that "work-life balance" that she mentioned.<br>
Looking for books at the bookstore, watching plays at the theater, going to cat cafés and shopping, and...<br>
Now that I think about it, I've spent all of my extra free time with her...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Clemenceau：</span><br>
Oh? You finally figured it out, didn't you?<br>
I didn't pick that mystery novel out for you just to help you relax.<br>
I've kept a strict hold on your schedule in order to take advantage of my secretary ship position, adjust your plans, and make time just for us...<br>
You know, it takes a lot of ingenuity to keep one Commander all to myself in a port practically bursting with girls.<br>
<br>
Before I can comment on how perfectly she'd caught me in her trap, Clemenceau comes closer and pulls me into a hug.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Clemenceau：</span><br>
I've already taken care of almost all of tomorrow's work, too.<br>
The night is young... Where will it take us next~?<br>
