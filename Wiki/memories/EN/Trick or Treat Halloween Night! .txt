<br>
I 「In Search of Lost Ghosts!」<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cleveland：</span><br>
Heya!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:87}：</span><br>
Wow~ It’s so big!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:6}：</span><br>
Is this the “Super Pumpkin Lantern” that we’re showing off today?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cleveland：</span><br>
Sure is! The pumpkin was home grown and then carved out! With everyone’s help, we were able to create such an awesome pumpkin lantern!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:19}：</span><br>
By the way, I've made delicious pies stuffed with pumpkin filling inside!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cleveland：</span><br>
Oh, I just can’t wait, let’s try out these effects, quickly!<br>
...Strange? Nothing’s happening? Could the lantern be malfunctioning?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:6}&{namecode:87}：</span><br>
……<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:87}：</span><br>
Oh...this seems troublesome, the party will start shortly tonight...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:6}：</span><br>
There seems to be something inside...the pumpkin’s mouth...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cleveland：</span><br>
Eh? Oh,gosh,you’re right! There’s a note!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:87}：</span><br>
“We have lost a ghost mingling amongst us at this Halloween party, only the combined power of three virtuous witches can send it home.”<br>
What does this mean?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:6}&{namecode:19}：</span><br>
“Three virtuous witches”?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bailey：</span><br>
Hehe, it’s time! Here comes the witch from the Rabbit Planet!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cleveland：</span><br>
Wow, a witch really did appear!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bailey：</span><br>
Let the rabbit witch help out Bailey!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:6}&{namecode:19}&Cleveland：</span><br>
Ooo-ahhh~<br>

<br>
II 「A Curious Witch」<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bailey：</span><br>
If Miss ghost can’t find her way home, then that’s so pitiful...<br>
Wait there, Bailey will help you for sure! “Pretty”, “Lucky”, let’s go!<br>
Hmm…saying is one thing, but where exactly is Miss ghost hiding?<br>
Also ghosts can fly, right? But Rabbit Alien cannot fly...<br>
Well, if only the broom could carry her and let her fly like a witch.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">???：</span><br>
Hey, did you hear? Rumor has it the warehouse at home port is haunted!<br>
Really? I heard about that as well! Something about ghosts lurking in the warehouse...<br>
How is that possible! Even though it’s Halloween, but actual ghosts shouldn’t exist!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bailey：</span><br>
(Warehouse? Ghosts? Could it be…)<br>
 “Pretty”, “Lucky”, let’s head over there!<br>
Just let me, Bailey, unravel the mysteries of the hidden ghost lurking at port!<br>
Although, “Three virtuous witches”...if you count Bailey as one of them, then who are the other two...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:48}：</span><br>
Hey...ghosts or whatever, they seems so scary. B-but...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bailey：</span><br>
Ah! I found a new Witch!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">???：</span><br>
It’s tiresome to impersonate voices of multiple people...<br>
Just as we planned! Well, good luck, everyone!<br>

<br>
III 「A Witch Scared of Ghosts」<br>
How much longer...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagara：</span><br>
What's wrong, Isuzu? Are you worried about Miss ghost that Shouhou was telling you about?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:48}：</span><br>
Eh? Nagara-chan? How did you know——<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagara：</span><br>
Of course, I heard about it from Shouhou~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:48}：</span><br>
I, I really can’t do it, ghosts are just too much for me...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagara：</span><br>
But, if Miss ghost can’t find her way back home, then she’ll wander the port area forever.<br>
What if one day you bump into Miss ghost, wouldn’t it be more troublesome then?<br>
Think about it this way, if you help the ghosts return home, wouldn't there be less to worry about?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:48}：</span><br>
Hmm…yea, That's true...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nagara：</span><br>
You can do it, Isuzu! I believe in you~<br>
<br>
Back to present...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bailey：</span><br>
Ack! I found a new Witch~ Hey!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:48}：</span><br>
Ack~!!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bailey：</span><br>
Wow! You, you scared the heck outa me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:48}：</span><br>
Huh?... So it turned out to be Bailey, you are the…Witch?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bailey：</span><br>
Yea~ Heehee. Is Isuzu also trying to find Miss ghost?<br>
Hey, let me tell ya, I just heard that Miss ghost is actually in the warehouse!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:48}：</span><br>
Miss ghost…? Um, yes, yes I was umm searching for Miss ghost.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bailey：</span><br>
Then why don’t you join me and we’ll head to the warehouse together. Let’s go~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:48}：</span><br>
Yes, yes! Together!<br>
(If I got someone to come along...then I’ll be less afraid!)<br>

IV 「A Witch Afraid of Troubles」<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Rodney：</span><br>
Sister, did you hear the latest gossip about Miss ghost lurking around the port area?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nelson：</span><br>
You heard about it from Cleveland? It seems awfully like a prank...<br>
Regardless, I’m not interested.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Rodney：</span><br>
Pfft, here you go again. You were all like “I’m not interested” during the summer time as well.<br>
You could have joined us if you didn't hesitate to put on your swimsuit~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nelson：</span><br>
S-Swimsuits are shameless...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Rodney：</span><br>
Alright, so now it’s finally Halloween~ Let's all get together and have fun with everyone!<br>
As it so happens, I’ve got a witch costume on hand right here~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nelson：</span><br>
Where did you get this...h-hold on, at least let me change into it myself!<br>
Sigh...such a troublemaker...that Rodney. Half the time I don’t know what goes on in that mind of hers.<br>
“Three Witches” whatever...it’s just a gossip. Let’s walk around and deal with it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bailey：</span><br>
I caught the third Witch!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nelson：</span><br>
Wow! -- So it turns out to be you girls...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:48}：</span><br>
Is Ms. Nelson also one of the "virtuous witches" who is looking for the “Miss ghost”?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nelson：</span><br>
Ha? Um, yea, sure...<br>
(Crap, I blurted that out)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:48}：</span><br>
Now all three have shown up, great...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bailey：</span><br>
Then let’s head to the warehouse, Bailey heard Miss ghost is there!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nelson：</span><br>
(Even though it’ll surely be a prank, it’s not good to leave these kids alone and not help...I’ll follow them then).<br>

V 「Helper From A Coffin?」<br>
Port area, Warehouse<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bailey：</span><br>
Miss ghost~! Come out, come out! Everyone is worried about you!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:48}：</span><br>
If you shout like that, you’ll scare her away...<br>
Also, it’s dark in here, I feel like something ominous will...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bailey：</span><br>
Miss ghost——! Hurry...huh? What’s over there? A coffin?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:48}：</span><br>
Ack! A C-Coffin?!!!!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bailey：</span><br>
Let’s open it first! Allow me!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nelson：</span><br>
Wait——<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Terror：</span><br>
Boo! Surprise, surprise~~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:48}：</span><br>
Ahhhh!!!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bailey：</span><br>
O gosh, suddenly someone appeared!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nelson：</span><br>
You are...Terror?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Terror：</span><br>
Sigh…I need to practice more on how to scare people.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:48}：</span><br>
I thought it was a zombie or something, you scared me...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nelson：</span><br>
…Why are you in a coffin, Terror?<br>
Wait, why is there a coffin in the warehouse in the first place...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Terror：</span><br>
Terror cannot say, Terror is keeping a promise...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bailey：</span><br>
Ah! Quick, look over there!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:48}：</span><br>
Hey, M-Miss ghost has appeared!!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nelson：</span><br>
Who is it?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bailey：</span><br>
She’s running away! Chase her!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Terror：</span><br>
Wait...take this. It is “Witch’s Broomstick”.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bailey：</span><br>
Wow, exactly one broomstick per person...we must catch up to that ghost!<br>
Don’t think you can easily escape from us! I’m coming for ya!!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:48}：</span><br>
Bailey, don't rush...<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bailey：</span><br>
Over here!<br>
No! Over there!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nelson：</span><br>
Huff...puff...I can’t believe we chased her all the way to the rooftop...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:48}：</span><br>
I, I can’t run any longer...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nelson：</span><br>
There’s nowhere left for you to run. Who are you exactly? What are you up to?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bailey：</span><br>
Miss ghost, Bailey and the others are not here to scare you, we’ve come all the way here to help you!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">???：</span><br>
……<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nelson：</span><br>
Sh-she flew away?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:48}：</span><br>
Wh-what now! We can’t fly…<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bailey：</span><br>
F...Fly! I just got this broomstick! Could it be time for me to...jump!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nelson：</span><br>
Wa-wait! Wait wait wait, you’ll fall off the roof if you jump.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:48}：</span><br>
She...she’s flying….she’s ACTUALLY flying?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bailey：</span><br>
Hmph, don’t think that you can escape this time!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nelson：</span><br>
No way, what’s with this broomstick...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bailey：</span><br>
Hahaha~ I’m now a flying Witch~ Quick, come join me Isuzu, Nelson~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nelson：</span><br>
Wait——<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:48}：</span><br>
Wahahaha! I’m actually flying! I...am...flying!<br>
Broomstick, catch up to them…!<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">???：</span><br>
This is not a dream. Here, let me push you~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nelson：</span><br>

VII 「Happy Halloween!」<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:48}：</span><br>
Finally, I’m back on the ground...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bailey：</span><br>
We’ve finally caught up to you, Miss ghost!<br>
...Eh? ...a glowing aircraft and a white cloak? What? Why is everyone here?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
What’d you all think! That was Sara’s amazing airplane maneuvering skills!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bailey：</span><br>
Eh! So in the end, it was only Saratoga playing a prank on us?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Albacore：</span><br>
Hehehe, I also helped!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">???：</span><br>
“Hey, did you hear? Rumor has it the warehouse in Port area is haunted!”... <br>
“How is that possible!”... “Even though it’s Halloween, actual ghosts shouldn’t exist!”<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bailey：</span><br>
The voice I heard that time was actually from Albacore!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Albacore：</span><br>
Hehehe, looks like my acting chops were not bad~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nelson：</span><br>
Even if ghost is a prank, how can you explain what happened just now with the...broomstick, eh,where is the broomstick?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Terror：</span><br>
Well that...Yuubari just collected all of them. She said for the next test, they still need to be adjusted...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bailey & Isuzu & Nelson：</span><br>
Terror?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nelson：</span><br>
Is this typical for Halloween...I mean I knew it was going to be a prank, but I didn’t expect you girls to use the research tech from our Port laboratory.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bailey：</span><br>
Bailey really enjoyed flying in the sky! Bailey wants to do it again!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{namecode:48}：</span><br>
So, Miss ghost will not appear again...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
Relax relax, we should consider this “Happy Halloween Trick or Treat” to be a success, nyaa~<br>
This is the pumpkin pie prepared by Kagerou? Great, let’s dig in everyone~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Rodney：</span><br>
Sister, how does it feel to fly?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nelson：</span><br>
Wow, this turned out actually not bad...ah! Rodney! You knew all along from the beginning!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Rodney：</span><br>
Hehe, I knew right after I received the costumes from Akashi. No harm no foul, you seemed to have enjoyed yourselves~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
Hmm…after such a public showing, those witch costumes must be sold out by now, Akashi is such a genius!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nelson：</span><br>
That means the original culprit must be Akashi?!?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
Meow?! Pur...Nyaa~ There’s not much time left for Halloween, please take advantage and enjoy the remainder of your time!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bailey & Isuzu & Terror：</span><br>
OK!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Nelson：</span><br>
wait wait,Don’t change the subject! <br>
