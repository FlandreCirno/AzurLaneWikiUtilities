Intoxicating Feelings<br>
<br>
1 When the Grapes Ripen<br>
Vineyard - Trail of Trellises<br>
When I finally get a day away from work, Dunkerque invites me to an Iris-managed vineyard.<br>
The vineyard is quiet, but full of color and life. As we walk through it, my nose is treated to the sweet scent of grapes.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dunkerque：</span><br>
Do you like it here, Commander?<br>
I find the wind makes me want to take a deep, full breath.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
It's comfortable, that's for sure. I could relax here all day.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dunkerque：</span><br>
That's wonderful.<br>
I know I invited you, but I worried that I'd disrupt your plans.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Not really. It's a good change of scenery for my day off.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dunkerque：</span><br>
I'm relieved to hear that.<br>
<br>
As we continue down the path, I feel the stone slabs beneath my feet warming under the sunlight.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dunkerque：</span><br>
This vineyard has over a hundred years of history behind it.<br>
And the wine brewed from the grapes grown here is world-famous.<br>
They grow other fruits here, too.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
You know a lot about this place, don't you?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dunkerque：</span><br>
I wouldn't go that far.<br>
I just... come here for a stroll once in a while, since the atmosphere is so nice.<br>
Plus, you get to watch the crops grow and enjoy the fruits when they're ready.<br>
And watching the grapes grow day by day...<br>
It makes me think of how generous and sweet the flow of time can be.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Is that why you brought me here?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dunkerque：</span><br>
Heehee, I do want to help you relax, yes...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
You make it sound like there's another reason.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dunkerque：</span><br>
That's right. Perceptive as ever, Commander.<br>
I've been thinking of a new confection.<br>
My main goal today was to try and find some kind of inspiration.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Such as?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dunkerque：</span><br>
The sunshine, the breeze, having someone walking by my side...<br>
Anything can be a source of inspiration.<br>
The soft sunlight might evoke fresh-baked chiffon cake.<br>
Suck in a deep breath, and you'll smell the sweet and tart aroma of berries on the wind.<br>
Morning dew glistens on the berries' surface... Isn't it beautiful?<br>
With a little of that natural sourness left in, these would make a perfect wild strawberry flan.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
What about the person walking by your side?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dunkerque：</span><br>
Commander, what level of sweetness do you like in your desserts?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：A little light, so it doesn't overwhelm.</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：The sweeter, the better.</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dunkerque：</span><br>
So that's your preference...<br>
<br>
She nods, seemingly taking note of the answer.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dunkerque：</span><br>
Thank you for sharing.<br>
I like walking and talking with you like this. It's so much better than racking my brain over a recipe on my own.<br>
Sweets are made to be shared with others, after all.<br>
If, when you take that first bite, it reminds you of today's wind and how you feel right now... then I'll consider that a success.<br>

<br>
2 Taste of the Times<br>
Vineyard - Trail of Trellises<br>
We keep on walking down the trellis-lined path.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dunkerque：</span><br>
This is where they grow the white grapes.<br>
Get a little closer, and you'll smell them.<br>
<br>
Clusters of crystalline white grapes hang low from the trellises. We lean in for a sniff.<br>
A slight fruity aroma mixes with the fresh scent of grass. Together, they're gentle and refreshing.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Smells nice and sweet.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dunkerque：</span><br>
If I could use this scent in a fruit flan...<br>
I'd only have to add the slightest touch of sugar.<br>
Making it too sweet would overwhelm its distinct flavor, after all.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
You're such a professional.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dunkerque：</span><br>
Thank you, heehee. That compliment makes it worth all the effort.<br>
<br>
We pass beyond the white grapes and into the area where the dark-colored grapes are grown.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dunkerque：</span><br>
These are the ones they use to make red wine.<br>
Have a sniff. You might find the scent is mellower.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Hmm... There's a light, fruity acidity, but it's balanced by a hint of woodiness.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dunkerque：</span><br>
You have a sharp nose, Commander.<br>
Which do you like more? The white grapes, or the red grapes?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Maybe the white?</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：I think I like the red more.</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dunkerque：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''I see... But these white grapes haven't fully ripened yet...<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''That's a problem.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dunkerque：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''I see... The red ones are prime for the picking.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Thank goodness.<br>
<br>
She whips out a notebook and jots something down.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
What are you writing?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dunkerque：</span><br>
Nothing. Just notes.<br>
I tend to forget my best ideas if I don't write them down.<br>
<br>
She explains it away well enough, but I have a good enough eye to notice that she's hiding her notes from me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dunkerque：</span><br>
Now, Commander.<br>
Would you like to see the wine cellar?<br>
It has its own unique aroma.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I look forward to it.<br>
<br>
Down the stone path, we arrive at a short stone building.<br>
We go down the stairs and find a place where the scents of oak and fermentation mix.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dunkerque：</span><br>
What a wonderful smell...<br>
It feels warm, and peaceful... and it has the weight of time to it.<br>
<br>
Rows of oak barrels are lined beneath dim lighting. The iron hoops around them have a dull sheen.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dunkerque：</span><br>
But unfortunately, there are so many wines here that you can't distinguish them by smell.<br>
Do you have any wine preferences, Commander?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I'd like to hear your recommendation.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dunkerque：</span><br>
My recommendation... Hmm, not an easy question.<br>
It depends on the situation, really.<br>
If paired with a hefty chocolate dessert, then I'd go for a red with a ripe, fruity aroma and silky tannins.<br>
Merlot or Cabernet Sauvignon will contribute depth to the chocolate flavor...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I didn't think you knew this much about wine, too.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dunkerque：</span><br>
Food and wine have a symbiotic relationship. They benefit each other.<br>
It's only natural that I'd learn a little.<br>
If you'd like, try one of my recommended pairings with dinner tonight.<br>
We can take our time over dessert...<br>
And pick out the one that suits the mood most.<br>

3 Brewing a Sweet Moment<br>
Vineyard - Restaurant<br>
We left the wine cellar and headed to the vineyard's on-site restaurant together.<br>
The juice, jam, dried fruit, and homemade confections there are all made from the vineyard's own fruits.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dunkerque：</span><br>
Here, Commander.<br>
They make all their food using crops from the vineyard's own harvest.<br>
<br>
She shows me to a table, where an inviting spread awaits: small glass jars of jam, delicate baskets of dried fruit, and juice that glows with vibrant color.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dunkerque：</span><br>
Let's start with the white grape jam.<br>
Have it on a fresh-baked baguette.<br>
<br>
She slices bread for me and gently spreads the jam onto it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dunkerque：</span><br>
Jam alone can overwhelm your palate with sweetness.<br>
The bread will neutralize that.<br>
<br>
I accept it and take a bite.<br>
The crispy bread and soft jam mix in my mouth, and the fresh flavor of white grapes practically bursts.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dunkerque：</span><br>
How is it?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
It's refreshing and subtly sweet. Just the right amount.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dunkerque：</span><br>
So this combination is preferred? Noted...<br>
<br>
She takes out her notebook again and swiftly writes something down.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dunkerque：</span><br>
Next... Raisins.<br>
<br>
She expectantly pushes over a small tray and waits for me to taste them.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
You're not going to eat?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dunkerque：</span><br>
Oh, umm... I'd rather hear your thoughts than taste them myself.<br>
<br>
I avail myself of the offer and pop one in my mouth.<br>
Unlike the light sweetness from before, these are much richer. It's as if they've been candied.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Mm... Maybe a little too sweet.<br>
I'd probably want it with something else.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dunkerque：</span><br>
I see... These dried fruits might be better used to adorn a cake.<br>
Hmm... Are there any better combinations?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
How about we reverse roles for a bit?<br>
Special-made berry jam? Hmm...<br>
I think this would be great with a fresh-baked croissant.<br>
<br>
I tear off a bit of the croissant, gently spread some thick berry jam onto it, and offer it to her.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dunkerque：</span><br>
Huh?<br>
<br>
She looks surprised, but she readily accepts it and opens her mouth just a little.<br>
When she bites some off, the vivid berry color gets onto her lips, as if spring has touched her.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dunkerque：</span><br>
...It's delicious.<br>
<br>
She wipes the jam off of her mouth with her fingertip. A little smile spreads across her face.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
You're in an unusually good mood today.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dunkerque：</span><br>
A-am I?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Yeah.</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：It's not too noticeable.</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Something about you is livelier than usual.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dunkerque：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Is it that easy to tell?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''You almost had me fooled.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dunkerque：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Heehee. Well, I suppose I'm good at hiding my feelings.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dunkerque：</span><br>
It's not a particularly big deal...<br>
You're just playing a very important role for me today.<br>
<br>
From her position on the other side of the table, she smiles at me with gentle eyes.<br>
...As if, after a long time, she's finally made up her mind to share a big secret with me.<br>

<br>
4 The Secret to Tenderness<br>
Vineyard - Restaurant<br>
Sunlight shines gently upon the table, causing the grape vines to cast shadows.<br>
Dunkerque stands between light and shadow, seemingly enveloped in a mysterious aura.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dunkerque：</span><br>
The truth is...<br>
My inviting you today... wasn't just to get you out for a change of scenery.<br>
I've always thought of how I can make the perfect confection just for you.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Just for me?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dunkerque：</span><br>
Yes... The taste, aroma, mouthfeel, and even minor details like decorations...<br>
I want them all to suit you perfectly.<br>
So I've been taking notes...<br>
About every little thing today.<br>
<br>
She opens her notebook and shows me the contents.<br>
Among her notes are a few well-drawn pastry designs.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dunkerque：</span><br>
I drafted these before.<br>
But I plan to calibrate them based on today's inspiration and my notes on your preferences.<br>
<br>
Alongside drawings of different desserts, the page is filled with countless little brainstormed ideas jotted in the margins.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dunkerque：</span><br>
Tarts with Cabernet Sauvignon jam...<br>
Vanilla cream cheese roll cakes with raisins...<br>
Of course, there's room to improve any of them.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：(Leave it to her.)</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：(Help her think.)</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''It's up to you. Leave the thinking to the professionals, and all.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dunkerque：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''But if you have any ideas...<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''I might be able to come up with something that suits your taste better.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''If you're baking them for me, then I should help out.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dunkerque：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Heehee. If we make them together, I'm sure the flavor will be outstanding.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''I look forward to your help, dearest assistant.<br>
<br>
We sit at the table and adjust her recipes together, one by one.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dunkerque：</span><br>
Hmm... The original idea was a white grape mousse mille-feuille.<br>
With white grape jelly between layers of puff pastry and mousse...<br>
But after looking around here, I don't think the white grapes are ready.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Then what about another fruit?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dunkerque：</span><br>
Hmm... Greengages may work.<br>
They have the right balance of sweet and sour, along with a refreshing scent.<br>
A greengage mousse cake... that could be the one.<br>
It would maintain the mouthfeel while also having a lighter flavor.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
It is a major change of plans, but I think it fits the mood well.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dunkerque：</span><br>
And this one... I wanted to make rum baba that incorporates the mellow flavor of Cabernet.<br>
But now, I'm starting to think that a bolder combination is in order.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Bolder? How so?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dunkerque：</span><br>
For example, sprinkling lightly roasted sea salt caramel crumble on a Cabernet jam tart.<br>
Adding some saltiness to the mellow, sweet flavor...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Yeah... The salt would amplify the sweet, wouldn't it?<br>
It has more depth than raw sweetness alone.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dunkerque：</span><br>
See? You do understand, Commander.<br>
<br>
She scribbles a few more notes.<br>
Her fingertips tremble a little... as if her excitement is uncontainable.<br>

5 Team Effort<br>
Vineyard - Kitchen<br>
After deciding on the recipes, we go to the vineyard kitchen together.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dunkerque：</span><br>
Now, the desserts we're going to make today are...<br>
Greengage mousse cake...<br>
Cabernet jam tarts with sea salt caramel crumble...<br>
Cultured butter scones, Breton cookies with raspberry puree...<br>
And finally, blueberry and almond tartlets.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Sounds like a lot of work.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dunkerque：</span><br>
That's exactly why I need a helpful assistant.<br>
<br>
She smiles and hands me an apron.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I'll try not to hold you back.<br>
<br>
The kitchen is bright and spacious, with no shortage of professional equipment.<br>
We already have the necessary ingredients. The scent of milk and berries already wafts about.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dunkerque：</span><br>
I'll take care of the delicate parts.<br>
Can you whip the cream and mix the puree for me, please?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Got it. Leave it to me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dunkerque：</span><br>
Use some elbow grease when you whip cream, but try not to overdo it.<br>
You want it to have stiff peaks that hold their shape.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：(Stir vigorously.)</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：(Stir carefully.)</span>'''''<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''I start whipping the cream with all my strength... and instantly, cream goes flying all over the place.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''I whisk slowly and carefully... but the cream fails to thicken.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dunkerque：</span><br>
Don't worry. Everyone has trouble at first.<br>
Happy accidents are part of the fun of cooking.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I guess I need some professional guidance.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dunkerque：</span><br>
Heehee, gladly. I'll teach you all of the forbidden secrets.<br>
<br>
After tidying up the table, we continue preparing scones and tarts.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dunkerque：</span><br>
Now, shaping scones is a matter of speed. You have to do it before the butter melts.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Okay. So we go quickly, precisely, and firmly, right?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dunkerque：</span><br>
No, actually, it's the opposite. You want to be gentle, not firm.<br>
<br>
She puts her hand on mine and guides me in shaping a scone.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dunkerque：</span><br>
Now, relax and slowly round it like this.<br>
<br>
Her hair brushes against me, and the scent of her shampoo spreads.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dunkerque：</span><br>
There you go. Relax, relax...<br>
Your hands are usually so dexterous. Why do you get nervous when you're making desserts?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Because a professional is teaching me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dunkerque：</span><br>
Oh? Do I seem like that stern a teacher to you?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Maybe it just makes me want to do it right.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dunkerque：</span><br>
Don't worry. An imperfect shape won't affect the flavor.<br>
Most of all, this is something we're making together.<br>
<br>
Despite her professional guidance, it takes a while before we can get the desserts into the oven.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dunkerque：</span><br>
Even if it doesn't go perfectly, it's going to be a precious memory.<br>
I can't wait to taste the desserts we make together...<br>

6 Flavor in Harmony<br>
Vineyard - Terrace<br>
As we finish up the desserts, we arrange them on plates before taking them out to the terrace.<br>
The sun is beginning to set, dyeing the sky orange and red. Wind carries the sweet smell of grapes to us.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dunkerque：</span><br>
Let's sit here, Commander. The view from here is the best.<br>
<br>
She pulls out a chair and urges me to sit.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dunkerque：</span><br>
Pairing desserts with wines can bring surprising nuances and elevate their flavors.<br>
But first...<br>
<br>
She takes several bottles of wine out of a cart behind her and lines them up on the table.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dunkerque：</span><br>
First, let's taste-test.<br>
That should make the changes in flavor more clear when we add dessert to the mix.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Yeah. You have to know how it tastes alone to identify the change.<br>
<br>
She nods quietly, pours a light-colored wine into a glass, and hands it to me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dunkerque：</span><br>
The first one is a sweet white Riesling produced here.<br>
On the nose, it's light and floral, with notes of fruit. The palate is clean and delicate.<br>
<br>
I accept the glass and take a small sip.<br>
Its balanced sweetness and acidity spread across my tongue, leaving a long, memorable finish.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Refreshing, but delicate. It has a lingering fruity scent, too, which is comforting.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dunkerque：</span><br>
Right? Let's move on to the Pinot Noir. This one has notes of raspberry and cherry, and a brighter acidity.<br>
<br>
We clink our glasses and drink it all down.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dunkerque：</span><br>
Phew... That feels nice. Do you like it?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
It's more vivid and layered than the Riesling. Fascinating.<br>
<br>
As we continue to taste the wines, I notice a soft pink coloring Dunkerque's cheeks.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Do you feel okay?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dunkerque：</span><br>
Hmm? Why do you ask?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
You're a little red. Have you drunk too much?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dunkerque：</span><br>
Ah... Heehee, this is embarrassing.<br>
Maybe I drank a little too quickly.<br>
I'm okay, though. It'll settle once I've had food.<br>
On that note, shall we begin with the greengage mousse cake?<br>
Taste it with Riesling, and you might just be surprised by what you discover.<br>
<br>
At her direction, I scoop up some cake and eat it.<br>
The mousse is silky smooth, melting right on my tongue.<br>
I chase it with Riesling, and its acidity cuts through and amplifies the subtle fruitiness of the mousse, making the whole combination much brighter.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
It really is completely different...<br>
The wine itself was already light and refreshing, but now, it accentuates the fruity flavor.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dunkerque：</span><br>
That's right. Mousse and wine stimulate each other's flavors and make each other more pronounced.<br>
<br>
The evening begins to settle. In the fading light, Dunkerque's smile looks even softer.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dunkerque：</span><br>
You really do understand, Commander.<br>
Thank you for joining me... for experiencing how flavors overlap and collide with me.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
The marriage of dessert and wine is just fascinating.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dunkerque：</span><br>
Honestly, just piquing your interest makes me feel like I'm already more than halfway to success.<br>
But no matter how good the dessert and wine are, what really matters is who you enjoy them with...<br>
<br>
As the evening breeze blows upon the terrace, she quietly raises her glass and awaits a toast.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dunkerque：</span><br>
Everything today... The confections, the wine, and this scenery...<br>
All of it is special because you're with me.<br>

Intoxicating Feelings<br>
<br>
7 One Tipsy Night<br>
Vineyard - Terrace<br>
As night descends on the vineyard, the lights turn on, and the atmosphere gets even cozier.<br>
The tipsy Dunkerque is flushed pink, and her eyes seem to sparkle even more than usual.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dunkerque：</span><br>
These Cabernet Sauvignon jam tarts...<br>
I snuck a taste earlier, and I'm not sure they turned out right...<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Hmm. The balance of salty and sweet seems a little off, huh?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dunkerque：</span><br>
So it comes to that again...<br>
I thought the sea salt caramel crumble was awfully creative, but maybe I went too far with it.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Mistakes happen to everyone.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dunkerque：</span><br>
You think so? Okay, that's a relief...<br>
<br>
She tilts her head. Her voice and demeanor seem lighter than usual, probably as a result of her tipsiness.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dunkerque：</span><br>
Oh, right. The blueberry and almond tartlets! They turned out well, didn't they?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Yeah, incredibly well. Blueberry and cream work so well together.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dunkerque：</span><br>
Then as a reward, I'll eat one more!<br>
Oh... Commander, there's only one left.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Wanna split it?</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：First to grab it wins!</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dunkerque：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Good idea.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''I pick it up, about to break it in half. But then she leans in and takes a bite from the edge of the tartlet in my hand.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Her soft lips brush against my fingers, leaving a slight warmth behind.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dunkerque：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Mm... So good.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Honestly, it's even better than good.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Her face reddens even more. Her smile is equal parts bashful and mischievous.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dunkerque：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Oh? Confident, are we? Ready, seeeet...<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''As soon as I'm about to reach out, she seizes my hand.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Hey, now. That's just cheating.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dunkerque：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Heehee, a win's a win! But I don't mind sharing a bite...<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''She takes the tartlet and holds it up to my face. I take a bite, and her warm fingertips touch my lips.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dunkerque：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Careful now, Commander. You almost ate my finger, too.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dunkerque：</span><br>
...The thing that made me happiest today wasn't my successful baking, though.<br>
It was the fact that we did it together.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
I had fun, too.<br>
<br>
She leans in a little, gazing at me through misty eyes, as if she's trying to tell if I'm sincere or not.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dunkerque：</span><br>
Commander... Will you remember the flavors of today?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Of course I will.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dunkerque：</span><br>
I'm glad... I'll trust those words.<br>
<br>
She totters a little and leans on my shoulder.<br>
Her soft hair brushes my cheek. It tickles.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dunkerque：</span><br>
Then what about me...?<br>
Commander, will you remember the Dunkerque of today?<br>
Or will you only remember my desserts?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Are you drunk?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dunkerque：</span><br>
No... I'm not. I'm just a little too happy to bear...<br>
<br>
As she looks up at me in protest, her eyes twinkle like the stars.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dunkerque：</span><br>
Will you... make sweets with me again some time?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Of course. Any time.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Dunkerque：</span><br>
Good... I'll hold you to that.<br>
<br>
Dunkerque closes her eyes and leans on me.<br>
Tonight's sweets and wine seem to mingle among the stars, becoming an unforgettable memory between us.<br>
