<br>
1 The Lover's Heart Flutters On Duty<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Formidable：</span><br>
Phew...<br>
In an empty classroom after school, a certain well-bred young lady stretches on her tip-toes, doing her best to clean the blackboard.<br>
Based on how serious she looks, I don't think she's noticed my presence yet.<br>
While I consider helping her, she stretches even more to reach the top of the blackboard. By this point, her entire upper body is pressed against it.<br>
Chalk dust falls off of it... and straight into her eyes.<br>
Eep!<br>
Blinded by chalk dust, she steps back and trips over.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Be careful!</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
*cough* *cough*...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Formidable：</span><br>
Professor?! Are you okay?<br>
N-no, I can't possibly be that heavy... Surely you're fine...<br>
W-wait, that's not what's wrong...<br>
Anyway, thank you, Professor!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
(I know we're being filmed, but her calling me Professor still throws me off...)<br>
I'm fine. Here, let me erase the chalk at the top. Are your eyes okay, Formidable?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Formidable：</span><br>
Yes... They sting a little, but I'll be fine.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
I'll try blowing it out of your eyes. Stay still for me, okay?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Formidable：</span><br>
Huh? Okay... Thank you, Professor.<br>
Despite clearly blushing all the way to her ears, Formidable does her best to lean in and face me.<br>
U-umm... Will this do?<br>
She leans in close enough that our lips are mere inches from each other.<br>
Her sweet perfume and teary eyes have a bewitching power to them, coming ever so close to stealing my heart–<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
Hmm... It's a little hard to blow on your eyes at this angle...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Formidable：</span><br>
Geez, Comman–ahem! Professor!<br>
Okay... A little lower. All you need is for me to angle my head a little lower, right?<br>
She flips her long hair, evidently dissatisfied, and slowly looks down.<br>
But for some reason, she squats down low enough until her head is level with my waist.<br>
Professor? You won't tell me I'm too low this time, will you?<br>
Formidable looks up at me. There's a mischievous glint in her eyes and a grin on her face.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：A little, yeah...</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：No, I think it's perfect.</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Formidable：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''But I'm ever so tired, Professor. Why don't you bend over and find the right height yourself?<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Heheh, you did want to blow the chalk dust out of my eyes, didn't you?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Yeah, but it looks to me like you already cried it out...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Formidable：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Aww. Must you be so observant now, of all times?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Formidable：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Oh? Really, now?<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''But my head and your mouth are just so much further from each other now.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Why would you say this is perfect, I wonder?<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''It's okay. I already cried out the chalk dust, so I don't need your help anymore, Professor.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Formidable：</span><br>
With that, Formidable stands back up and twirls gracefully in front of me.<br>
*BEEP! BEEP!*<br>
Just then, the recording equipment beeps, signaling that it's stopped.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
Phew... Okay. Does that mean the recording is done?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Formidable：</span><br>
Not at all... Ahem. The recording may not yet be complete yet, Commander.<br>
Because a certain someone failed to follow the script.<br>
Heehee, I think we'll have to redo the scene at this rate.<br>
It's still early, so I expect you to give it another try now... my dear Professor~<br>

<br>
2 Brilliant Touchdown<br>
When the whistle is blown to signal the start of half-time, I find a good opportunity to run over to Prinz Eugen, who just scored minutes ago.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Good job, Prinz Eugen. That was a fantastic shot.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Phew... Heheh, I eat shots like that for breakfast.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
Well, you're doing great. Let's talk about our second half strategy.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Hmm? You think you need cheap little tricks when I'M around?<br>
I don't get much time to rest. If you've got time to talk about tactics on paper...<br>
...Then why don't you give me a little more direct help, Coach?<br>
Prinz Eugen looks up at me with a grin.<br>
Sweat slides down her cheek and falls onto her collarbone, leaving a damp trail behind it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
That being...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Come on, Coach. What do you think?<br>
I'm all sweaty and sticky, riiight?<br>
Prinz Eugen fans her chest with her hand.<br>
It's so hot... My clothes definitely aren't helping, either.<br>
I bet if I pulled this down a little, I'd be able to cool down... What do you think?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Nope! I brought you a towel and water!</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：How about we go back to the rest area and freshen up with a shower?</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Simple and practical, huh...<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Mmm, fine by me. I do kinda need that stuff right now.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''You're a real strategist, Commander. Thanks~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Pfft... That's a little long for such a short break!<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Don't forget, it's only half-time. There's a whole half of the game left.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Anyway, that's enough jokes. I see you brought a towel and water.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''I'll take those, thanks!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Clear water pours into her mouth like resplendent threads. Glistening with sweat, her throat twitches a little with each gulp.<br>
But the vigor of her drinking seems to be too much to handle. She chokes a little, and water rolls out of the corner of her mouth, adding a touch of wildness to her elegant motions.<br>
*gulp*... *gulp*... Phew! Much better.<br>
Hm? You've been staring at this water bottle for a while now.<br>
You thirsty, too?<br>
Aww! Well, I'm afraid it's too late.<br>
I'd love to let you have some, but that would be an indirect kiss, wouldn't it?<br>
Imagine that. Coach and star player, sharing an indirect kiss in the corner of the stadium. We can't let people see that!<br>
Still... It's a scorcher out, so I can't leave you thirsting for too long.<br>
How about a compromise?<br>
Prinz Eugen once again raises the bottle, taking a big sip of it.<br>
Then, she forcefully, swiftly, and precisely presses her face against mine.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Hold on–</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：?!</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Accompanied by the sound of a whistle, sweet and cold water flows into my mouth.<br>
Aaah... Looks like half-time's over. I'd better get ready for the second half.<br>
Hmm? Heheh, you look more excited for our "second half."<br>
Don't rush things. All in due time.<br>
First, the second half of the game. Then, the second half of our fun♥<br>

<br>
3 Troubled Seas<br>
Under a clear sky, Kongou holds a surfboard in her arms in wait for the "perfect wave."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kongou：</span><br>
Commander, do you remember the technique I taught you yesterday?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
Paddle first. Lay face-down on the surfboard, stabilize your weight, and use your ab muscles to support your upper body.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kongou：</span><br>
Yep. Then, you paddle alternating your left and right arms.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
Hmm... Any other tips I should keep in mind?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kongou：</span><br>
Tips... Keep your motions fluid and elegant, I suppose?<br>
The next steps are takeoff and riding. Put simply, you use your arm strength to stand up, and then you try to balance on your feet.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
Sounds easier said than done.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kongou：</span><br>
Heehee, it'll be okay. As long as your posture is proper and elegant, you'll do just fine.<br>
The final bailout is simple. When the wave passes by, you keep your posture as low as possible and then slowly get off of the board.<br>
By the way, this also needs to be done fluidly and elegantly.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
I see. So it's all about elegance, precision, and fluidity...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kongou：</span><br>
Heehee~ Remember that well, okay?<br>
Newbie surfers tend to panic the moment something goes wrong, and that only makes things more dangerous.<br>
It's important to practice often and earn the knowledge necessary to deal with any and all problems.<br>
Of course, I'll gladly protect you if anything goes wrong!<br>
Oh, look. A wave is already coming.<br>
Commander, check your gear and stay calm!<br>
A powerful wave rolls in.<br>
Kongou gets onto her surfboard. Pushed forth by the wave, we rush atop the water at high speed.<br>
Wooo! You're doing great!<br>
Not bad for a newbie, Commander!<br>
She skillfully keeps her balance as she turns around, smiles, and waves at me.<br>
Unfortunately, she fails to notice the even bigger wave silently lurking behind her.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Kongou, behind you!</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kongou：</span><br>
Huh... Wha? O-oh, no!<br>
After a desperate struggle, I manage to help Kongou back onto her surfboard.<br>
*pant*... *pant*... That was close...<br>
You really can't let your guard down for a second out here...<br>
I can't believe you're the one who had to help me out...<br>
She's still so shaken that she hasn't even noticed another pressing danger closing in on her.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">{playername}：</span><br>
(This is bad. Her board shorts are stuck on the surfboard's fin...)<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：(Tell her the problem.)</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：(Fix it directly for her.)</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kongou：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''C-Commander! What do you think you're doing?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Kongou：</span><br>
Huh? My board shorts?<br>
Eep! H-how scandalous...<br>
C-Commander, please don't look!<br>
Despite all the panic, we manage to deal with the danger.<br>
Ahahaha...<br>
I didn't expect you'd be seeing me in such an... unrefined way.<br>
Please keep what just happened a secret between us!<br>
In return for that...<br>
I know. Horseback riding, fencing, tea ceremony, surfing – whatever you want to learn, I'll be happy to help.<br>
What do you say? ...Heehee, okay, it's a promise!<br>
Oh, look. Another wave is coming.<br>
Commander, let's get ready to ride again!<br>
