A Prayer for Peace<br>
<br>
Chapter 1: Invitation to the Banquet<br>
At the Command Office...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
Commander, are you ready? Isn't it about time we get going?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Huh...?</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
Jeez, are you that sleep deprived? The banquet!<br>
<br>
Now that you mention it...<br>
A few days ago...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">King George V：</span><br>
Mm. I'll leave this invitation with you then. I look forward to meeting you there, Commander.<br>
After all, it was no small feat for Her Majesty to get the Iron Blood to co-sponsor an event like this.<br>
I'd be so very disappointed if you forget to come, Commander.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Of course I'll be there...</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">King George V：</span><br>
In that case, I'll be looking forward to having a dance with you. Hehe, just kidding~<br>
See you soon, Commander.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
Do you remember now? *sigh* ... Aren't you glad I came to get you?<br>
I heard that our fleet leader will be coming to tonight's banquet as well.<br>
Things might get a bit ugly if you don't show up on time... or at all.<br>
<br>
That's right... perhaps the real reason for tonight's banquet... was to celebrate "Her" return.<br>

Chapter 2: A Toast to our Gathering<br>
Port - Banquet Hall<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
Phew... We managed to make it on time... Ah! F-Fleet Leader!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck：</span><br>
Good to see you, Z23. And you, Commander.<br>
... Didn't I tell you before? There's no reason to be so formal around me. "Bismarck" will do just fine.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
Y-yes ma'am! Bismarck... ma'am!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck：</span><br>
Haha, you're as diligent as ever, Z23.<br>
The impeccably-dressed Bismarck had just entered the venue, surrounded by a small crowd of adoring Iron Blood ships. She had broken away from the crowd to greet us.<br>
Commander, well met. I'm grateful that you were able to join us tonight.<br>
<br>
She sounded like she was trying to sound more dignified on purpose.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck：</span><br>
I heard that we'll also be joined by our friends from the Eagle Union tonight.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
Yes ma'am! I handed invitations to them myself while coming back from the Royal dorms!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet：</span><br>
That's right! Since we're all here, we've gotta get along!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yorktown：</span><br>
Come on, Hornet. You can't be acting the way you usually do at a place like this. Oh my... Good evening, Commander, Bismarck.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet：</span><br>
Heheh! It's not every day we get to have a big party like this, so we've gotta enjoy it while we can! Isn't that right, Commander?<br>
As a matter of fact, I brought just the thing for the occasion! Let's kick things off right with some champagne~!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck：</span><br>
Hmm... that does seem quite appropriate.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yorktown：</span><br>
Thank you. In that case, I suppose I'll have the honors. Cheers!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Everyone：</span><br>
Cheers!<br>

Chapter 3 - May I Have This Dance?<br>
Towards the back of the Banquet Hall...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cleveland：</span><br>
It's a shame this was really the closest thing to a fitting party outfit I had... *sigh*...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
*giggles* I don't see anything wrong. It's cute and suits you well.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cleveland：</span><br>
Ahaha... Well, thanks. It doesn't hold a candle to yours though, Helena.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
Thank you. By the way, Cleve, there's a rumor going around about you. Something about how "you can wrap any girl around your little finger."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cleveland：</span><br>
Ah jeez, again with that. Cut it out with the teasing already!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
I'm sorry. You know I meant that as a compliment...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cleveland：</span><br>
Et tu, Helena? I'm still a girl, after all...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
I know, I know. Ah, is the music starting? The ball must have begun...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cleveland：</span><br>
The ball, huh... Since we're already here... It's decided!<br>
Would this ravishing beauty allow me to have a dance with her?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
Ah... of course! Hehe, it'd be my pleasure~<br>
Um, in that case, make sure to escort my properly... my knight in shining armor~<br>

Chapter 4 - A Novel Anniversary<br>
On the other side of the Banquet Hall...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Admiral Graf Spee：</span><br>
Who knew there would be so many people...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Deutschland：</span><br>
Hmph. Of course there are a lot of participants. Don't you see that this is also a battle for prestige between the Royal Navy and our Iron Blood?<br>
All you have to do is sit back and enjoy the show, Spee!<br>
You will soon witness that true elegance belongs only to the Iron Blood!<br>
Muahaha! Tonight, the Royal Navy shall bear witness to the terrifying cuteness of my little sister! Ah, Spee, there's something I have to do, so go ahead and enjoy the banquet first!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Admiral Graf Spee：</span><br>
Wait... Aww, she already ran off...<br>
Enjoy the banquet...? How am I supposed to do that?<br>
Um... is that Miss Yuugure over there... from the Sakura fleet?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yuugure：</span><br>
Ariake...? Eek?! I'm so sorry, I almost spilled juice all over you... Um, you're Miss Graf Spee from the Iron Blood, right?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Admiral Graf Spee：</span><br>
Don't worry about it. You didn't get anything on my dress anyway. How about you, though? You look like you're in a bit of a hurry.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yuugure：</span><br>
Um... y-yes... Actually...<br>

Chapter 5 - How to Enjoy a Banquet<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Admiral Graf Spee：</span><br>
I see... you got separated from your sister and your friends...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yuugure：</span><br>
Yes... I went to greet Commander, but then Yuudachi said something about fresh meat and bolted off.<br>
I went to chase after her along with Ariake and Shigure, but then got lost in the crowd...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Admiral Graf Spee：</span><br>
I-I see... There certainly are a lot of vibrant folks in the Sakura fleet.<br>
I'll help you look for your friends.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yuugure：</span><br>
R-really?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Admiral Graf Spee：</span><br>
Sure. I have no idea how I'm supposed to "enjoy the banquet" anyway.<br>
... Are those your friends over there?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shigure：</span><br>
Oyy, Yuugure! That's where you went! We were just wondering how you got lost in the blink of an eye.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ariake：</span><br>
Thank goodness, we were afraid you got lost. Hmm?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shigure：</span><br>
Huh? Graf Spee helped you find us?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ariake：</span><br>
Thank you very much for the help.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Admiral Graf Spee：</span><br>
Don't worry about it... I didn't really do anything...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yuugure：</span><br>
Actually, Miss Spee wanted to know about something!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shigure：</span><br>
"How to enjoy the banquet?" That's simple enough~<br>
I'm about to let you in on a little secret. See, the trick is, just do what you wanna do! You can go dancing like those two lovebirds over there. Or sink your fangs into some grub like Yuudachi over there.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Admiral Graf Spee：</span><br>
Do what I want to do, huh... Thanks for the help, Shigure, I think I have a better idea now.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shigure：</span><br>
Heheh! Don't mention it!<br>
Woah, what's that sound?<br>

Chapter 6 - A Brief Interlude<br>
Outside the Banquet Hall<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ark Royal：</span><br>
Hnnnng! There are so many cute destroyers all in one place!! I'm in heaven!!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Georgia：</span><br>
Don't make me get Enterprise, Ark Royal.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ark Royal：</span><br>
Woooooahh! Let's not get too trigger happy here. I'm just out here monitoring the situation, making sure no questionable individuals get in and whatnot. I'm absolutely not doing anything suspicious at all!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Georgia：</span><br>
Calm down. You're only drawing more attention to yourself like that.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ark Royal：</span><br>
Ah... Phew... It's just you, Georgia. What are you doing outside?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Georgia：</span><br>
Oh. It got a bit too noisy and stuffy in there, so I came out to get some fresh air.<br>
How are things on your end? Managed to get any good photos?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ark Royal：</span><br>
Guhehe... You bet, so many cute little destroyers...<br>
*cough* *cough* Ahem, I meant, no! This camera is solely for monitoring the perimeters. It definitely has no photos on it!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Georgia：</span><br>
Well, I'll leave you to it. I'd be careful, though.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ark Royal：</span><br>
Ah, um, thanks, I suppose... Huh? Who's that over there?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Georgia：</span><br>
Akashi? Woah, she even prepared those?<br>

Chapter 7 - Fireworks<br>
Port - Empty Field<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
Yuubari, Shiranui, are you two ready, nya?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shiranui：</span><br>
Ready when you are.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yuubari：</span><br>
On your count!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Akashi：</span><br>
All right, let's do this, nya. 3... 2... 1... light 'em, nya!<br>
<br>
Outside the Banquet Hall<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Georgia：</span><br>
Now that... is a nice sight.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Ark Royal：</span><br>
You can say that again. Oooh, the light in the destroyers' cute little faces! *click*<br>
<br>
Port - Banquet Hall<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Shigure：</span><br>
Look outside the windows - the fireworks are starting!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Yuugure：</span><br>
Oooh...!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Admiral Graf Spee：</span><br>
So pretty...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">King George V：</span><br>
Hehe... Akashi really outdid herself this time.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck：</span><br>
Wunderbar...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Z23：</span><br>
One day when the seas are peaceful, I'd like to see these fireworks again with everyone.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck：</span><br>
... ...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">King George V：</span><br>
Peace, huh...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Hornet：</span><br>
That's right! As long as we keep working hard with Commander, we'll definitely be able to return peace to the seas!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck：</span><br>
How cliché.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-556：</span><br>
Lord Bismarck! I also believe that such a day will come!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck：</span><br>
So it's you, U-556. Are you enjoying the banquet?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-556：</span><br>
Mmhmm! Everything's so delicious, I've been stuffing myself! I also ran into some familiar faces from the Royal Navy!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck：</span><br>
Lasting peace... with everyone else, huh?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">King George V：</span><br>
There's nothing to be afraid of. We're all friends here, fighting under the same banner. You're not alone anymore.<br>
Let tonight be a taste of the peace that we're all fighting for...<br>
<br>
I pray that one day... we will all be able to enjoy that peace together.<br>
