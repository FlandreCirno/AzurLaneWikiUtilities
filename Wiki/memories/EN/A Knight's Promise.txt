A Knight's Promise<br>
<br>
Chapter 1 - Good Morning, Commander!<br>
Port<br>
It was an ordinary lazy morning.<br>
If there was anything worth mentioning, it's that the day was secretary ship changing day.<br>
I looked at who would be the new secretary ship. It was a certain... U-556? She seemed like a really spirited girl. I hoped she'd be up to the task<br>
Considering she wouldn't be there so early, I resolved to head back to the office and tidy up a bit first. I knew I could explain the details to her once she came in...<br>
......<br>
I found the door unlocked... had I forgotten to lock it?<br>
I cautiously entered the office...<br>
......<br>
It turned out all the books and documents I needed to organize had been haphazardly stacked about the floor.<br>
Could... could this have been the work of desk elves!?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-556：</span><br>
Oh! Commander! You're here!<br>
<br>
A petite figure emerged from beneath my desk.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：U-556?</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-556：</span><br>
It's finally my turn to be secretary ship today, so I got up extra early!<br>
The door was unlocked when I got here, so I figured I'd see if there was anything I could do before you showed up, Commander!<br>
But it turns out all this stuff here is really complicated and I don't get it at all. I never knew a secretary ship had to do so much reading...<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Calm her down.</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-556：</span><br>
*Pant* ... *pant* ... You'll teach me what to do, right, Commander? Fantastic!<br>
I need to put all this stuff back in its place, right? Don't worry, I got this!<br>
U-556 flashed a confident smile.<br>
I think this folder goes... over here...<br>
Hm? That doesn't look right. Don't tell me I forgot... oh this one isn't right either. Neither is that one. Or this one. But this one should be...<br>
I'm boned. I can't make sense of this mess...<br>
I'm sorry, Commander, I totally forgot how it's supposed to go...<br>
<br>
In less than a minute, U-556 came begging for help.<br>
It seemed that before we could get into any of the real work, I would have to explain to her where every book and paper belonged.<br>

<br>
Chapter 2 - Are You Busy, Commander?<br>
After a bit of a hectic start, we finally got the day back on track.<br>
At first, U-556 needed a lot of guidance in performing her secretarial duties. But by mid morning she knew what she was doing and was ready to help with a workload a bit heavier than usual.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-556：</span><br>
Hmmhmmhmmm♪～<br>
<br>
She was engrossed in reading some After Action Reports. I decided to let her focus on her work.<br>
Fifteen minutes later...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-556：</span><br>
Ugh, I'm so bored! I thought being secretary ship would be easy and fun. I thought I'd just be playing with the Commander all the time...<br>
Heyyyy, Commanderrr! How about we knock off work and go play for a while!<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Tactfully decline her offer.</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-556：</span><br>
Awwww!<br>
U-556 looked a little dejected.<br>
Is this work really that important?<br>
<br>
It seemed like U-556 fundamentally misunderstood the relationship between commander and secretary ship. To her, they were little more than playmates.<br>
Still, the way she took to organizing the office and earnestly focused on her work from dawn until now was certainly praiseworthy... I decided to explain to her the meaning behind our efforts.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-556：</span><br>
Commander? What's wrong? Why do you suddenly look all serious...<br>
I get it now... Without you, the whole port wouldn't be able to function. The Commander's work is really more important than I ever thought...<br>
That's why I gotta help out!<br>
<br>
U-556 seemed like she understood what we were doing. So I took advantage of her enthusiasm and gave her some simple things to work on.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-556：</span><br>
Just hand this over to Akashi down at the shop? I'm on it!<br>
<br>
U-556 snatched the document out of my hand and flew out the door.<br>
It turned out that with the right spirit, she'd be able to handle something like this.<br>
......<br>
But by lunchtime, U-556 still hadn't come back.<br>

A Knight's Promise<br>
<br>
Chapter 3 - I Found You, Commander!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-556：</span><br>
S- sorry...<br>
I totally gave the thing to Akashi! But on my way back, I ran into U-81 playing with the girls and I kinda got caught up with them and forgot I was supposed to be working...<br>
But I definitely won't make that mistake again!<br>
Oh yeah! Tomorrow's a day off so why don't you come play with us, Commander? You know working all the time is bad for you!<br>
<br>
And so thanks to U-556's weird apology-turned-invitation, I ended up going to U-81's hide-and-seek party.---<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U81：</span><br>
Okay, everybody come draw straws to decide who's "it"!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-556：</span><br>
One... two...<br>
Ooh! It's me! I'm "it"!<br>
Heh heh. You just wait and see. I'll catch you all! 60, 59, 58...<br>
<br>
I thought carefully about where I should hide.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Go back to the office.</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：Go with U-81.</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项3：Hide right behind U-556's back.</span>'''''<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Nobody would ever think to hide the office. I decided that would be the safest place to stick it out.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''I made my way back to the office and quietly closed the door. Locking it would be against the rules, but I was already confident I had a perfect hiding spot.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''All I had to do was wait out the end of the game. Not to mention this was a great opportunity to get some work d-<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''*click click*<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-556：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''I found you, Commander!<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''MISSION FAILED.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Oh, right. I had forgotten U-556 was my secretary ship and therefore...<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''I determined that U-81, hide and seek pro that she was, would no doubt have a masterful hiding spot.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''It turned out she wanted to hide... underwater!?<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''I suppose it was only natural a submarine would want to hide underwater, but I found myself suffering certain limitations that meant...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-556：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''I found you, Commander!<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''MISSION FAILED.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项3）</span>'''''I determined that hiding in plain sight would be the best move. All I had to do was wait for U-556 to head off in search of the others, whereupon I would simply march up to the starting point and declare myself safe.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-556：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项3）</span>'''''20, 19, 18...<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项3）</span>'''''I just had to hold my breath long enough...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-556：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项3）</span>'''''2, 1, 0! Ready or not, here I come!<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项3）</span>'''''......<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项3）</span>'''''Commander? Did you think I wouldn't see you or what?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项3）</span>'''''MISSION FAILED.<br>
<br>
Thus ended the first round of hide-and-seek. Everyone gathered up once more.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U81：</span><br>
So the only one U-556 could find was the Commander?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-556：</span><br>
That's just because you guys had really good hiding spots!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">I-26：</span><br>
I really don't think the bathhouse pool is that good of a hiding spot...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Albacore：</span><br>
But why did she only find the Commander? And why so fast?<br>
... Hehehe. I'm thinking maybe you two have a special thing going, hmmmmm?<br>
<br>
I ignored Albacore's taunt and readied myself for the second round. This time I was "it", and I was committed to showing these girls who ran this port!<br>

<br>
Chapter 4 - It's a Date!<br>
Port - Office<br>
Under my tireless tutelage, she had managed to get her playful impulses under control, at least long enough to finish out a day's work.<br>
But there was so much more to being a secretary ship. I still had much to teach her.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-556：</span><br>
Good morning...<br>
<br>
U-556 seemed... rather blue?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-556：</span><br>
Oh, I was just spacing out a bit, sorry... What's on the agenda for today?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Ask her what's bothering her.</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-556：</span><br>
Hm, I guess nothing gets past you, Commander. Here's the story...<br>
Lord Bismarck! Let's play!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck：</span><br>
Oh? Is that U-556?<br>
Forgive me, I have some matters to discuss with the Royal Navy. It will have to wait.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-556：</span><br>
Lord Bismarck, are you busy?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck：</span><br>
Oh...<br>
As you can see, I am making preparations for our next exercise. I'm afraid I can't tear myself away.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-556：</span><br>
I guess she's just been really busy lately...<br>
I get that she's the leader of the Iron Blood, and she's got a lot on her plate. But it's just, without Lord Bismarck to play with, I feel kinda lonely...<br>
<br>
It was all becoming clear to me.<br>
The solution to this predicament was quite simple, actually.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-556：</span><br>
Huh? Commander... you'll spend your next day off with me?<br>
Really!?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：I made a promise to her.</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-556：</span><br>
Okay, it's a date! No takebacks allowed!<br>
Eheheh~♪<br>
<br>
I figured that would cheer her up, at least for a bit.<br>

A Knight's Promise<br>
<br>
Chapter 5 - A Mountain from a Molehill?<br>
Port - Office<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-556：</span><br>
Bam! That's it! We finished all the day's work!<br>
<br>
That was the quintessential U-556: as hard as she wanted to play, she could also put in the work when challenged.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-556：</span><br>
Tomorrow's your day off, Commander! Don't forget you promised to spend it with me. How about we go to the beach together?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Agree to take her to the beach.</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-556：</span><br>
Ehehheh~♪ I can't wait!<br>
<br>
It was to be a day of relaxation.<br>
......<br>
Until... we received a distress call from the patrol fleet?<br>
And the fleet on patrol that day was... Bismarck's!?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-556：</span><br>
Commander? What's wrong?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Tell her what happened.</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-556：</span><br>
Huh...?<br>
But wasn't Bismarck leading today's patrol...?<br>
I swore an oath to Lord Bismarck that I would protect her no matter what! ... Commander, we have to go help them!<br>
<br>
U-556 dashed out of the room with an incredible speed I never knew she had.<br>
She then gathered up some squadmates as quickly as she could and set off for the source of the distress signal.<br>
Nearby Waters<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-556：</span><br>
She'll be fine... she has to be!<br>
Huh? ... Lord Bismarck... and Prinz Eugen?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck：</span><br>
What is it?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-556：</span><br>
Thank the gods you're all right!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck：</span><br>
Just what on earth is going on here? Commander, would you mind explaining on the way back to port?<br>
<br>
Suffice it to say I was just glad everyone turned up safe and sound.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
So... we triggered a distress signal?<br>
It must be this thing. It's supposed to make an automatic assessment of any given combat situation and respond appropriately. I'm thinking it malfunctioned.<br>
<br>
It was a false alarm. I had them send the device off to the eggheads for inspection. No doubt Yuubari and her team could work it out.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-556：</span><br>
All that matters is that you two are safe.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck：</span><br>
Listen, U-556, I get that you take your promise seriously. But I really can handle myself without you. You don't have to worry.<br>
Not to mention today was just a routine patrol... I'm more than capable of rising to that challenge.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
……<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-556：</span><br>
Oh. Right. Of course...<br>
I mean, Lord Bismarck is one of the strongest battleships in the Iron Blood fleet. What's to worry about...? Heh heh...<br>
Right, well, I'd better be getting back...<br>
<br>
U-556 shuffled off dejectedly.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Kinda harsh, don't you think, Bismarck?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck：</span><br>
......<br>
<br>
I hurried after U-556, worried about how she was feeling.<br>

Port - Office<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-556：</span><br>
……<br>
<br>
……<br>
U-556 balled up in her chair, burying her head in her knees.<br>
The silence dragged on for what seemed like forever, until she finally spoke up.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-556：</span><br>
You know, don't you, Commander? I told you before, Bismarck and I made a "Promise."<br>
No matter where she is: on the water, under water, on land, or in the air, I swore to protect her from anything that tries to hurt her.<br>
But like, isn't that kind of a crazy promise? A submarine is gonna protect a battleship? How is that supposed to work...? Ahaha.<br>
I just keep using the promise as an excuse to go bother Lord Bismarck every day...<br>
I'm a pain in the ass.<br>
Whatever. Lord Bismarck is always telling us to change our bad habits. I'll just have to work that much harder on my missions. I mean of course, if Bismarck ever needed it I'd be there to help. I'd like to take some of the pressure off her.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck：</span><br>
No... I'm the one who should apologize.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-556：</span><br>
Lord Bismarck? Why are you here?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck：</span><br>
I've actually been here for quite a while. I was worried about you. It seems my words may have troubled you, and for that I apologize.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-556：</span><br>
No, no, you didn't do anything wrong. It's my fault for being such a brat and bothering you all the time.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck：</span><br>
That's not true. I have never thought you were a bother, U-556.<br>
In fact, I've always loved spending time with you. When we're together, I feel the burden of leadership lifted from my shoulders. For that short time, I get to relish the pleasure of chatting with a dear friend.<br>
I'd say your playfulness, your purity, and even your joy rubs off on me, U-556.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-556：</span><br>
Lord Bismarck...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck：</span><br>
To be honest, I never thought you would so bravely come dashing to my rescue, just to fulfill some jokey little promise from way back when...<br>
You are no bothersome child. You are a loyal knight who stands by her words, second to none, and worthy of respect. I am ashamed to admit I did not see that before. I am sorry.<br>
<br>
Bismarck suddenly stood up ramrod straight and loudly cleared her throat.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Bismarck：</span><br>
U-556! On the honor of the Parzival name, and before Neptune, lord of the seas, do you swear:<br>
That you will provide any assistance to me in a time of need, no matter where I may be, even at risk to your own life and limb?<br>
<br>
U-556 sat in stunned silence until a glittering smile flashed across her face.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-556：</span><br>
Yes! I swear anywhere, anytime, from any threat, U-556 will protect you!<br>

<br>
Chapter 7 - It's a Promise!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-556：</span><br>
We're going to the beach tomorrow?<br>
I mean you did promise me... But you really don't have to. I mean, it was just a silly idea I came up with, Commander, you don't need to waste your day off keeping me company.<br>
Keeping a promise is that important to you, huh? Well okay then I'll see you tomorrow! Eheheh~♪<br>
The open sea. I have arrived!<br>
Ahahahahaaa!<br>
<br>
U-556 launched herself into the ocean like a torpedo.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-556：</span><br>
Commander! Come on in! The water's fine!<br>
<br>
It was my day off. I figured I'd let myself go.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-556：</span><br>
Ahahaha! You're too slow, Commander!<br>
I'm gonna get you, Commander! Hope you're ready to taste seawater!<br>
Navy Destroyer "Commander's" anti-submarine warfare operations have failed! U-556 moves into counterattack position!<br>
<br>
Time flies when you're having fun. And before I knew it, the sun was setting.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-556：</span><br>
I never thought I'd get to spend the whole afternoon playing with you, Commander.<br>
Did you have fun?<br>
Eheheh~♪ ... Me too.<br>
If only Lord Bismarck could've come with us.<br>
... Hey, Commander, can I ask you something?<br>
Thanks to that promise we made, I got to see a different side of Lord Bismarck than the one she shows to everyone else. They think she's totally invincible, but she's actually really stressed.<br>
It may have started out as a silly little joke, but now our promise truly binds me and Bismarck together!<br>
So how about it, Commander? Will you make a promise with me?<br>
I, U-556, hereby declare before Neptune, lord of the seas, that from this moment onwards, I will provide any desired assistance to my Commander, at any place on the water, under water, on land, or in the air!<br>
Oh, but you're not Lord Bismarck, Commander, so I have to add two conditions!<br>
In return, the Commander swears to stay by U-556's side forever, to keep her company whenever she needs it!<br>
……<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Offer her your pinky.</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">U-556：</span><br>
Okay, it's a promise! No takebacks allowed!<br>
<br>
Upon sealing the promise with our pinkies, I felt a warmth begin to well up inside me.<br>
