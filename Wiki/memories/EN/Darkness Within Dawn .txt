<br>
Northern Parliament Base, Location Unknown<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Avrora：</span><br>
It's been a while, Pamiat' Merkuria. Your efforts have not gone unnoticed~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pamiat Merkuria：</span><br>
Oh, hey Avrora! I'm glad to be back!<br>
Ugh, I'm totally beat... But being able to move our plans forward is quite fulfilling.<br>
Will you be joining the upcoming operation as well?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Avrora：</span><br>
Certainly. Even I long to prove my worth on the battlefield every now and then, hehe.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pamiat Merkuria：</span><br>
Having that said... Isn't it weird that old-timers like us with our rickety rigging have to participate in such a dangerous operation?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Avrora：</span><br>
What was that about my age...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pamiat Merkuria：</span><br>
Err, that's not what I mean... Y'know, even if we've been modernized, our designs are what they are.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Avrora：</span><br>
A little modernization goes a long way. It's certainly better than nothing.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pamiat Merkuria：</span><br>
Well, yeah. I'm definitely stronger than I was before, even if I'm not some brand-new, completely different ship.<br>
Unlike usual retrofits, where certain rigging components are swapped out for new ones, this retrofit was more of a complete overhaul.<br>
For better or for worse, we've incorporated some pretty sketchy technology into our riggings.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Avrora：</span><br>
Speaking of retrofits, the other factions have been pursuing similar projects, have they not?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pamiat Merkuria：</span><br>
Yeah... Seems like the tech made its way around the other major factions a while ago.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Avrora：</span><br>
That may well be the case, but we seem to have gotten left out of the loop. The technology they've given us is rather rudimentary.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pamiat Merkuria：</span><br>
Well, we've found our own ways by now, right? After we explored the Arctic Stronghold and the Arcana Sanctum~<br>
But, whether or not we incorporate that technology depends on the higher-ups, as well as the compatibility of our riggings.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Avrora：</span><br>
So you were one of the lucky ones, huh? I guess I'll be counting on you to protect little ol' me~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pamiat Merkuria：</span><br>
Stop being such a tease! You're stronger than me anyway!<br>
After all, during the last Great War, you were the only reason the Azur Lane––<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Avrora：</span><br>
You're not about to just casually spill our most closely-kept secret, are you?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pamiat Merkuria：</span><br>
Fiiiiine, though I don't see why it matters since there's nobody else around... Well, let's move on then!<br>
Besides, it's not like I know the details either. When'd you find out about the Cubes anyway?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Avrora：</span><br>
Who knows? When it comes to knowledge and intel, more isn't always better.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pamiat Merkuria：</span><br>
You really don't plan on telling me anything, huh? Well, fine, I didn't want to know anyway!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Avrora：</span><br>
Mm, that's better. We're about to get to business soon anyway~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Communicator：</span><br>
Beep––––<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
Good day, comrades. I assume that after reading the contents of our next operation, some doubts may linger on your mind.<br>
Due to the importance of the situation, some details could not be adequately put down into text, hence the purpose of this call. If you have any questions, feel free to ask me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pamiat Merkuria：</span><br>
Ooh, pick me!<br>
So according to the operation packet, we're supposedly carrying out a raid on a Siren facility in Iron Blood-controlled waters.<br>
Now that the ceasefire agreement has been signed over the situation in the NA Ocean, wouldn't this operation land us in hot water?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
That is not a concern. Few people know about this hidden Siren facility. Should a firefight break out, your activities would be covered up by the Mirror Sea itself.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pamiat Merkuria：</span><br>
Alright... If that's the case, how do we know so much about this facility?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
Let's just say, we have a trustworthy informant.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pamiat Merkuria：</span><br>
Huh... I wonder who that could be...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
Besides, countermeasures against the Siren menace are a common goal shared across all factions. Even should we be found out, we have plausible deniability.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pamiat Merkuria：</span><br>
That makes sense. I'll leave the complicated political stuff to you then, Soyuz.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
Haha, that was the plan to begin with. Just keep your wits about you, and there shouldn't be any problems.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pamiat Merkuria：</span><br>
All right, will do!<br>
Right, I've got another question. If we're attacking a Siren facility, will we have enough firepower with just me and Avrora?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
The Siren activity in that area has all but ceased now. There won't be a battle.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pamiat Merkuria：</span><br>
Did you also learn this from your trustworthy informant?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
Yes, and you can trust this information.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pamiat Merkuria：</span><br>
Hmm... Well, that's good enough for me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Avrora：</span><br>
Soyuz, I've seen a "retrieval target" mentioned in this operation packet, but nothing about what it specifically is.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
Frankly... We don't know exactly what "it" is either.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Avrora：</span><br>
...You don't know? What do you mean by that?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
For the lack of a better description, it is something not bound by the laws of this world. By definition, we won't know of its nature until we see it.<br>
That's where you come in. If you find anything that might fit that description, whatever it may be, retrieve it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Avrora：</span><br>
A quest for unobtanium, huh? Reeks of a fool's errand to me, if I may be honest.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
Unfortunately, that's the best information we're going to get. We have neither the time nor luxury to conduct a thorough investigation beforehand.<br>
Now that the defenses in the Iron Blood-controlled areas are thin and the Sirens are reeling from their defeat in the NA Ocean, this is our best time to strike.<br>
I can't stress enough the importance of this mission. That's why I've entrusted this operation to you and Pamiat'.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Avrora：</span><br>
Very well. We'll get you your results.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
Good luck. I'll be ending the communication then.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pamiat Merkuria：</span><br>
I don't think I've ever seen Soyuz look unsure of herself before. Guess there's a first for everything.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Avrora：</span><br>
...Unsure, huh.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pamiat Merkuria：</span><br>
What's the matter, Avrora?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Avrora：</span><br>
Oh, it's nothing. I was thinking the same thing as you.<br>
(How long has it been since I last saw her make that expression? ...We'd better prepare for all contingencies.)<br>

<br>
Near the Siren Facility<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pamiat Merkuria：</span><br>
Looks like the intel we got was accurate - there's hardly been a peep from the Sirens here! That "trustworthy informant" sure is something else!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Avrora：</span><br>
I'm glad to see you in high spirits today, Pamiat'~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pamiat Merkuria：</span><br>
Naw, it's just another normal day for me! Though, I guess seeing all this is like a walk through memory lane?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Avrora：</span><br>
Hm? From back when you fought with the Iron Blood?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pamiat Merkuria：</span><br>
Mm, well, I guess so. Even back then, the Iron Blood was... how do I put it...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Avrora：</span><br>
Mavericks? Always saw the world a bit differently from the other factions.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pamiat Merkuria：</span><br>
Yeah, yeah! You've got a way with words, you know~<br>
Back when the Sirens appeared, the Iron Blood was the only one of the four major factions that just charged headlong into the unknown foe.<br>
And they sustained heavy losses because of it. After that, the major factions came together and fought under the banner of the Azur Lane.<br>
I suppose I don't need to speak too much about them forming the Crimson Axis and turning against us after that––<br>
Outside of their Reenactments, they'll still work with us to fight against the Sirens––<br>
But at the same time, I can't make any sense of their decisions at all. Like, why they attacked Scapa Flow.<br>
I was just thinking, is the enemy of our enemy really a friend? It's really frustrating to think about. We didn't understand them back then, and we still don't understand them now.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Avrora：</span><br>
The strings that hold our alliances together are thin and fragile indeed. They may snap, or weave into different forms altogether.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pamiat Merkuria：</span><br>
You get what I'm saying, right?<br>
Some of the comrades I fought with back then have retired. Others have been sunk, decommissioned, or scrapped. It seems like fewer and fewer of us remember the feeling of fighting together.<br>
Those who came later... Know only of a world where the Azur Lane has fractured.<br>
I sometimes wonder if we're being manipulated. Can we really come together again to defeat the Sirens for good? ...Avrora?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Avrora：</span><br>
I'm not sure. But, as long as we come together, it doesn't matter if we're a mixture or a solution as long as we work towards the same goal.<br>
Even if we live in a fractured world, there is hope as long as we can put aside our differences.<br>
Conversely, if we come together but everyone has their separate motives––<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pamiat Merkuria：</span><br>
...What are you trying to imply?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Avrora：</span><br>
Oh, nothing at all~<br>
As far as I'm concerned, we don't need to worry about the complicated stuff and just do what we believe to be right – and everything will be okay.<br>
...Oh my.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pamiat Merkuria：</span><br>
Avrora?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Avrora：</span><br>
The "Mikoyan"... The icebreaker belonging to the Polar Expedition Fleet...<br>
<br>
For whatever reason, a huge gantry crane was sticking out of the water in the middle of the area surrounded by Siren ruins.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pamiat Merkuria：</span><br>
It's that ship! What in the world is it doing here?<br>
This has to be the ship that disappeared during the Polar expedition a long time ago, right?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Avrora：</span><br>
I have no idea why it's here either, but... the reality is right in front of us.<br>
Soyuz did mention for us to keep an eye out for things "not bound by the laws of this world." I'd say that this ship appearing here would count as that.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pamiat Merkuria：</span><br>
Weird... It doesn't seem to have taken much damage from battle either...<br>
Oh! Do you think the Sirens got their tentacles on it?<br>
That's strange, isn't it? The ship that went missing all that time ago somehow showed up again over here...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Avrora：</span><br>
We can't just leave it here. There might be important data stored on its sensors and equipment.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pamiat Merkuria：</span><br>
So, what's the plan?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Avrora：</span><br>
Sorry, I got a bit excited there. Hmm... Let's deploy our mass-produced ships and tow it back into our territory first.<br>
After that, we need to investigate it thoroughly before the higher-ups get their hands on it!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pamiat Merkuria：</span><br>
Sounds good to me! We need to find out what happened during that operation!<br>
All right, Mikoyan, it's time to come home!<br>
{{折叠面板|内容结束}}

{{折叠面板|标题=Failed Expedition|选项=3|主框=1|样式=primary|展开=是}}
<br>
The icebreaker, escorted by Pamiat' Merkuria and Avrora, was safely brought back to one of the Northern Parliament's ports.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Avrora：</span><br>
Pamiat', how much do you know about that "failed" Polar Expedition?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pamiat Merkuria：</span><br>
Probably nothing that you don't already know. Even after all our hard work, we went home empty-handed.<br>
If I remember, that was around the time the Crown first appeared. We were so confident that we'd be able to push deeper into the Polar region's unknown depths with our new powers.<br>
Things seemed to be going so well, but before I knew it, the Mikoyan had disappeared, along with all the research outposts we had set up.<br>
Just like that, we lost everything. The fleet, the experimental submarine, even the massive base and outposts we had.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Avrora：</span><br>
Indeed... There's a bit more to it from my end though.<br>
At first, all the communications we were receiving from the base were normal. Then suddenly, we got a distress signal.<br>
But when we tracked down the signal, we couldn't find any trace of the ship that had sent it. No signs of movement, no wreckage, nothing.<br>
By the time we got there, all we saw was an empty sea of ice.<br>
We searched around, but couldn't find any traces of the base.<br>
Eventually, the search was called off and the operation was deemed a failure.<br>
Of course, we suspected the possibility of a Mirror Sea and assembled several fleets to search the area near the operation site.<br>
Even Soyuz herself joined the search efforts, but to no avail.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pamiat Merkuria：</span><br>
And that was the first time you ever saw Soyuz lose her cool, huh? It's crazy that something like that happened...<br>
But, I think I can understand how she felt. She personally saw that fleet off too, didn't she?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Avrora：</span><br>
Yes... It must've been a serious blow for her...<br>
After that, between the Singularity and the Arctic Stronghold, their persistent attacks thinned out our resources. We were never able to conduct a follow-up expedition.<br>
Since then, that expedition has remained buried under a mountain of documents as a "failed" operation. Only recently has it been dug back out.<br>
After replaying the situation again and again, the only plausible explanation I could come up with is – the actual location of the base might not have been where we thought it to be.<br>
The base, as well as the Mikoyan, must have traveled through a Mirror Sea and "moved" to another location.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pamiat Merkuria：</span><br>
So, in other words, our base might've been built on top of a Mirror Sea site from the very beginning?<br>
Yeah, that does make sense! Anomalies can occur inside a Mirror Sea even in the absence of Sirens, and...<br>
The fact that we found the Mikoyan at a Siren facility supports that hypothesis!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Avrora：</span><br>
Right, and I have one other piece of evidence.<br>
The SOS signal we received in the first place might've been fake.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pamiat Merkuria：</span><br>
Fake?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Avrora：</span><br>
During the time of the Arcana Sanctum exploration, we received some information from Belorussiya and the Commander regarding the Sirens' transmission frequency.<br>
After we repaired the radar, we started receiving a mysterious ping from an unknown location.<br>
At first, we wrote it off as background noise, but one day, we realized that it was actually an encrypted communication with a deactivated password.<br>
The contents read, "We are under attack, requesting support immediately," which matched up perfectly with the SOS signal we responded to.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pamiat Merkuria：</span><br>
Wait a minute, doesn't that mean that whatever device sending the junk signal is still in operation somewhere?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Avrora：</span><br>
Yes, and we reached the same conclusion as well. The appearance of the Mikoyan here may well confirm our suspicions.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pamiat Merkuria：</span><br>
Ugh... That seems way too convenient, almost like someone WANTED us to find it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Avrora：</span><br>
I agree. In any case, Soyuz seemed to have some inkling about all these things happening. We were just sent to retrieve the proof.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pamiat Merkuria：</span><br>
Whoever our "trustworthy informant" is must be really formidable.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Avrora：</span><br>
Yeah... And hopefully we'll learn more once the analysis on the Mikoyan finishes running.<br>
If we're lucky, we might even find out about that base's disappearance.<br>
Even if this is a trap, we must find out how it works in order to secure the safety of our waters.<br>
(And in all likelihood, what Soyuz truly wants to know––)<br>

<br>
Somewhere in the Northern Parliament<br>
Inside a dimly-lit room, Sovetsky Soyuz repeatedly looked over the report from Avrora and Pamiat'.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
The Mikoyan, huh...<br>
An unexpectedly major find.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">???：</span><br>
Indeed. I'm glad to see that you're pleased with our "work."<br>
<br>
A robotic-sounding female voice came out of a communicator that had been planted somewhere without anyone's knowledge.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">???：</span><br>
Treat this as compensation for the losses incurred during the previous "incident," and for our continued cooperation.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
Where are they...?<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">???：</span><br>
Unfortunately, I didn't have time to collect that information.<br>
If you want to find out what happened, you'll have to do the rest of the work yourself.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
I see. It must've been difficult for you to procure this.<br>
However, this "compensation" won't be enough. Information alone won't satisfy me.<br>
Prolonged loss of our shipping routes. Constant encroachment into our territory.<br>
As long as the Naval HQ does not cease their actions, an agreement between ships only carries so much weight.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">???：</span><br>
Soyuz, you won't get anything out of guilt-tripping me.<br>
But, there is something we can do. Not through Reenactments, but through our power. And the Commander's power.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
Yes. As you know, "Reenactments" will only lead to the Iron Blood's ruin.<br>
There is no future for that Iron Blood. One built on Bismarck's power––<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">???：</span><br>
Bismarck? Are you taunting me, or praising me?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
Take it as praise. Bismarck was a respectable leader, and the two of us shared the will and vision to create change.<br>
<span style="color:#ffd000;">???：</span><br>
...Then, I trust we will be able to continue our fruitful relationship, Soyuz.<br>
With the final "Key" retrieved from the Arcana Sanctum and the Commander's power, the Northern Parliament will also be freed from the shackles of the past.<br>
Let us both move towards a new future. Hehe.<br>
<br>
After the communication ended, Soyuz remained silent for a few seconds... then dozens of seconds.<br>
Regret. Defeat. Accomplishment. Hope. And the future –– A number of words coalesced into a storm of chaotic emotions.<br>
In that silent space, she sifted through the chaos, ordering it with her icy will and rationality, unifying that which had branched.<br>
...The time had come. Opening up a dedicated line of communication, Soyuz began to send a new message––<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
...Based on the information and physical evidence obtained from the Siren facility, we believe that the Polar Expedition Fleet is likely to be alive.<br>
...Therefore, from the perspective of retrieving Siren technology as well as providing relief efforts, our fleet proposes the following operation in consideration of our current strength:<br>
"Form a rescue team, rescue the Polar expedition fleet, and collect information and materials related to the Sirens."<br>
"Let the responsibility for the tasks aforementioned fall upon Sovetsky Soyuz."<br>
