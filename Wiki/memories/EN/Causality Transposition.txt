1 The Test Subject<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB：</span><br>
Status report: Recording equipment activated.<br>
Commander, please provide your feedback on the fidelity of the replication environment after the conclusion of the 35th algorithm iteration.<br>
<br>
"Everything is almost lifelike, from my desk, to the bookshelves, curtains, carpets, and couch. Could almost fool me into thinking I'm back at the port."<br>
"Considering how the first iteration could barely get the geometric shapes right, this tech's improving at a remarkable rate."<br>
"Can you tell me how precisely this iteration replicated the environment?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB：</span><br>
Query received. Your feedback has been recorded.<br>
Just as in the 34th iteration, only 59.43% of your memory was able to be analyzed.<br>
However, the adjusted algorithm now incorporates visual and field data of your office in addition to the imagery from your memory.<br>
<br>
The Sea of Stars – code name for a confidential Eagle Union research facility.<br>
Here, experiments were underway to "manifest" human imagination into reality.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB：</span><br>
In short, this environment cannot be replicated from your own imagination or reconstructed data alone. It must have both.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："Let's continue the experiment."</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2："I'll try imagining it more vividly this time."</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB：</span><br>
Orders received. Unlocking mental stabilization framework.<br>
Commander, please imagine yourself at work in your office. Let it overlap with the replicated environment around you.<br>
<br>
The prevailing view of Wisdom Cubes, the very core of the shipgirls' existence, is that they can give form to the thoughts and feelings of humans.<br>
However, the exact nature of this process is not well understood. Research into this matter is shrouded in mystery, and almost always kept strictly confidential.<br>
I was quite surprised when TB invited me to be a part of this experiment. Apparently, my resonance with Wisdom Cubes made me an ideal candidate.<br>
After many rounds of attempting to recreate my office from my memory, I was even able to casually "manifest" the unread reports sitting on my desk.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB：</span><br>
Replication results confirmed. Analyzing data.<br>
<br>
"Did you get any more usable data out of this iteration?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB：</span><br>
Analysis indicates that the replicated report contains information from the newspaper you read yesterday. Unfortunately, 40.57% of the data remains unreadable.<br>
We will be unable to draw conclusions on the cause of this phenomenon until the next stage of our research.<br>
<br>
Despite these occasional roadblocks, knowing that the research was progressing made me feel better.<br>
I'm reminded of when Memphis first described these experiments to me–<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Ahem... You could kind of compare it to lucid dreaming, I guess.<br>
First, it reads your brainwaves and analyzes what you're imagining in the form of data. Then, it feeds it back to you in a kind of lucid dream.<br>
That's what this device, the Reality Lens, is meant to do. Actually, that's the point of all of this research.<br>
That doesn't mean it can read ALL of your brain waves, though. It's limited to what you're consciously envisioning.<br>
It would make a whole bunch of garbled noise if it reflected everything that came to mind. Plus, it'd be awful if you thought of something dirty or traumatizing and it popped right out into reality.<br>
So TB has set up a filter to block anything that might cause stress or make you go insane if you see it.<br>
I know I said all that, but don't stress about it! These experiments are just meant to optimize the Reality Lens algorithm, so it's all good as long as you just follow her instructions.<br>
Don't just assume she can block everything, though. Umm... Basically, just be careful, and don't focus on anything unrelated to the experiment.<br>
All of these experiments are vital to the progress of our operation, after all.<br>
Phew... That about explains it, I think. We're counting on you, Commander.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB：</span><br>
Question: For what purpose have you replicated the shipgirl Memphis?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
............<br>
<br>
"Whoops. There I go, letting my mind wander and imagining things into existence."<br>
I'll have to practice using the Reality Lens a lot more before the next stage of research.<br>

2 Refracted Light<br>
Sea of Stars Headquarters - Provisional Office, Sector B-20 "Pyxis Nautica"<br>
On top of the desk is a report from the Research Department.<br>
Not too far away, Memphis is explaining the contents of that very report.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
"...The mental states of the PR blueprint ships should gradually mature and stabilize over time after a period of interacting with the Commander."<br>
"However, the peculiarities within the blueprint ships' hulls make this process non-linear, with some cases in which this relationship is not very evident at all."<br>
"For example, some aspects of Anchorage's personality cannot be explained through psychological analysis. Some of the information elements that compose her hull display some irregular discrete patterns."<br>
"Such phenomena have been observed in other blueprint shipgirls, but typically, contact with the Commander combined with the passage of time will typically work in tandem to reinforce the hull, eliminating these irregularities."<br>
"Analysis of these information elements will be vital in order to understand her identity and understanding of others."<br>
Sorry for all the big words, but basically, that's their view of it.<br>
Umm, to put it more simply...<br>
The reason why Anchorage calls you "Teacher" might have something to do with the peculiarities of her hull. We don't know if she even perceives you to be her "Commander."<br>
<br>
From what we've observed in the past, when blueprint ships are first brought into being, a large amount of observable but undecipherable information blocks appear in their hulls.<br>
One of the Sea of Stars' research objectives was to analyze the contents of these information blocks, but they quickly merge and reorganize as their minds stabilize.<br>
But, Anchorage seems to be different. Despite having "stabilized," she still exhibits these anomalies.<br>
What exactly are these anomalies... and why are they unique to Anchorage?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："Is Anchorage in danger?"</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2："I'm worried about Anchorage."</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''The Research Department doesn't seem to think so. We see all kinds of unexplainable things on the bleeding edge of scientific research.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''As for Anchorage specifically, everyone at the Sea of Stars has been monitoring her closely.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''I checked in on her on my way here, and nothing seemed off about her. She looked like she was doing just fine.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Honestly, I don't think that girl has any idea what this place is or what we're worried about.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''There's no reason to be. She's doing perfectly fine.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Everyone at the Sea of Stars has been monitoring her closely.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''I checked in on her on my way here, and nothing seemed off about her. She looked like she was doing just fine.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''"Given what happened with Hood, I can only hope there's nothing wrong with Anchorage."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''She's fine. Honestly, I don't think that girl has any idea what this place is or what we're worried about.<br>
<br>
"You're probably right. I didn't notice anything wrong with her at all before."<br>
The Sea of Stars has equipment, TB, and plenty of people who can help. I had to admit, this was the best chance we were going to get to study these anomalies.<br>
The information we stand to learn from this experiment could potentially bring benefit to the entire world.<br>
"But, how do we approach this problem?"<br>
I thought about the many experiments I'd seen here in the Sea of Stars and compared them to our current problem.<br>
"...I have an idea."<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："TB, what's the status of the Reality Lens project?"</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB：</span><br>
Query received. Retrieving status information regarding the Reality Lens.<br>
<br>
"With the power of Wisdom Cube technology, the Reality Lens can materialize the images of people in a form similar to lucid dreams."<br>
"If we can focus all of her scattered discrete information elements into a single point, we might be able to work with that."<br>
"But there's one problem. We don't know if we can even use the Reality Lens on shipgirls, do we?"<br>
"It would defeat the point entirely if I dragged Anchorage into a dangerous situation through this."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB：</span><br>
Proposal: Commander, it is possible for you to use the Reality Lens and connect to Anchorage's hull.<br>
However, this process is untested due to complications in the research phase. Adjustments to the algorithm will be necessary before it can be used in the Sea of Stars prototype.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Wait, Commander. Are you serious?<br>
<br>
"I don't see the problem. Why the concerned look?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
TB just said the process is untested, right? This is obviously a bad idea!<br>
Sure, it's our fault for not being able to make serious progress, even if we had to wait for you to utilize your Wisdom Cube resonance.<br>
But aren't we clearly jumping the gun here? I mean, take it from someone who knows what she's talking about.<br>
The algorithm itself has seen a lot of progress, but I think it's too early to try connecting it to a shipgirl's hull.<br>
<br>
"Now that you mention it…"<br>
"You're right. If the Reality Lens could have helped analyze her, then it would've been proposed in the report."<br>
"But we don't have any other ideas, and we don't have all the time in the world."<br>
"I think our only course of action is to devote all of the Sea of Stars' resources to improving the experiment's algorithm. Make it the top priority."<br>
"Leave budgetary concerns to me. I'll call some people who can help with that."<br>
"Do whatever you can to get the Reality Lens to the next stage of research."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
If you're willing to go that far, Commander, I have no objections.<br>
But listen. With or without your help, Wisdom Cube research is gonna take time.<br>
You have to be the one to use it, too, so doesn't matter how early it's ready if you're not there to operate the Reality Lens.<br>
I know you're a busy person, but be ready to clear your schedule, okay?<br>
<br>
"Of course. That's a small price for helping a friend."<br>
"Speaking of, we ought to go check up on Anchorage once work clears up a bit."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Phew... Okay, next report. This one's about the pseudo-environment simulation project…<br>

3 Moment of Truth<br>
After fifty iterations of the algorithm, we finally managed to stabilize the Reality Lens.<br>
It was about time for the next stage of our research: identifying the anomalous information elements in Anchorage's hull.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vestal：</span><br>
Commander... Um, are you sure about this?<br>
Testing would be one thing, but we'll be connecting the Reality Lens to a shipgirl's cognition without a test run.<br>
And once the connection starts, your consciousness will be stuck inside a "dream" until it's over...<br>
The Sea of Stars' technology may be advanced, but there are no guarantees that we won't run into any accidents...<br>
Worse, we don't know what might happen when you interact with Anchorage's "anomalies."<br>
Frankly, I can't even promise that our emergency protocols are enough to handle the worst-case scenarios...<br>
Speaking from a professional's perspective, I'm still opposed to you doing this.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Same here. Can't we at least wait until we have a bit more data on how this thing works?<br>
<br>
"I understand everyone's concerns."<br>
"We could give the algorithm more time to be perfected, sure, but that doesn't mean waiting will solve all of our problems."<br>
"I know by now the risks involved in using the Reality Lens."<br>
"And I also know that these risks can't be eliminated that easily."<br>
"It could take years before we feel 'ready.' I say we do it now instead of waiting."<br>
"Do you remember Bismarck's Cube? We don't know what effects hull anomalies might have on a shipgirl, but we do know how serious they can be.<br>
"And most of all, I can't spend my whole life waiting here in the Sea of Stars."<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："Now is our only chance."</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2："We can't keep waiting any longer."</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Think so? Well, you're the boss. I'll start final checks on the Reality Lens now.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vestal：</span><br>
I'll call Helena and the others, too. We also have final checks we should perform on our backup plan.<br>
Even if things take a turn for the worse, I swear that we will protect you and Anchorage, Commander!<br>

4 Lucid Dreaming<br>
My vision was blanketed in darkness. Not a sound reaches my ears.<br>
Rather than being inside that facility, I felt like I had been sucked into a black hole.<br>
This was perfectly consistent with the operation of the Reality Lens, but given the magnitude of my job, I couldn't help but to tense up.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB：</span><br>
Commander, I've noticed that your heart rate is rising. Do you require medical attention?<br>
<br>
My thoughts had already started influencing my physiology. The Reality Lens technology is not to be taken lightly...<br>
So, I took a deep breath and tried to relax.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB：</span><br>
Heart rate stabilization confirmed.<br>
Now summarizing the details of the experiment: After connecting to Anchorage's hull, you will contact her through the simulated environment.<br>
After that, you are to follow my guidance carefully.<br>
Throughout the operation, I will monitor you and remain in constant communication in order to keep you and Anchorage safe.<br>
<br>
"I authorize the activation of the Reality Lens."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB：</span><br>
Orders received. Activating Reality Lens.<br>
<br>
The large facility rumbled to life, and an indescribable lightness began to pervade my body.<br>
The sensation of simultaneous boundlessness and helplessness was akin to being thrown into outer space without a ship.<br>
But before loneliness and a sense of loneliness could creep into my mind, the space I perceived around me rapidly condensed, turning from vast and infinite into a single defined space.<br>
As my consciousness refocused as well, I opened my eyes–<br>
And what I saw was a classroom, brightly lit by the setting sun.<br>
I found myself standing at the podium, a great number of desks and chairs neatly arranged in front of me.<br>
In the closest seat to the podium was a girl, her head tucked in her arms as she napped face-down on the desk.<br>
Eagle Union blueprint shipgirl Anchorage was here; I didn't even have to visualize her.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB：</span><br>
Connection complete. Please wait while the verification sequence is executed.<br>
Connection status normal... Resource domain secure... Deviations minor.<br>
Beginning connection test. Commander, are my transmissions coming through clearly?<br>
<br>
"I hear you loud and clear. Seems like everything's working fine so far."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB：</span><br>
Feedback received, Commander. Connection status normal. Algorithm iteration complete.<br>
Requesting authorization to set Plan A as the recommended course of action.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："Authorized."</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB：</span><br>
Orders received. Commander, please awaken Anchorage. Through conversation, try to find the anomaly in her simulated environment.<br>
In the meantime, I will both use the information received from her hull connection to stabilize the environment and analyze any information yielded by your conversation.<br>
<br>
"Right. I'll stick to the plan."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB：</span><br>
Orders confirmed. Picture books for you to read to Anchorage have been created.<br>
<br>
A few books I'd visualized in a previous experiment fell onto the podium.<br>
So I picked one up and slowly approached Anchorage.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Anchorage：</span><br>
Teacher...?<br>
*yaaaawn*... Teacher! Anchorage has been waiting for you!<br>
Teacher, Anchorage is so happy you came!<br>
<br>
"How about we read another fairy tale?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Anchorage：</span><br>
Fairy tales... Hooray!<br>
They're so fun, so happy... So dreamy... Anchorage loves fairy tales!<br>
Books are hard... Too hard for Anchorage.<br>
<br>
So she loves fairy tales, but she can't read them herself.<br>
"Okay, let's read this one. 'The Adventure of Fairy Tale Forest.'"<br>
"Once upon a time, there was a bunny named the Grey Rabbit who lived in a forest…"<br>
"...And they all lived happily ever after."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Anchorage：</span><br>
That last part was great! Anchorage loves this one!<br>
Teacher, you're so cool for reading stories to me!<br>
Anchorage brought you... a present!<br>
<br>
With a big smile, Anchorage pulled out her desk's drawer and took out a crayon drawing.<br>
Possibly a result of the Reality Lens's imprecision, I couldn't recognize what she'd drawn. But there were a few blobs that seemed to be human-like.<br>
Yet for some reason, some incomprehensible panic overtook me the instant I saw it.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："What in the world...?"</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Anchorage：</span><br>
Anchorage drew this picture for you, Teacher!<br>
Do you... like it...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB：</span><br>
Warning: Large quantities of unknown data observed.<br>
Warning: Data analysis function overloaded.<br>
Warning: Algorithm efficiency degraded.<br>
Connection status unstable.<br>
Confirmed overflow of unknown data. Sustainability of simulated environment greatly degraded.<br>
Proposal: Stop the experiment at once.<br>
<br>
"Try to withstand it a little longer!"<br>
......<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："Anchorage, who are the people in this drawing?"</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Anchorage：</span><br>
Anchorage drew you, Teacher. And your... Friends? People you know...?<br>
*yawn*... Mm... Anchorage is so sleepyyy...<br>
Teacher... Anchorage has stuff to tell you... in the dream world...<br>
<br>
Suddenly, Anchorage and the classroom were overwhelmed by a dazzling light.<br>
My field of vision was dyed pure white.<br>

"Anchorage? TB...?"<br>
"No dice, huh?"<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：......</span>'''''<br>
<br>
"I can still move. The Reality Lens must still be working."<br>
I figured everything had gone white because of the data overload from before, making it impossible to construct the simulation.<br>
"Guess I'll just look around."<br>
Suddenly, I spotted a door standing in the distance.<br>
Or... Was it standing? Since everything was white, it was hard to tell whether it was standing on the ground or floating.<br>
But then, I noticed Anchorage next to the door.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Anchorage：</span><br>
Teacher... You're here!<br>
<br>
"Where are we?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Anchorage：</span><br>
This is Anchorage's... Or, the Reality Lens's... dream? Let's go!<br>
Teacher, Anchorage wants to tell you a good story!<br>
<br>
"A dream? And you say it's yours or the Reality Lens'?"<br>
"Is that somehow different from the classroom we were just in?"<br>
"And what does it mean for the Reality Lens to dream, anyway...?"<br>
......<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："It's just beyond that door, right?"</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Anchorage：</span><br>
Yep! It's a really good story, Teacher!<br>
<br>
Anchorage pointed to the door and urged me to go in.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："Aren't you coming?"</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Anchorage：</span><br>
Anchorage can't...!<br>
It's Anchorage's first time... so Anchorage wants you to do it, Teacher!<br>
<br>
"I guess I have no choice."<br>
I steeled my resolve and headed through the door.<br>
The moment my hand touched it, a voice flowed into my mind.<br>
Well, it looks like you've finally started to piece together the puzzle of the shipgirls' hulls.<br>
It only matches my records by less than 1%, but this wavelength has to be yours.<br>
The fact that you're playing this recording is absolute proof that it's you.<br>
It also means that my very last gamble was successful.<br>
I know you. No matter when, where, or who you are…<br>
You could never abandon those girls.<br>
Making you the final failsafe was the right call.<br>
"What was that voice...?"<br>
<span style="color:#a020f0;">???：</span><br>
"No dice, huh?"<br>
<br>
In a barely-lit room, I spotted a woman wearing glasses.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："Who are you...?"</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2："Where am I...?"</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项3："What the...?"</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#a020f0;">???：</span><br>
Oh, calm down. I'm just a recording. Or, well... More precisely, an AI that can play recordings.<br>
I'll explain everything, so just be patient.<br>
You may be wondering who I am. If referring to my outward appearance alone, I would be known as Anzeel.<br>
But I suggest you call me Recorder.<br>
<span style="color:#a020f0;">Recorder：</span><br>
As for where we are, this is a pseudospace constructed from data.<br>
Specifically, it is a space made from the information found in the gaps of the metanetwork connecting Wisdom Cubes.<br>
But you wouldn't understand much of that, would you? Just consider this a place that can't be found by anyone else.<br>
Hmm... You did find me earlier than I'd expected, though.<br>
<br>
"Find you? Earlier than expected...?"<br>
<span style="color:#a020f0;">Recorder：</span><br>
Oh, how should I put this? It might be too soon for the "current" you.<br>
That you've found this place is like a... speedrun? Cheating through glitch abuse, perhaps?<br>
Not that it matters. Anzeel did often say that a bit of randomness isn't always a bad thing.<br>
By the way, did you get here through that Anchorage girl? Don't worry; she's going to be perfectly fine.<br>
The... irregular patterns of her discrete data have just made her a little weird, is all. It's not necessarily a bad thing.<br>
Now, what I can share with you depends on what records Anzeel left behind.<br>
Let's see. The recording I needed to play... Nnngh... Hah!<br>
Oh, that's bad. Ahhh, I've really done it now...<br>
There's just a bunch of fragmented emotional data here. I can't find a single piece of real information worth playing! Teehee☆<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："Uhh...?"</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2："So...?"</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#a020f0;">Recorder：</span><br>
So I guess Anzeel created this recorder... just because she wanted to meet you?<br>
No, this bit of sentimental data is far too vague. I don't think she'd do anything that simple...<br>
Could it be that... it was you who wanted to meet Anzeel one last time?<br>
Or was my appearance alone the true record that Anzeel wanted to leave for you?<br>
Like she wanted to say, "remember me – even if you're not you anymore."<br>
I don't know the details. After all... I'm just an AI who plays recordings!<br>
<br>
"No dice, huh?"<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："What is my relationship with Anzeel?"</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#a020f0;">Recorder：</span><br>
Can't answer that one. It's not in the records.<br>
We might be having a conversation, but in the end, I'm just a fancy AI.<br>
A program that can only follow the instructions given to it.<br>
Wait. Something's coming this way.<br>
Whatever it is, it's been following you for a while now.<br>
<br>
"...TB?"<br>
"Now that you mention it, I haven't heard anything from TB for a while despite us being connected before."<br>
"Is that because we're in a place that nobody can find?"<br>
<span style="color:#a020f0;">Recorder：</span><br>
.........<br>
Warning: Category V threat detected nearby. Commencing removal of AI and records per security protocol.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Anchorage：</span><br>
Teacher!<br>
Hurry... We need to run!<br>
<br>
Bright light blotted out everything once more. When I came to again, Anchorage was reaching out toward me from nearby.<br>
I rushed to take her hand, but before I could, intense dizziness overtook me.<br>
All of my brain cells cried out at once. It felt as if my faltering consciousness was being dragged straight out of my head.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Anchorage：</span><br>
Teacher! This is bad...! Nooo!<br>
<br>
"No dice, huh?"<br>
And my soul was once again thrown into an empty void.<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
This is insane! It's only been ten minutes since the Commander went in there! What kind of data...<br>
Wait. Is this because you're analyzing the stuff in Anchorage's hull?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB：</span><br>
It is reasonable to infer that the hull is the source of the unknown data.<br>
Beginning backup plan F: mounting computing resources and additional memory for the Reality Lens.<br>
Proceeding with algorithm...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Helena, it's dangerous for the Commander to stay there. Move some of the unknown data to another Sea of Stars project!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
Okay! I'll do it right away...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB：</span><br>
Completed mounting computing resources and additional memory.<br>
Warning: Unknown data overflow confirmed. Reality Lens will exceed mounted memory capacity in 30 seconds.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Again?! What the heck is going on here?!<br>
This thing could simulate an entire city during the experiments. Is whatever's going on in there even bigger than that...?<br>
Helena, how's the analysis?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
It looks bad here, too! It's overwhelming our processing capabilities!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vestal：</span><br>
Memphis! We mustn't continue to put the Commander in harm's way!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
I know that, okay?!<br>
TB, stop the whole experiment! Cut off the connection to the hull!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB：</span><br>
The Commander has ordered me to try to withstand it. The experiment will continue until processing reaches its limit.<br>
Temporal regulator efficiency degraded to 25%. The passage of time is now sixty times faster within the Reality Lens.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
So you mean... It's only been like a minute out here, but...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vestal：</span><br>
In the Commander's mind, it's been an entire hour?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB：</span><br>
Temporal regulator has failed.<br>
I am no longer able to monitor the Commander's vitals. Attempts to communicate have also failed.<br>
Temporarily halting Sea of Stars projects below priority 3 and reallocating resources to the Reality Lens, per backup plan F.<br>
Based on the current rate of data overflow, this secures approximately 90 seconds of operation.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Vestal：</span><br>
This is awful! If we don't stop the data, it'll just keep growing!<br>
And the more time passes, the more the Commander's perception of time speeds up. At this rate, the Commander's brain is going to get fried!<br>
...Our only choice is to declare an emergency in the Sea of Stars.<br>
If we allocate every last resource to the Reality Lens, TB should be able to recover the temporal regulator.<br>
Once things recover to the point that we can cut off the connection, we should save them right away!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
I guess... that's all we can do, huh? We'll have to use the last resort the Commander and Saratoga left for us.<br>
Objections, Helena?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
N-no, ma'am!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
TB, take us into crisis mode. Reallocate all resources that aren't devoted to life support and security.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB：</span><br>
Orders received. Please enter the access code to the tower.<br>

Attention. This is the Sea of Stars host, Navigator TB.<br>
Crisis Protocol ECP-15 has begun. The Sea of Stars will now shift into crisis procedures.<br>
In 10 minutes, the core of the facility will be locked down. In 30 minutes, so will the remainder of the facility.<br>
Cancellation window has passed. Crisis procedures can no longer be aborted.<br>

Repeating. All present within the facility, please move to the designated evacuation area at once.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Memphis：</span><br>
Well, I guess this is where it really begins...<br>
I'll monitor the Commander. Vestal, you take care of Anchorage. Helena, the temporal regulator is all yours!<br>
We don't have much time. We have to save the Commander and Anchorage!<br>

7 Omnipresent Eye<br>
I had a nightmare.<br>
I could feel myself being watched by a blurry figure.<br>
As soon as I tried to focus my attention on it, it would disappear.<br>
But the moment my concentration lapsed in the slightest, it would reappear.<br>
It just stood there like a ghastly sculpture, not moving, not making a sound.<br>
An alarm...? Did something happen in the Sea of Stars?<br>
No... I'm still dreaming... But it's not the same dream as before.<br>
I tried directing my consciousness around. Whatever it was that had been watching me before is no longer present.<br>
A wave of relief washed over me, as the nightmare's icy grip receded.<br>
Alarms continued to ring in my ears, but it didn't matter anymore...<br>
<span style="color:#ff9900;">Helena META：</span><br>
You're not safe yet, Commander.<br>
Don't fall asleep here. The enemy is coming.<br>
Wake up, Commander. Wake up...<br>
<br>
*gasp*... *gasp*…<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
Thank goodness... You finally woke up, Commander…<br>
You kept tossing and turning with a terrified look on your face... I was just about to call Memphis over…<br>
<br>
After last night's experiment, I collapsed into bed and fell right to sleep... But what just happened?<br>
"Helena, what time is it?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
Um, well, the clock says 1616.<br>
<br>
"Four in the afternoon?! How long did I stay asleep for?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
Um... That seems unusual to me as well. Based on my subjective sense of time, it should be no later than three or four in the morning.<br>
But, all the clocks in the Sea of Stars seem to say that it, in fact, is 1616.<br>
TB has also informed us that a large, unidentified object is making its way towards us.<br>
<br>
"A large object...? I thought the Sea of Stars' location was strictly confidential."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
Yes, the entire base has been elevated to red alert.<br>
In half an hour, we'll seal the entrance and cloak the entire facility, but we can't guarantee the safety of everyone inside.<br>
Fortunately, we still have twenty-five more minutes. Commander, let's leave together.<br>
<br>
"What about the other girls?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
Everyone around the perimeter has already evacuated. Those deeper inside the facility will evacuate after finishing their necessary work.<br>
<br>
"So, what do we do about TB?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Helena：</span><br>
Unfortunately, TB will not be able to leave... because this place is her mainframe…<br>
We're running out of time, Commander. Let's get out of here, okay?<br>
<br>
.........<br>
I can't help but feel like I'm forgetting something important. What happened here…?<br>
