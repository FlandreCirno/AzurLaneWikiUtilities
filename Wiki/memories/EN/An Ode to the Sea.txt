1 Another Day, Another Prank<br>
(knock knock)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
Oh, that's gotta be Lex!<br>
Which means I'd better skedaddle now. Remember: play along, Commander!<br>
<br>
Outside my open window, Saratoga's voice fades into the distance.<br>
She rigged my door with some kind of contraption before she left. I wonder what that's about.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lexington：</span><br>
Commander, was that Sara I just– Aahh!<br>
Seems I got my answer. She was here indeed...<br>
<br>
Lexington set off the contraption, showering her in colorful party ribbons. They make her look like an ornate Christmas tree.<br>
It's a warm welcome in Saratoga's book of mischief.<br>
......<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："Need a hand?"</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2："I'll get the blow dryer."</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lexington：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Thanks, but I'll be fine.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Oh, you have a blow dryer ready? Okay, then on second thought, by all means.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lexington：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Please do. Sara's pranks must be relentless for you to keep a blow dryer lying around the office...<br>
<br>
After a few long minutes, I finally manage to dig Lexington out from the mound of ribbons.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lexington：</span><br>
I understand her love for pranks. I just wish they weren't always so excessive...<br>
You'll have to forgive her for this mess, Commander. I'll clean it up at once.<br>
...Hm? Are you sure?<br>
So she set this prank up for me, not for you... I see.<br>
Knowing her, she must've thought I'm bummed out and she wanted to cheer me up. She worries too much.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："Changing subjects... How about tea later this afternoon?"</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lexington：</span><br>
Why the sudden invitation? Don't tell me you're worried about me as well. Nothing's wrong, honestly.<br>
...You insist that I come? Well, I've never tried your tea before, so...<br>
Alright, we'll have tea later.<br>

2 Tea and Personal Problems<br>
Office - Balcony<br>
A parasol, a table, and two chairs. Everything is set for our little tea party... yet something feels out of the ordinary today.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lexington：</span><br>
Thanks, Commander.<br>
Mmh, it smells lovely. You've practiced tea-making, haven't you?<br>
<br>
"Now and then, in my spare time. Say, have you ever wanted to swap roles with Saratoga? As in, be the little sister instead?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lexington：</span><br>
Be the little sister? Did she tell you to ask that?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："No, I'm just curious."</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2："Is it that obvious?"</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lexington：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Hmm... I have wondered what it's like to be the younger one, yes.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lexington：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''She's not known for being subtle, is she?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lexington：</span><br>
To answer your question, I'm happy being everyone's big sister figure.<br>
Besides, you can't pick if you're the big or little sister. It's something you're born as.<br>
<br>
"True. It was a silly question. I just thought it might take your mind off things."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lexington：</span><br>
Heehee. Well, we may not be related, but I see you as my own little sibling.<br>
......<br>
I suppose I can always pretend. Pretend not to be everyone's big sister.<br>
Listen, something's been bothering me for a while... Will you hear me out?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："Of course."</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lexington：</span><br>
I'm... I'm planning my next concert, and I don't know what kind of performance it should be.<br>
"Can't you use statistics and focus groups?" you may ask, and yes, I can. They're an easy way to figure out audience expectations.<br>
But I don't want to base everything on numbers, or I feel like it'll cease to be my concert, my music.<br>
The crowds might love it, but I agree with Sara: there's no soul in it.<br>
That's when it hit me. Without knowing it, I've been treating my concerts as a means to gather data, rather than a way to bring joy to people.<br>
And in the process, I've squandered the hard work people put into making my concerts happen.<br>
<br>
This problem of hers is very specific, but I understand why it bothers her. Being an idol is more than a job to her.<br>
Luckily, I know someone who can do the number-crunching for her. It would also do her some good to take a day off and clear her mind.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：(Tell her you have an idea.)</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lexington：</span><br>
You think that'll solve it? Hmm... If it doesn't work out, at least we'll spend a day together.<br>
Let's give it a try. I knew I could count on you, Commander~<br>

3 Data Isn't Everything<br>
Port - Princeton's Room<br>
After a moment's hesitation, Lexington knocks on the door leading to a quiet room.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Princeton ：</span><br>
Come in. I wasn't expecting visitors today, so I don't have– Oh! Commander and Lexington! Hi there.<br>
Don't see you two together every day... Uhh, my room's a bit of a mess. Please try to ignore that.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lexington：</span><br>
That's fine. We are dropping by unannounced, after all.<br>
What's that on your whiteboard? One big equation?<br>
<br>
There is a very long equation on her whiteboard, so long it could make a loop around Princeton's room if you laid it out on a single row.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Princeton ：</span><br>
Yeah, it's the proof to Bulschwartz's nil-point problem. I'm nearly finished with it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lexington：</span><br>
I... see...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Princeton ：</span><br>
Oh, pardon my math jargon. It's fine if you don't understand. Anyway, you two came at the perfect time.<br>
...What's the matter, Lexington? If something's on your mind, tell me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lexington：</span><br>
Thank you. But do I really look THAT under the weather?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Princeton ：</span><br>
Well, it's more like... Saratoga told me something has been bothering you lately.<br>
Although, she didn't give me specifics, so I just assumed you coming here has something to do with your problem.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lexington：</span><br>
Hmm. Where to begin...<br>
<br>
Lexington explained her worries to Princeton.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Princeton ：</span><br>
That is a tricky one... I've never even thought about that before, I've just enjoyed your and Saratoga's music.<br>
I daresay I have a knack for math and statistics. The question is, how can I put that to use...<br>
...I've got it! Commander, read this.<br>
<br>
Princeton quickly jots down something on her notepad, then rips the sheet off and folds it up before handing it to me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Princeton ：</span><br>
This may well help solve Lexington's problem.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lexington：</span><br>
Huh? Am I not allowed to read it?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Princeton ：</span><br>
It's, uh, best if it's kept a surprise for you. You know, like how your concerts always end with a surprise.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lexington：</span><br>
I'm not sure I get it, but alright.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Princeton ：</span><br>
I'll say this: data is useful, but it's not everything. It only tells you the probability of things.<br>
This insight is all I can give you. The Commander and other people will need to do the rest. Sorry.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lexington：</span><br>
Don't be. I appreciate your help.<br>
<br>
Confiding in Princeton seems to have helped as Lexington's expression brightens quite a bit.<br>
I unfold the note and start reading it...<br>

4 Man vs. Machine<br>
Lexington and I take a stroll down the port's main road.<br>
She's seemed strangely absent-minded since we left Princeton's room. I wonder why.<br>
I again check the note I received, then weigh our options on what to do next.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lexington：</span><br>
You know, I think Princeton is right about what she said about data.<br>
It's only a probability, not a guarantee that people will like it. But I don't feel like that's fully solved my problem...<br>
<br>
All of a sudden, I notice that the sun has set.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："It's gotten late."</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2："How about we have dinner?"</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lexington：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Oh. Yes, it has. Time flies...<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Goodness, I took up your whole day, didn't I? Sorry, Commander.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''...Dinner, you say? I could use a light meal, actually. Let's go.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lexington：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Well, I suppose we're not finding the answer today, so we might as well.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Besides, I could go for something to eat. Lead the way, Commander.<br>
<br>
We go into the canteen to sate our hunger.<br>
As soon as we step through the door, we're greeted by a strange sight.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Tai Yuan：</span><br>
Please stop, Fu Shun... Leave it be...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Get out of the way! That cursed machine needs to be destroyed! It has no place in the canteen!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lexington：</span><br>
Um... Excuse me, what's on the menu tonight?<br>
I hope it's nothing offensive and that's what you're fighting over...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
Nah, this is about something much bigger than a menu item!<br>
It's that damn cooking machine! It's a crime against humanity!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">An Shan：</span><br>
Aren't you being dramatic? It makes Yat Sen's job easier, simple as that.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Fu Shun：</span><br>
But WE should be helping her cook! Having a machine do it is so boring! And I need an excuse to get up to kitchen hijinks, but that's unrelated.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chang Chun：</span><br>
We could rework it into a homework-solving machine. Processed papers beat processed food.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lexington：</span><br>
The canteen has to feed a lot of people, so isn't machine labor perfect in this scenario?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chang Chun：</span><br>
Hah. You're starting to sound like An Shan.<br>
Sure, it lightens the burden on our cooks, but letting a machine make our food just feels... soulless. At least in my opinion.<br>
Anyway, since we're at an impasse right now, there's not much on the menu to choose from. Here, and bon appetit.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lexington：</span><br>
Thanks. Incidentally, did the machine prepare it?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Chang Chun：</span><br>
Who knows. Human or machine, it should taste the same, no?<br>
<br>
Looks like this debate in the canteen won't end any time soon.<br>
All of a sudden, I notice that the sun has set.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："This got strangely philosophical."</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lexington：</span><br>
Mhm. I suppose they feel things made by a machine have no "soul."<br>
But the food does taste the same... So what actually matters...<br>
<br>
Slowly but steadily, Lexington is getting closer to the answer she's looking for.<br>

5 Always There for You<br>
After dinner, I accompany Lexington to the concert rehearsal room to help tidy it up.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lexington：</span><br>
Here we are, Commander.<br>
With your help, this will be done in a flash.<br>
<br>
She opens the door, and to the surprise of us both...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lexington：</span><br>
Huh? It's already been tidied up?<br>
But why? I said I'd do it myself...<br>
<br>
Not only is all the recording equipment neatly organized, but the floor has also been polished to a mirror sheen, reflecting moonlight coming in through the window.<br>
......<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："When was the last time anyone was here?"</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lexington：</span><br>
A decent while ago. It feels like it's been ages since I last went on stage.<br>
I mainly do background work these days. It makes everyone else's job easier.<br>
Since they're the ones doing the hard work of creating a wonderful performance, it's only fair that I take care of the little things.<br>
Clearly, someone wanted to take on extra work, though.<br>
Hm? I don't remember this being here...<br>
<br>
There is a small box placed on her personal shelf. Whoever cleaned the room must've left it for her.<br>
She opens the box, and an upbeat tune starts playing.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Albacore μ：</span><br>
Surpriiiiise! Got you pretty good, didn't I?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Illustrious μ：</span><br>
You mustn't work yourself too hard, Lexington. Take a well-earned break. We'll all be on stage together again soon!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Admiral Hipper μ：</span><br>
Ugh, do I really have to say this? Fine... Ahem! We'll take care of the small stuff. You just focus on enjoying yourself! Got it?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Cleveland μ：</span><br>
Heya, Lex! Seriously, take a break, alright? You'll burn yourself out if you force yourself to keep working. Don't you worry, the rest of us'll pick up the slack.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
And if I catch you lifting one finger, you bet your butt you're gonna get pranked! I'm already super-duper upset with you for not listening.<br>
I'll only forgive you if you do two things – lay off the work, and bring the Commander to the concert!<br>
<br>
The little box, like a voiced greeting card, finishes playing its message.<br>
We look inside it and find two concert tickets taped to the bottom.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lexington：</span><br>
......<br>
I'm... I'm glad I have friends who look out for me.<br>
<br>
With a serious gaze and tender smile, she eyes the box and the tickets.<br>

6 The Answer is in Your Heart<br>
Lexington and I leave the rehearsal room, find a place to sit, and stargaze.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lexington：</span><br>
What am I supposed to do, Commander?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："The way I see it..."</span>'''''<br>
<br>
"Nobody can deny how hard you work every day, helping people in the way only a big sister can."<br>
"It's also clear that you take being an idol very seriously. But, you have a problem – that you shoulder too many burdens for one person."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lexington：</span><br>
You think I've bitten off more than I can chew?<br>
<br>
"Yes. It doesn't matter if you take a shortcut or two as long as people love your concert."<br>
"I'm not the most well-versed when it comes to idol work, but you shouldn't be afraid to ask others for help. That's what friends are for."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lexington：</span><br>
So it's about the big picture, not the details... Like the food in the canteen. Who or what made it isn't important, sharing it with your friends is.<br>
I think I understand now. Thank you, Commander.<br>
It's about overcoming obstacles alongside other people and celebrating it together.<br>
I can't shoulder everyone's burdens on my own. That's just impossible on every level.<br>
It's no wonder people have been saying they're concerned about me...<br>
I need to rely on others more. Together, we can overcome any challenge we face.<br>
That's the solution to my problem, isn't it?<br>
Thank you, Commander, for spending the day with me and helping me realize this.<br>
I'll make a habit of asking for a helping hand whenever I can.<br>
<br>
"Well, seeing as you've solved your problem..."<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："Let's stay and enjoy our date a while longer."</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lexington：</span><br>
This is a date?! Has it been one, all along?<br>
I suppose, in a way, it is. Darn, I should've realized sooner and said it myself.<br>
Hey, I'm in a singing mood right now. Will you stay and listen?<br>
Think of it like a special concert, just for you, Commander.<br>

Ever since that day, Lexington has been preparing something big.<br>
Tonight, it's finally time for the concert I agreed to come to.<br>
Port - Concert Venue<br>
Although we're only attending as audience members, Lexington is exceptionally fired up.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lexington：</span><br>
Have a glow stick, Commander~<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："Sounds like you're really enjoying yourself."</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lexington：</span><br>
Why wouldn't I be? I'm with you!<br>
Plus, I've got a surprise prepared for you. I think you're going to like it.<br>
Ah, Sara's going on stage. I need to get ready!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
Everyone, it's time for a special feature with someone close to my heart! With who, you wonder? Good question! Can you guess?<br>
What's that? Nobody has any ideas?<br>
Alright, I'll just show you then!<br>
<br>
With a snap of Saratoga's fingers, the spotlights shine down on Lexington, standing right beside me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
It's what you've been asking for! A duet featuring both Lexington sisters!<br>
<br>
The audience bursts into applause.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：(Cheer her on.)</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2："Now that's a wonderful surprise."</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lexington：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Heehee. This will be the best concert of your life.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lexington：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Weren't expecting this, were you? Heehee~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lexington：</span><br>
You're going to love this performance, Commander.<br>
I'll see you after the show♪<br>
<br>
She faces the crowd and throws her hands in the air. She is answered with booming cheering.<br>
The excitement of two big time idols appearing on stage together is nothing short of incredible.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Saratoga：</span><br>
There you have it! Our surprise for you is a comeback performance with my sister! Hope you're all as excited as I am!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Lexington：</span><br>
Thank you all for your heartfelt support! Now, Sara, let us sing!<br>
We dedicate this song to our love and passion for the azure seas!<br>
<br>
Lexington gracefully steps onto the stage.<br>
Tonight, it's not the spotlights lighting up the stage, but rather her luminous presence.<br>
