<br>
On a faraway continent, there is a skyscraper-filled city that knows no night.<br>
Many call it the Sleepless City.<br>
Equal parts elegant and vulgar, this neon paradise both consumes and treasures money like water itself.<br>
The fearless and the fools flock there chasing dreams, a gaping maw of collective greed.<br>
Those living at the base of the Manjuu Tower experience no change...<br>
...But the inside has reached a boiling point. A ticking time bomb of corruption it has become.<br>
I hear someone calling.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">???：</span><br>
......<br>
Wake up.<br>
Wake up, Knight. There's still work to do!<br>
<br>
The haze in my mind gradually clears. First, I see a girl abounding with curiosity.<br>
Second, I see a jail cell so decrepit that it looks ready to collapse at any given moment.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Caught me, huh...?<br>
<br>
I try to recall my memories, but nothing comes up.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">???：</span><br>
So you finally woke up, Knight.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Who are you...?</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">???：</span><br>
Heheh, you don't remember a thing, do you?<br>
Who am I? Not important.<br>
Remembering who YOU are is a lot more important, though.<br>
Commander.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
What are...<br>
<br>
*bzzzt!*<br>
Suddenly, fragmented memories rush into my mind like a flurry of snow.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">Manjuu Guard：</span><br>
Cheep cheep!<br>
Tweet! Cheep cheep cheep!<br>
Cheep! Cheep cheep!<br>
<br>
*KABOOOOM!*<br>
An explosive wave of scorching-hot air blows in from nearby, toppling everything in its path.<br>
Even one of the most powerful people of the Sleepless City, too lofty for its residents to ever look upon, is powerless before it.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">Valiant ：</span><br>
Help... me...<br>
Don't... you see...<br>
This ID... that of the... noble... Valiant...<br>
Save me... and my... fortune will be...<br>
.........<br>
<br>
The CEO is motionless. The item in her hands falls to the ground.<br>
Looking back, it's an odd feeling.<br>
Such an important person had died so unceremoniously before my eyes. I watched it happen, and I did nothing to stop it.<br>
The sight of it was even more shocking than the stun batons brought by security shortly after.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
...Cheers to this crappy world.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：(Try digging around your inside pocket.)</span>'''''<br>
<br>
You obtained 1 Ascension Box!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
The ID card of "The Great"...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">???：</span><br>
That's right.<br>
Climb to the top of the Manjuu Tower with that baby, and you'll be the new master of this Sleepless City.<br>
Saving countless suffering people, becoming the king of a new era, changing millions of lives with a single whim.<br>
Heheheh~ Doesn't that sound fun?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
What should I do?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">???：</span><br>
Do what you gotta do.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
That doesn't really help...?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">???：</span><br>
Too bad. I just wanted it to sound dramatic, really.<br>
By the way, my contact is coming soon.<br>
See you later, you pretty little Knight!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Hold on! At least tell me your name!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">???：</span><br>
Wow. You're a curious one, eh?<br>
Then remember this well. I'm the coolest, cutest, most invinciblest girl under the stars, Pamiat' Merkuria!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pamiat' Merkuria META：</span><br>
A figment of your imagination!<br>
<br>
*KABOOOOM!*<br>

<br>
*KABOOOOM!*<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">Kronshtadt：</span><br>
Aim at the helicopter! Not the prison!<br>
Those prison cells still have high-bounty marks in them! Be more careful!<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">Ognevoy：</span><br>
Waaaaah! I'm sorryyyy!<br>
Firing again... Huh?!<br>
M-my weapons broke?!<br>
<br>
The jail cell's iron-barred window isn't just blown away; a big hole has been made in the wall.<br>
However, one would need the wings of Icarus to reach a prison cell located so high in a tower with security this tight.<br>
Fortunately, one set of steel wings has accomplished just that.<br>
Amidst the booming of the helicopter engine, she descends from the hole in the wall like an angel sent from above.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">???：</span><br>
The famous Commander of the Sleepless City, unmoved even by such violent reception.<br>
We're short on time, so let me introduce myself right away.<br>
I am Agent Arkhangelsk of the Silverwing Resistance.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Arkhangelsk：</span><br>
And my mission is to rescue you, symbol of rebellion – no matter the cost.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：...Symbol of rebellion?</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：Are you sure you have the right person?</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Arkhangelsk：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''You led the attack on her caravan, no?<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Nobody but you could bring down Valiant, the master of the Manjuu Tower.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Arkhangelsk：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''I'd never mistake you for someone else.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Or are you saying that someone other than you led the attack on her caravan?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Arkhangelsk：</span><br>
Tales of your heroism are spreading all over the Sleepless City.<br>
If you join the resistance, our victory is all but assured!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Rebellion...)<br>
<br>
I remember the phantom Pamiat's words.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pamiat' Merkuria META：</span><br>
Climb to the top of the Manjuu Tower with that baby, and you'll be the new master of this Sleepless City.<br>
Saving countless suffering people, becoming the king of a new era, changing millions of lives with a single whim.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
"Do what you gotta do," huh?<br>
Can you take me to the Manjuu Tower?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Arkhangelsk：</span><br>
Don't worry. We'll evacuate you to... Wait, what?<br>
Manjuu Tower? That place has the tightest security in the whole Sleepless City.<br>
Going with this helicopter alone would be suicide!<br>
There's no need for you to go through such a risk again, right? I mean—<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：I have my reasons.</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Arkhangelsk：</span><br>
But...<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">Abercrombie：</span><br>
Tee hee~ Security patrol speaking!<br>
Warning, intruders! There's nowhere left to run~<br>
This is your final warning! Stop resisting and surrender right away!<br>
Otherwise, we cannot guarantee your safety~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Arkhangelsk：</span><br>
Damn. I didn't think Kronshtadt would send backup so fast...<br>
But it's fine. The Resistance means to cooperate with your plans anyway.<br>
...I'll lure security away.<br>
The rest is up to you to figure out.<br>
Good luck to you, Commander.<br>
<br>
After the mysterious agent leaves, the helicopter suddenly rises upward and flies away from the jail.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">Ognevoy：</span><br>
Hooray! The intruders left!<br>
I bet they were all scared 'cause our patrol team came running!<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">Kronshtadt：</span><br>
Don't be a fool, Ognevoy! This isn't just a matter of intruders coming and leaving!<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">Ognevoy：</span><br>
H-Huuuh?! What?!<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">Kronshtadt：</span><br>
Calling all units from the prison! I repeat, calling ALL units on duty!<br>
A helicopter has escaped with a very important target! Be on the lookout for any helicopters not registered with the Sleepless City's management system!<br>
Ognevoy, you stay here! Abercrombie, ensure all water routes are sealed!<br>
I will take responsibility for land routes! Now move!<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">Ognevoy & Abercrombie：</span><br>
- Okaaay! - Roger that!<br>
<br>
The helicopter noise and security vehicle sirens gradually fade away.<br>
It seems Arkhangelsk managed to draw security's attention. That only leaves the question of how I can escape this place.<br>
Jumping out of the hole in the wall is obviously out of the question. Even if I managed to hit water from this height, the surface tension would still kill me.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Am I screwed?<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">???：</span><br>
More the opposite! When things get rough, I say you should go with the flow.<br>
<br>
An unexpected voice comes from the dark of the hallway.<br>
A girl wearing a security uniform peeks in through the prison cell's bars.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Damn! They left someone behind just in case?!)<br>
<br>
Part of me starts to regret not taking the "jump out the window" idea more seriously.<br>
But she suddenly whips out a key and opens the cell door for me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">???：</span><br>
Open sesame! Heheh, come on. I'm not a prison guard!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Phantom Thief Miss Terious：</span><br>
Allen M. Sumner, also known as the phantom thief Miss Terious! Your reputation precedes you, Commander!<br>
It's kind of amazing how easy it was to infiltrate this place.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Are you a member of the resistance, too?</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Phantom Thief Miss Terious：</span><br>
Nope. I'm just a phantom thief flying solo and free. I'll die before I fight for someone else.<br>
I only care about things that pique my interest, such as... you, you little big-shot.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Then you're after me?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Phantom Thief Miss Terious：</span><br>
Heheh, that's right. You've really piqued my interest.<br>
Besides, I hear this prison is where they stow the baddest of the bad.<br>
Stealing a legend like you is the challenge of a lifetime. How could I, the legendary phantom thief, refuse?<br>
Phantom thieves are all about stealing heavily defended things, right?<br>
<br>
Her explanation is simultaneously dubious and overconfident.<br>
But strangely, it convinces me to trust her.<br>
Is it because I've heard that line somewhere before?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Phantom Thief Miss Terious：</span><br>
Hellooo? Don't just stand there like a lump.<br>
They're going to figure out my decoys soon, so we gotta get out of here fast.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Oh, I'm sorry. Let's get going.<br>
Mind leading the way, Miss Terious?<br>

<br>
Prison - Underground Garage<br>
Exit K-03<br>
CAM03 LIVE<br>
The elevator door slowly opens.<br>
I follow phantom thief Miss Terious into an underground garage beneath the prison.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Phantom Thief Miss Terious：</span><br>
Now, get ready for the final step of my escape magic~<br>
As soon as we can find a car, it's bye-bye prison!<br>
Ahh, this was so easy that it was almost boring~<br>
Here I was hoping for some more excitement!<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Allen? What are you talking about?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Phantom Thief Miss Terious：</span><br>
Oh, it's no big deal. I just expected better security given the layout of this place.<br>
If I were them, I'd put an ambush here and let the two escapees fall right into the palm of my hand.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">???：</span><br>
Is that so?<br>
I thought you'd show us some more interesting tricks. How disappointing.<br>
Allen M. Sumner... Or should I say Miss Terious?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Allen M. Sumner：</span><br>
Ack! Inspector Monarch... You again!<br>
Look how shrewd you're being. You want to disrupt things this late in the game?<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">Monarch：</span><br>
I do my best to be a spectator, but sometimes, circumstances dictate that I must act.<br>
<br>
Monarch – the city's police inspector – turns her eyes toward me.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">Monarch：</span><br>
My dear friend, my old partner...<br>
Hahaha... What a sad state of affairs.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Excuse me?</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">Monarch：</span><br>
...Ahem. Sorry, but just go with it for now.<br>
We can discuss old times later. For now, there's something more important that must be done.<br>
Allen M. Sumner, you've pilfered a far greater treasure than I anticipated!<br>
<br>
Monarch raises a hand and snaps.<br>
When she does, the garage's emergency exit is kicked down.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">Ognevoy：</span><br>
Please don't move! No more resisting!<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">Monarch：</span><br>
"A friend in need is a friend indeed." You taught me this.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Allen M. Sumner：</span><br>
(whispering) Wow, she's really got it out for you.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Excuse me? (again)</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Allen M. Sumner：</span><br>
Okay, then. On to plan B!<br>
Now, Artist! Do your thing!<br>
<br>
Sudden gunfire interrupted the tense confrontation.<br>
The source of it is Svirepy's rather antique machine gun, and it has more than enough firepower to make Monarch and Ognevoy take cover.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Artist：</span><br>
Hahahaha! Fight me, assholes!<br>
<br>
Thanks to her merciless fire, the tables turn back in favor of the phantom thief and her companion.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Allen M. Sumner：</span><br>
Alright! Suppressive fire has arrived!<br>
Now go! Take the Commander with you!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Artist：</span><br>
Gotcha!<br>
Symbol of rebellion, Comrade Commander! Come with me!<br>
<br>
A manhole cover at my feet opens up, and Svirepy jumps right inside.<br>
It would be easy to follow her, but I have reasons not to, as well.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Allen, aren't you going to run?</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Allen M. Sumner：</span><br>
*sigh*... You never change, do you? Heheh.<br>
Don't worry about me. You just go ahead and flee.<br>
...Don't just sit there! That little squirt is setting up her heavy weapon as we speak! If you don't wanna die, then get in that manhole!<br>
<br>
I look over to the pillar and see that Ognevoy is, indeed, assembling that same ridiculous weapon she'd fired at the helicopter.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(So I have no choice...)<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：(Go into the manhole.)</span>'''''<br>
<br>
I thought I'd made up my mind, but before jumping in, I turn to look at Monarch and Ognevoy again.<br>
My eyes meet those of my former friend, the police inspector.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">Monarch：</span><br>
Dear friend!<br>
It's not too late to do the right thing!<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">Ognevoy：</span><br>
Full poweeeer!<br>
<br>
Somebody closes the manhole cover, and before long, I hear nothing but an explosion.<br>
In the dark silence, that phantom's voice comes to me again.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pamiat' Merkuria META：</span><br>
It's not over yet. Commander, it's not over.<br>
Go to the Manjuu Tower.<br>
Go to the Manjuu Tower...<br>

Sleepless City - Block 33 Security Office<br>
35 minutes later...<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">Tallinn：</span><br>
Yes? This is Block 33's security office.<br>
...Excuse me? A jailbreak has occurred?<br>
So the criminal has escaped through the sewer and is escaping through this block.<br>
Yes. I understand. I won't let them escape this block, no matter what.<br>
*sigh*... What a world we live in.<br>
This is Tallinn, calling Inspector Kirov. Inspector Kirov, can you hear me?<br>
Suspects are escaping through this block. I'm tracking them through the nanocircuit. Intercept them at once.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">Kirov：</span><br>
Understood. I'll take care of it.<br>
<br>
Block 33 highway entrance 3 minutes later...<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">Kirov：</span><br>
Tallinn, I'm at the target area... But I don't see anything unusual.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">Tallinn：</span><br>
That can't be! The nanocircuit still shows them in this very location.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">Kirov：</span><br>
Is there interference affecting it?<br>
I'll scan the area again. If they've already escaped to another block–<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">???：</span><br>
Ahem. Testing, testing.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">Kirov：</span><br>
Tch. Just as I was warming up my motor – Wha?<br>
<br>
Noticing that she's receiving communication from someone else, Kirov pulls off a quick drift to a stop on her bike.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">???：</span><br>
Aaahahaha! It worked!<br>
Don't waste your effort, kid! Your nanomachines are all mine now!<br>
You're not catchin' Comrade Commander today!<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">Kirov：</span><br>
Who is this?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">???：</span><br>
Ahahahahaaa! My bad! I didn't even introduce myself!<br>
I'm a genius mechanic... no, genius HACKER with the resistance! Haaahahaha!<br>
Your security database calls me... What was it? Soobrazitelny?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Soobrazitelny：</span><br>
Bet your boss Tallinn remembers me well.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">Tallinn：</span><br>
...Of course I do.<br>
The famous city-wide blackout was your doing, wasn't it?<br>
I thought you were gone for good, but it seems you've reared your ugly head again. How do you plan to hurt our fair city this time?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Soobrazitelny：</span><br>
Hurt? Now that's just slander. I joined this resistance because I agreed with their lofty ideals, that's all.<br>
Those alone make them a whole lot better than your police force.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">Kirov：</span><br>
Empty words. From my perspective, all you're doing is interrupting our pursuit of a dangerous criminal.<br>
Obstruction of justice. Is that your lofty ideal?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Soobrazitelny：</span><br>
You peons are all the same. Nothing gets through your sick skulls.<br>
You're not just chasing a criminal. You're chasing the COMMANDER. I wonder how the Commander would feel about that?<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">Kirov：</span><br>
Tch. Just as I was warming up my motor – Wha?<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">Tallinn：</span><br>
It can't be!<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">Kirov：</span><br>
Tallinn...?<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">Tallinn：</span><br>
I don't believe it...! Our security force lost its Commander long ago!<br>
All records of the Commander have been scrubbed... You must be lying!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Soobrazitelny：</span><br>
That's a funny accusation, noble Chief Tallinn.<br>
You're the ones who nest under the Manjuu Tower. I think you know who in this Sleepless City are the real liars.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">Kirov：</span><br>
That's enough. Don't let her speak another—<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">Tallinn：</span><br>
No. Let her talk.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">Kirov：</span><br>
Tallinn?<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">Tallinn：</span><br>
You have one last chance. Skip the pointless noise and tell us everything. Otherwise, I'll personally dig you out of the depths of hell and judge you myself!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Soobrazitelny：</span><br>
Aaahahaha! I'd like to see you try!<br>
Here's the access key to your little security database. See for yourself!<br>
By the way, Comrade Commander has the Ascension Box right now. You're clever, Tallinn – you must know what that means.<br>
Are you just gonna watch this city sink all the way, or are you gonna plug the holes? That depends on you!<br>
See ya never!<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">Kirov：</span><br>
You little...!<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">Tallinn：</span><br>
Calm down, Kirov.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">Kirov：</span><br>
Tallinn... You don't seriously believe her, do you?<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">Tallinn：</span><br>
......<br>
.............<br>
Remind me of our motto, Kirov.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">Kirov：</span><br>
"To maintain the principles of justice..."<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">Tallinn：</span><br>
"...And to see justice done."<br>
Come back, Kirov.<br>
I'm going to discuss things with other blocks' security offices.<br>

Sleepless City - Block 13, Abandoned Arcade<br>
We hide out in several places for nearly an hour until we finally arrive at a safe house.<br>
It's an abandoned arcade. Svirepy, the Artist, seems to know a lot about this place.<br>
Apparently looking for a change of pace, she continues to fiddle with a barely-operating crane game.<br>
...She keeps trying, but she fails to win anything.<br>
Realizing the tokens in her pocket have run out, she turns around to face me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Artist：</span><br>
Tch. Too much going on today to focus.<br>
I was gonna ask you if you wanted to play, but too bad.<br>
<br>
She shrugs and leans against a shelf covered in graffiti.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Is she... trying to chat with me, or?)<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Svire... Ahem. I don't think I've gotten your name, stranger.</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Artist：</span><br>
Hmph. Names don't mean much in this city.<br>
...D-don't look at me like that. Fine, it's Svirepy.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Svirepy：</span><br>
Ahem. I'd prefer if you used my pseudonym, though.<br>
I'm the Artist. I use this city as a canvas, painting over it with the rule of art.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Hmm... So that graffiti there is one of your rules?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Svirepy：</span><br>
Hahaha, close enough! Let's make it simpler – I'M the rules here.<br>
Rules only have meaning when you enforce them. This is my territory, so I could just break into this game and take the prizes if I wanted.<br>
But that breaks a rule, and that's lame as hell.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：So your philosophy is that we should all follow the rules?</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：But aren't you painting over the rules?</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Svirepy：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Humans make the rules, and humans enforce them.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''I'm no exception!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Svirepy：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Ahahaha! C'mon, I gotta leave some canvas for other artists.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Svirepy：</span><br>
Most of all, I was born and raised in this city. I love it like I love myself.<br>
I just can't stand the scum that pollute it and act like they're better than us.<br>
...Mm?<br>
Someone's eavesdropping on us.<br>
<span style="color:#fef15e;">???：</span><br>
Aww, you got me...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Svirepy：</span><br>
Quit hiding, already. Show yourself!<br>
<br>
While Svirepy talks about her ideals, she suddenly becomes alert and yells at the arcade door.<br>
When she does, the dusty door opens with a creak.<br>
From it appears a girl wearing detective clothes and holding bread in her mouth.<br>
<span style="color:#fef15e;">Private Detective：</span><br>
G-good evening~<br>
<span style="color:#fef15e;">Volga：</span><br>
Don't be so tense~ As you can see, I'm just a private detective...<br>
U-umm... I TOTALLY agree with you, Svirepy!<br>
The rules of this city need to be changed from the bottom up!<br>
...I've finally found you, legend of the Sleepless City.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：You mean me?</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#fef15e;">Volga：</span><br>
Don't be surprised. You're more famous in this city than you think.<br>
Famous Commander of the security force, famous do-gooder of downtown... You're all over the history of this city. *munch*<br>
<br>
The oddly familiar private detective Volga takes a bite of her bread before turning serious.<br>
<span style="color:#fef15e;">Volga：</span><br>
...I come with an invitation.<br>
My client is willing to take you to the Manjuu Tower – as long as you're willing to meet with her.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：She won't take no for an answer, will she?</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#fef15e;">Volga：</span><br>
I-I wonder... Can I take that as a yes, though?<br>
Hehehe, you're just like my client said~ She knew you wouldn't refuse.<br>
This means I lost my bet, though... It's your victory, subordinate of the Queen.<br>
<span style="color:#fef15e;">Contact：</span><br>
The Queen never loses, Detective.<br>
<br>
A voice, full of firm resolve, was accompanied by the appearance of another girl from the door.<br>
<span style="color:#fef15e;">Contact：</span><br>
Do not doubt the Queen's decisions.<br>
<span style="color:#fef15e;">Volga：</span><br>
Oh, I-I'm sorry...<br>
Anyway, I should go... Commander, you just work with the Contact from now on.<br>
Oh, and I'll get rid of any trace that we met here~<br>
<span style="color:#fef15e;">Contact：</span><br>
Right. Come with me.<br>

<br>
Sleepless City - ??? Queen's HQ<br>
The silent Contact guides us to a fancy building.<br>
I was surprised to learn that the mafia headquarters were located in the most lively place in the city, but we get an audience with the Queen without issue.<br>
However...<br>
<span style="color:#fef15e;">Contact：</span><br>
Svirepy, stay here.<br>
Only the Commander may meet with the Queen.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Svirepy：</span><br>
What the hell?<br>
That's not what you said before.<br>
<span style="color:#fef15e;">Contact：</span><br>
Only the Commander was invited. Accept it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Svirepy：</span><br>
Wha?! You wanna get your ass kicked?!<br>
<span style="color:#fef15e;">Contact：</span><br>
.........<br>
I'm sorry. The Queen's orders are absolute.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：I guess we have no choice...</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：I'll go alone.</span>'''''<br>
<br>
Thus, I finally arrive at the Queen's office.<br>
As soon as I open the door, I make eye contact with her. My heart skips a beat.<br>
Her name naturally leaves my mouth, as if a long-dormant memory has been awakened.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Queen Poltava.</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#fef15e;">Poltava：</span><br>
Isn't that sweet? You remember me.<br>
I thought the Sleepless City would get boring when I heard of your disappearance. How happy I am to be proven wrong.<br>
And you still have your old charm... You're a tough one, Commander of the security force.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Did we know each other...?<br>
<span style="color:#fef15e;">Poltava：</span><br>
Heehee... More than that. We were rivals.<br>
But don't worry. You're my guest, and I'm not the type of queen to be rude to guests.<br>
Besides... A much greater cause awaits us, no?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
Us...?<br>
<span style="color:#fef15e;">Poltava：</span><br>
Yes. Us.<br>
I'll get right to business.<br>
The Ascension Box. You have it, yes?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：I do, but...</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：How did you...</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#fef15e;">Poltava：</span><br>
Heehee♪ The resistance isn't the only group capable of launching an attack on her, you know.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
So you're the ones who attacked Valiant...<br>
<span style="color:#fef15e;">Poltava：</span><br>
Oh, I wonder. Who knows, really?<br>
Let's be frank. I'm happy to take you to the Manjuu Tower.<br>
In exchange, when you connect to the city's main server, I need you to do some... fiddling for me.<br>
That is, I want you to make US the masters of this Sleepless City.<br>
Once that is done, a new contract will be bound. The order of this city can be rebuilt.<br>
You may lead in the light, and I will rule as Queen from the shadows. Doesn't that sound wonderful?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Doesn't that mean the Sleepless City won't change?</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#fef15e;">Poltava：</span><br>
Heehee. Of course, it will change a little. But like human history, things here will only repeat in perpetuity.<br>
If we can right the balance of power, the Manjuu Tower won't collapse.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
......<br>
<span style="color:#fef15e;">Poltava：</span><br>
You seem as troubled as I'd expected.<br>
Think about it as much as you need to. It's not as if you need to answer now.<br>
I'm sure you'll understand everything when you reach the top of the tower.<br>
...My, security works quickly. It seems the delivery person I arranged for has already arrived.<br>
Farewell, Comrade Commander. We may never meet again, but...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">???：</span><br>
Comrade Commander, get down!<br>
<br>
A wave of intense gunfire destroyed the glass window behind Poltava's throne.<br>
Instantly after, a flash bang was tossed into the office.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
...!<br>
<br>
I'm suddenly tied up and dragged away by some intense force.<br>
In the midst of the white, I feel as if I've been thrown into a vacuum without gravity.<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(Did they just throw me out of the building?!)<br>

<br>
Ten minutes later...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
That building is the Manjuu Tower.<br>
I hope you're satisfied with your delivery.<br>
Allow me to introduce myself properly. I'm Sovetsky Soyuz, a member of the resistance.<br>
Tallinn from Block 33's security office contacted me.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：Tallinn did that?</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
Yep. I don't know the details, but security told me everything.<br>
If not for their nanocircuit, I wouldn't have found you anywhere near as quickly.<br>
They promised to keep the riots from getting close to the Manjuu Tower, too.<br>
As a result, it all worked out.<br>
Charging in head-on would be reckless. We'll have to detour around the security force's defensive line.<br>
We're running straight up to the top floor of the tower. Get ready.<br>
<br>
The already-familiar weightlessness comes over me again, and we charge directly to the top-floor office of the Manjuu Tower.<br>
*CRASH!*<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
...We've arrived at the target area.<br>
Through that elevator, we can reach the data center up above.<br>
This is the end. It's up to you to remake the Sleepless City with your own hands...<br>
And end all of this.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">???：</span><br>
Heehee. I will say, it is an admirable idea.<br>
However... You're far too naïve.<br>
Well done on a successful delivery, Agent Arctic Hare – Sovetsky Soyuz.<br>
<br>
The leather chair behind the office's desk spins around to reveal the person sitting in it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
Boss... Avrora?<br>
<span style="color:#3498DB;" class="shikikanname">指挥官</span>：<br>
(They know each other?)<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
Why are you here, Boss?"<br>
W-wait. It can't be...<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">Avrora：</span><br>
Well, aren't you smart?<br>
You already understand the situation. But of course – you are my dear subordinate.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
The resistance... was working with the Great all along?<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">Avrora：</span><br>
Working WITH the Great? Hmm, not quite.<br>
The Great doesn't understand that the resistance is the true master of the city.<br>
Without the resistance, the order of this city would have collapsed a long time ago.<br>
The hope we provide unites this city.<br>
Unfortunately, that manjuu fool is in cahoots with the mafia now...<br>
He doesn't know that Poltava's ambition won't be so easily sated...<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：So the resistance attacked Valiant, after all?</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">Avrora：</span><br>
Heehee, how slanderous. I didn't fire the gun.<br>
But that's enough. This farce is coming to an end.<br>
Playtime is over, Knight. Why don't you just give up and hand over the Ascension Box?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：I refuse...</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">Avrora：</span><br>
Is that so?<br>
Do it, Agent Arctic Hare.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
......<br>
.........<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">Avrora：</span><br>
Wh-why aren't you doing it?<br>
...!<br>
<br>
By the time Avrora turns to Soyuz, a flash bang is already on its way to her.<br>
*CRASH!*<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">Avrora：</span><br>
Kh... You betray me?!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
Comrade Commander, this way!<br>
<br>
"Thank you for using the Manjuu Tower elevator. Selection: top floor."<br>
"Please input access key."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
Comrade Commander, use the Ascension Box!<br>
There's no time—<br>
<br>
There's a whoosh as the pursuer's bullet strikes the wall of the elevator.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">Avrora：</span><br>
I won't let you go that easily...!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Sovetsky Soyuz：</span><br>
Leave her to me. Commander... Do the right thing!<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：(Use the Ascension Box.)</span>'''''<br>
<br>
You used the Ascension Box!<br>
Welcome back, Administrator. Have a pleasant day.<br>
<span style="color:#ff9b93;">Avrora：</span><br>
Noooooo!<br>
<br>
Avrora fires a few more shots, but an energy barrier is deployed just in time to stop them.<br>
The elevator door inexorably closes.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Pamiat' Merkuria META：</span><br>
It's time to end this, Knight.<br>
<br>
.........<br>

<br>
When the elevator door opens, a data center like one in a Sci-Fi movie comes into view.<br>
This is the source of the megacorporation's ability to control the city. With the combined power of the nanocircuit and supercomputing technology, almost no secrets can remain secret.<br>
Almost.<br>
I enter the data center, and a pale blue hologram appears before me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">TB：</span><br>
Welcome to the data center, Commander.<br>
I have given you administrator privileges.<br>
Awaiting orders.<br>

All that remains is rubble and ruin.<br>

Perhaps, the order of the city is not a bad thing after all...<br>

It isn't an order. For the first time, they are presented with a choice.<br>
How would the city change if all of the people inside were the lords that governed the city?<br>
None could imagine what lay ahead.<br>
The people of the Sleepless City witness a new world for the first time.<br>
Their lives still aren't perfect. Each individual situation may not be ideal. Pain is a very real part of the process.<br>
However, the story has become theirs – a story of the people.<br>
