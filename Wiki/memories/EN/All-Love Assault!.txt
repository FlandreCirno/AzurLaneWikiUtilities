All-Love Assault!<br>
<br>
1. A Pink Letter<br>
It's a clear, sunny day at the port...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Blücher：</span><br>
Heheh☆ Good morning, Commander! It's a beautiful day, so let's go on a date after work!<br>
Where should we go? The amusement park? The aquarium? A restaurant? The movie theater? Or maybe just a walk around the port?<br>
<br>
"Hmm... I still need to get through these documents."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Blücher：</span><br>
Earth to Commander! Don't ignore me like that!<br>
<br>
This needy girl, Blücher, is my secretary. She should be assisting me with my work around the office, but instead she's badgering me about date plans.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Blücher：</span><br>
Commander! Look at me! You can afford to put your paperwork on hold for one second!<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：(Shoot her a quick glance)</span>'''''<br>
<br>
Taking her words at face value, I look at her for exactly one second, then resume my work.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Blücher：</span><br>
Wooow! You meanie! I need more attention than that!<br>
<br>
"I'm sorry, but I have a job to do."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Blücher：</span><br>
It's not like you have THAT much work! I'm here to help, remember? Let's get out of this place and go on a date, come on!<br>
<br>
Silently, I point to the stack of documents on my desk.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Blücher：</span><br>
Fiiine. Simply being with you all the time is enough to make me the happiest girl alive anyway♪<br>
Just know that there are no breaks on the Blücher train. It's on a one-way trip to our dream romance! Heheh☆<br>
<br>
"Noted. Now could you go through the documents regarding the upcoming exercise?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Blücher：</span><br>
Not until you answer my question! You didn't say where we're going for our date after this shift!<br>
Tell you what, I'll do some work in exchange for your loving embrace. I need hugs from you to get the energy to do anything!<br>
Heehee... Doesn't having me around make you happy?<br>
Hey! Commandeeer! Heeeey!<br>
<br>
.........<br>
I'll take care of her later. For now, I have to focus on my paperwork...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Blücher：</span><br>
Hehehe... Commandeeer... Gimme a hug...<br>
<br>
While I wasn't looking, Blücher had fallen asleep on the desk next to mine.<br>
At least I managed to finish a good chunk of work without her. Come to think of it, why DID I appoint her as my secretary?<br>
On second glance, I notice her hand is resting on a pink letter.<br>
It looks to be a love letter... addressed to me.<br>

2. Rain or Shine<br>
It's a dark, rainy day at the port...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Blücher：</span><br>
Aww... This sucks. I wanted to go on a date with the Commander today...<br>
...Whoa, speak of the devil! Hey, Commander!<br>
Heheh☆ Is this a coincidence, or were you coming to see me, hmm?<br>
<br>
As I turn the corner leading to my office, I bump into Blücher. She's been waiting here for me.<br>
"Let me guess. You want me to take you on that date you decided on."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Blücher：</span><br>
Yup! You promised we would! You ready to head out?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："I thought we'd go in the evening?"</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2："It's pouring outside."</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项3："Let's go!"</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Blücher：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Yeah, but you're here 'cause you wanted to go now, right?<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Don't tell me you were gonna sit down and start working. That's not gonna happen!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Blücher：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''So what? I don't care~<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''As long as I'm with you, the forecast is all sunshine and clear skies in my heart!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Blücher：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项3）</span>'''''Heheh☆ This rainy day's about to get a whole lot brighter!<br>
<br>
She and I go on a stroll around the port in the rain.<br>
Then, we pass by the Iron Blood dormitory and come across a friendly face.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Blücher：</span><br>
Morning, Eugen! Whatcha doing? Going for a walk?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Well, if it isn't the Commander and my favorite loudmouth.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Blücher：</span><br>
Hmph! That's no way to talk to your sister!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
Yes, yes, I'm so very sorry. Anyway, what are you two up to? Are you on, dare I ask, a date?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："We're just walking around the port together."</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2："Yeah, you could say that."</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Blücher：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Don't mince your words, Commander! Yes, we ARE on a date!<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Let me make this clear! We're not "just walking around the port," we're on a romantic stroll!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Uh-huh. I see.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Prinz Eugen：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Oh my... You two sure got friendly while I wasn't looking.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''A little warning, Commander – she is extremely passionate when it comes to dates. Try to keep your wits about you, alright?<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Blücher：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Heheh☆ Love is meant to be expressed loud and clear, you know!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Blücher：</span><br>
C'mon, let's get moving, Commander! I've figured out where we're going next. You and I are gonna spend the whooole day together♪<br>

<br>
3. Warmer Than the Sun<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Blücher：</span><br>
It's sunny outside! Perfect weather for a date, right? Heheh☆<br>
<br>
For once, I have two days off in a row, and Blücher has taken me to the commercial district first thing in the morning.<br>
"Are you sure you don't want to spend the day relaxing indoors instead?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Blücher：</span><br>
Thanks, but no thanks. To me, there's no better way to relax than simply being with you!<br>
<br>
"Alright then. I'll stick around as long as you want me to."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Blücher：</span><br>
Great, then follow me! There's a ton of places I want to go that we couldn't when it rained!<br>
<br>
Our first destination: a boba café...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Blücher：</span><br>
Hey, lemme taste yours!<br>
*sip*... It's kind of... bland. Are you not a fan of sweet stuff, Commander?<br>
You don't know what you're missing out on! Try some of mine♪<br>
<br>
She shoves her boba tea in my face. Since she insists, I take a sip. It tastes extremely sweet, almost like liquid sugar.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Blücher：</span><br>
Heheh☆ We just shared an indirect kiss~<br>
Boba tea is at its best when it's super sweet! Just like our love♡<br>
<br>
Next up: the amusement park...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Blücher：</span><br>
Ooh, that ride looks fun! Let's go on that, Commander!<br>
<br>
"The roller coaster? I thought you'd want to go on the merry-go-round first, knowing how much you love chit-chatting."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Blücher：</span><br>
Of course we'll ride that too! But we're doing the roller coaster first!<br>
When we go downhill, you'll feel afraid and hug me, turning your feelings of fear into feelings of love for me! That's how it works!<br>
<br>
It sounds like she's describing the psychological phenomenon known as misattribution of arousal.<br>
Considering I've weathered storms aboard command ships before, I doubt a roller coaster can faze me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Blücher：</span><br>
C'mon, don't just stand there! The roller coaster's arriving at the station!<br>
After this, we'll totally try out the haunted house! Heheh☆<br>
<br>
And finally: the movie theater...<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Blücher：</span><br>
*sob*... The final scene with the proposal was so good it made me cry!<br>
<br>
"While it was a phenomenal movie, it was odd how a shipwreck was the start of it all."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Blücher：</span><br>
That's why I picked it! The only time you're in danger is at sea.<br>
If you ever got shipwrecked, I'd sail across the seas to rescue you. Oh, it'd be just like the end of the movie...<br>
<br>
She gently grasps my hand with hers. It feels soft.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：(Grasp hers back)</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：(Give her a tender hug)</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Blücher：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Heheh♡ Your hand is so warm~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Blücher：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Heheh♡ I feel like I'm gonna explode with love! I've just gotta hug you back~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Blücher：</span><br>
A movie may come to an end, but my love for you is endless♪<br>
I wanna be with you forever and ever, Commander~<br>
I hope we'll always be together, whatever happens!<br>

4. To Go Beyond the Port<br>
It's a regular, uneventful day...<br>
Today it's back to work. I'm chewing through paperwork when suddenly, Blücher speaks up.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Blücher：</span><br>
Hmm... Where should we go on a date after work today...<br>
Maybe the Scharlachroter Tresen? No, we've been there so many times you're probably bored with it...<br>
What about the aquarium? It's comfy and tranquil, but we won't have much time before they close...<br>
Thoughts, Commander? Where do you wanna go?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："Scharlachroter Tresen."</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2："The aquarium."</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项3："You decide."</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项4："I'm working overtime today."</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Blücher：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Heheh☆ Then that's where we'll go!<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Eugen recommended the coffee soda with extra sugar. We should give it a try! I bet it tastes as sweet as my love does!<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Oh boy, I can't wait for this shift to end!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Blücher：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Heheh☆ Aquarium it is! Mind if I go grab my camera before we head out?<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''I wanna take pics of the fish, and more importantly, of you, my sweetheart~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Blücher：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项3）</span>'''''Heheh☆ The place doesn't matter as long as I'm there, am I right?<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项3）</span>'''''I couldn't agree more~ Wherever I am, I'm happy if you're by my side♪<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项3）</span>'''''I love you so much, Commander! I'll let my gut decide where we'll go!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Blücher：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项4）</span>'''''NO! You are NOT working overtime, full stop!<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项4）</span>'''''Hmph! If you're gonna be that way, I'll just decide on my own!<br>
<br>
Eugen was right about Blücher. She is mind-bogglingly passionate when it comes to dates.<br>
Of course, that's just how she expresses her honest – albeit overbearing – affection.<br>
Having known her for a while now, I've more or less gotten used to it.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Blücher：</span><br>
...There we go, all done! I've even made plans for dates several days from now~<br>
Oh, by the way! I wanna travel somewhere with you on your next holiday! Like to a ski resort or something!<br>
<br>
"You want to go skiing?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Blücher：</span><br>
Yeah! I know a great resort! It just takes some time to get there~<br>
We've been all around the port already, and I wanna see the world with you!<br>
That, and I wanna say and hear "I love you" in novel, romantic places~ Heheh♡<br>

5. Romance Snowmance<br>
Northern Parliament - Ski Resort<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Blücher：</span><br>
Heheh☆ Look at me, Commander!<br>
This place is AWESOME! Just like Avrora said!<br>
<br>
Blücher and I are at a mountain ski resort in the Northern Parliament, open only to shipgirls.<br>
As a pleasantly cold breeze brushes against my cheek, I think to myself what a perfect vacation destination this is, particularly for skiing enthusiasts.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Blücher：</span><br>
This is the best date ever! I love you, Commandeeer!<br>
...What? There's no echo! Isn't it supposed to echo when you shout on a mountain?<br>
<br>
"Maybe all the snow is dampening the noise."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Blücher：</span><br>
Makes sense, actually. You're so smart!<br>
<br>
Blücher, donning her winter gear, zips right past me on her snowboard, a cloud of snow trailing behind her.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Blücher：</span><br>
Heheh☆ Think you can catch up with me, Commander?<br>
...You don't wanna snowboard? Then how abooout... you catch me in your arms, hmm?<br>
<br>
She makes a u-turn and uses her speed to reach a slope just above me.<br>
...I know where this is going.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Blücher：</span><br>
Commandeeer! Turn around and give me a big hug!<br>
<br>
She jumps off the slope, arms extended, right towards me.<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：(Catch her with grace)</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：(Catch her while trying not to panic)</span>'''''<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Predicting where she's going to land, I run over and extend my arms.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''She soars through the air squarely into my arms and I manage to catch her.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Blücher：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Heheh☆ Ten out of ten catch, Commander~<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''That was a heart-thumping moment in more ways than one~♡<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Fearing for her well-being, I bumble my way forward and try to catch her.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''However, I act without thinking and lose my balance. I fall on my face in the snow, and so does she.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Luckily, neither of us is hurt thanks to the deep snow.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Blücher：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Eep! That's cold... I got snow under my clothes...<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''...You know what would warm me up? A nice, loving hug~ Heheh♡<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Blücher：</span><br>
I can't call it a day until we've snowboarded at least once together~ C'mon, let's go!<br>
<br>
The passion she radiates could melt all the snow in the world.<br>

6. As Bright as the Stars<br>
The moon hangs high in the clear night sky.<br>
Blücher decided we're having a date tonight. I arrive at the spot she told me to meet her.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Blücher：</span><br>
Heheh☆ Evening, Commander!<br>
Sorry for hitting you up this late in the night.<br>
I just wanted to see you so, so badly that I couldn't sleep!<br>
<br>
"It's fine. I don't have anything important to do anyway."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Blücher：</span><br>
Great! Now let's go check out the stalls by the Sakura Empire's dorm!<br>
They're still open, last I checked, so we should be able to nab some yummy food!<br>
<br>
We go from stall to stall, amassing a smorgasbord of Sakura Empire street food under the starry sky.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Blücher：</span><br>
Takoyaki, tempura, and taiyaki oh my! And of course, oden!<br>
Mmm, this is sooo good! Delicious food and dates go together like bread and butter♪<br>
Here, have this takoyaki, Commander! It's my gift to you for going out with me tonight~<br>
<br>
We chow down while we walk, eventually ending up just outside the Iron Blood dormitory.<br>
It's then that I realize that this nighttime date took away all the fatigue I accumulated during my shift today.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Blücher：</span><br>
Heheh☆ Thanks a lot for hanging out with me!<br>
Geesh, it's late... Time to say goodnight. But first!<br>
<br>
She extends her arms and looks at me eagerly.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Blücher：</span><br>
I want to wrap up the date on a sweet note, you know?<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1：(Give her a hug)</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2：(Gently flick her forehead)</span>'''''<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Blücher：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''Heheh♡ Thanks for fully recharging my batteries~<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项1）</span>'''''You're so sweet, Commander. I love you~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Blücher：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Ow! That hurt... You can be a real meanie sometimes.<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''But that's okay, because I love you! And it still energized me a little bit~<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Blücher：</span><br>
Anyway! It's bedtime. Thanks for going on a last-minute date with me today~ I'll see you tomorrow, Commander!<br>

'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项1："Good morning."</span>'''''<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">选择项2："Uh, good day?"</span>'''''<br>

<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Blücher：</span><br>

'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项2）</span>'''''Besides, it's always morning until you've had breakfast!<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Blücher：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项3）</span>'''''Evening? Uh-oh, I think something's wrong with you. I'd better call Vestal right away...<br>
<br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项3）</span>'''''"I was just joking to see how you'd react. Please put the phone down."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Blücher：</span><br>
'''''<span style="color:black;">（选择项3）</span>'''''Alrighty then~ In that case, good evening to you too♪<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Blücher：</span><br>
Hey, did you dream of me last night? The look on your face says you did~<br>
On that note, I have a small present for you~<br>
<br>
"A present? What's the occasion?"<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Blücher：</span><br>
It's, uhh... You know! To celebrate our 100-day wedding anniversary!<br>
<br>
"How nice."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Blücher：</span><br>
That, and to commemorate all the sweet and love-packed memories we've made!<br>
I'm not expecting anything, but I sure would love something in return~<br>
Like a warm hug coupled with a loving kiss, for instance~<br>
<br>
She's either thinking out loud, or hinting at what she's going to do next.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Blücher：</span><br>
Commander! Eyes on me!<br>
And don't think about shutting them! I want your full, undivided attention~<br>
<br>
I turn to face her and realize she's standing right next to me. Her puckered lips graze my cheek.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Blücher：</span><br>
*smooch*!<br>
<br>
The warmth of a gentle kiss spreads through me.<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Blücher：</span><br>
Heheh☆ Gotcha! I'll make do with that for now~<br>
Anyway, it's time we get to work!<br>
...Hm? What's up, Commander? Waiting for something?<br>
<br>
"You left me a bit stunned by changing gears just like that."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Blücher：</span><br>
Well, what are we gonna do if not work? Unless... you wanna go on a date?<br>
<br>
"I'm feeling a little light-headed. I can't exactly focus right now."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Blücher：</span><br>
Oh no! You sound sick! We can't let you work like this!<br>
Okay, forget about work, how about I take you to the infirmary?<br>
<br>
"It doesn't seem like we have any other option."<br>
<span style="color:#4eb24e;">Blücher：</span><br>
Heheh☆ We're going on an infirmary date~ Come on, let's go♡<br>
